Books / Problems for Statistics Undergrad Wanting to Enter Tech (x-post from r/statistics),6,13,False,False,False,datascience,1483349524,True,"Hey everyone, I am about to get my B.S in Applied Mathematics and Minor in Statistics in 5 months from one of the top schools in the University of California system and I am at a loss as to what sort of preparation I should be doing for any data science jobs that would qualify for after graduating. I have experience in R, Stata, some minor experience in C++ and a basic ability to write in SQL and Python. I also completed a 10 week internship with a utility company that taught me some, albeit basic, methods for implementing machine learning to produce predictions models for large datasets.

My questions are more specifically phrased as follows:

1. How should I improve on my Python skills with respect to statistics applications? Nearly all of the resources I find online about improving one's Python skills with respect to the tech industry focus more on the coding aspect than on statistical analyses. For example, most of my CS friends tout the Cracking the Coding Interview book as one that I should know cold yet it does not focus at all on statistical applications. Should I be utilizing these resources?

2. What kind of tech jobs with a statistics background do not require an MS or PhD? I am not sure that I would want to pursue either in the future as my theoretical math skills and understanding are rather shaky. Yet nearly all of the jobs I find on my university career site are oriented to individuals with MS or PhDs in Stats or CS.

3. What kinds of career fairs should I be attending? The general one by my university has companies that are generally not looking for very technical roles for their hires yet the CS career fairs naturally are looking for very technical CS students.

Overall, should I be doing the same things as my CS friends to make myself more attractive to tech companies (ie interview prepping coding problems, hackathons, attending technical career fairs oriented to CS majors, etc.) or should I be focusing on something else entirely?

Generally, I have an interest in predictive modeling but I am unsure of what I generally should be doing and internet, and university resources, give many conflicting answers on the topic.

Thanks for all your guys help!

TLDR: Almost a recent stats-oriented grad unsure of what steps I should take in the next 4-5 months to prep myself to enter the tech (data science) field."

Opinions on Organizing Niche Scientific File Formats in a Filesystem for Data Analysis (x-post from r/dataengineering),10,6,False,False,False,datascience,1483383844,True,"Hello data scientists!

I'm research assistant at neuroimaging lab that is behind a large-scale data sharing project. Recently, we've been organizing our data (brain images stored in a modified version of a medical imaging file format) on a filesystem according to a standard proposed within our field (the Brain Imaging Data Structure / BIDS; http://bids.neuroimaging.io/). Essentially, the way this standard works is that file names are composed of multiple key-value pairs. The key and value are separated by a dash, and distinct key-value pairs are delimited by an underscore. So the file name: 'sub-01_ses-01_task-stroop_bold.nii.gz' would indicate that the file contained task-related data from the first session of subject 1 where the subject performed a stroop task in the MRI scanner ('.nii.gz' is the format, NifTI compressed w/ gzip and 'bold' describes the type of MRI sequence used for imaging). This file would be nested within several directories- the hierarchy would be composed of some of the key-value pairs as well as a directory name that indicates whether the scan was task-related or just a single volume anatomical image (so the file in the above example might be stored at 'basedirectory/sub-01/ses-01/func/sub-01_ses-01_task-stroop_bold.nii.gz'). Additional metadata for the file would be stored within a JSON file with a filename that is identical to the file's except for the filename extension.

Since my background isn't in either comp sci or stats originally, I was wondering what people from these fields (or who've successfully migrated to data science / engineering from an unrelated field) might think of this manner of dealing with data. I'm also wondering if there isn't a more generalized scheme for organizing datasets on filesystems / dealing with proprietary or niche formats.

One thing that I've come across is that many people are opposed to working with data entirely on a filesystem, preferring instead that it be in a database of some flavor (NoSQL, SQL, etc) due to increased performance. Would this preference still hold for niche scientific data formats? If so, what kind of database would be ideal for this kind of problem? I was looking at Elasticsearch / other document-based databases, but I'm still a little new to this and was wondering how a more experienced data engineer might approach this problem."

"Why do so many jobs in ""data science"" want a masters or PHD ?",64,3,False,False,False,datascience,1483530150,True,"Have worked as a data analyst for a long time. This confuses me. 

Do these recruiters even know what a masters degree is ? One of them included people with a masters in economics for a data science job. 

FYI - I can't afford the fees to get a masters. 

EDIT:

Oh - I am from Australia.

Okay you guys are not really answering my questions. You're telling me why a PHD is superior to an undergraduate degree. No shit. That should be obvious. Basically this tells me one of two things: Either these jobs are for actual scientists in research or you're just trying to corner market and protect. But it still doesn't answer the question. 

What is exactly about the JOB of a data scientist that requires a Masters or PHD that cannot be achieved through work experience ? When you ask for a masters in ""something technical"" by a recruiter that is NOT telling me that the job is necessarily a scientific one for a variety of reasons. It is starting to sound a lot like qualification inflation. What I suspect is that the recruiter is sick of getting applications (due to the recent hype) and has decided to slap the term ""masters"" on it to discourage applications from so many people. I don't know this for sure which is why I am asking. What exactly does a data scientist do ? Why do you need a masters for it ?

I have a lot of experience as a data analyst. Saying ""SQL is not taught in undergraduate so you need a PHD to learn SQL and Python"" is not helpful. I already know both of them. Maybe even better than a PHD graduate, who knows.  I am looking for a career pivot as I am getting very, very bored. Getting a masters is not an option. Even if the tuition was zero, I'd be giving up at least 2 years of income, then would be back to square 0 looking for work. I haven't had to look for a job in almost 10 years.

If I have misread the job title of a ""Data Scientist"" and this is a job requiring actual scientists, then fine that is not an option for a career change. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing for now and see what else is available. Also if this has become hyper competitive due to the hype, then I also don't want it.  

I wish someone had told me my statistics degree was going to be useless without a masters. I would have just done computer science instead.

I am very interested in everything related to AI. I am currently working as a programmer, but for some reason I don't find pure programming to be that fulfilling. I have always been interested in Mathematics, and thus data science is my main area of interest.

I am going for my MS this year, but I am a bit confused as to whether I should go for MS in Data Science or MS in CS. I've read a lot about this topic, and some people insist that data science is just a trend that will wane, and instead of an MS in purely data science which is pretty narrow, I am better off pursuing MS in CS and take some extra electives related to DS.

Would really like some practical advice on this."

I've heard about PowerBI but I'd probably need to create more complicated plots with, for instance, Python/JavaScript by performing some computations and interactivity.

That said, the more theoretical aspects of some of the hard core math based degrees start to scare me off. I was an engineer as an undergrad and took three semesters of calc, differential equations, and linear algebra so I have a background in those areas. However, none of my classes dealt with proving theorems or needing any in depth understanding of the actual theories behind the math. Also, I've only taken maybe 2 stats courses as an undergrad. all of this was a few years ago at this point. All of this is to say that going for a masters in statistics is a bit of a terrifying proposition.

Survey analysis: best way to split and predict?,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1483988716,True,"Below is an exercise I've completed once, and am gearing up to do again. I know there are multiple methodologies and I'd love to get input on how you would approach a problem like this:

Let's say I have a survey of 100 questions. I give this survey as a pilot to 50 respondents. My end goal is to reduce the number of questions asked of a single responder by creating multiple versions of this survey (so, for example, we might split the survey questions in half for an A version and a B version, and ask only A or B to a given responder). To do this, I can use the relationships found between questions/responses in the pilot survey. I'd also like to use these relationships to come up with a good way of predicting any unasked questions (so, if a responder got version A, I'd like to be able to predict/impute how they would have responded to every question in version B). Note that the # of questions to reduce isn't set, so reducing fewer questions is okay, you can assume that there are no missing values, and all of the responses are on a likert scale of 1-7. 

How would you approach a problem like this? What methods would you use? How would you assess how well you've made the split and predictions?

As background, in my first run-through on this, I split the questions in half (randomly), and using a linear model to predict the response to each question given the responder's answers to all other questions in their version of the survey. I compared multiple splits on multiple population with the goal of minimizing the MSE of the models. I know there are varying philosophies on how to treat Likert scale data, so if you have alternatives that better accommodate that data type, I'd love to hear about those too."

A bit of a wall of text, but hopefully someone can steer me in the right direction!",4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1484023281,True,"Sorry for the wall of text. I have a lot of questions in my mind. I've Googled the hell out of these questions, but I am just overwhelmed by noise and BS out there trying to 'sell' data-science as if it's the next Pepsi flavor.

-----------------------------------



**My Background:** 

* I work in advertising, specifically social media
* About 5-6ish years experience
* I manage one employee, looking to add another over the next few months as workload is increasing
* Undergrad was BA in Business Administration (the most math I learned was business calc and I barely remember anything...if anything).
* Very familiar with web design related code (HTML, CSS, but that's about it). Taught myself, so I'm pretty adept to the thinking...just need to know where to apply it next.
* My job (without saying the exact title) is along the lines of comparing social conversation data to brand social page data, social ad spend data, and any other data to draw insights from.
*Among others, I currently have access to Brandwatch (agency just signed a huge contract with them so I need to take full advantage. working with another analyst in the agency on using their API, SDK, etc to make dashboards...but that's all him) which is my daily tool for working.
* **I don't plan to relocate or find work elsewhere for learning. I have a job I love, and it's growing in responsibility and complexity. To reap the rewards for how I've been growing the role, I need to show a long-term curve for advancing it, using data in more complex ways to make better insights.**

**My Problem:**

* I'm reaching an impasse in my abilities; I feel that I can do much more with more advanced techniques (i.e. code) but I don't know how or what.
* I need to up my game because right now it's a matter of workload vs. staffing vs. time. I need to be able to manage mine and my employee's time more efficiently so we can spend less time wrestling Excel or Powerpoint, and more time drawing insights from the data.

**My Thoughts:**

* I've been considering getting my 'graduate level' education in Data Science
* I have no clue where to begin
* I have no clue what programming language would benefit my situation / team best (don't want to waste time / effort learning something I don't need)
* I've explored a lot of options on Coursera, Udacity, you name it. None are standing out to me as ""START HERE!"" they just all look like they want my money.

**My Questions:**

* Given the above, what do I begin learning to advance my role?
* What programming language do I start learning?
* What are the benefits to learning the programming languages associated with so-called 'data science'? How does learning any of this **specifically** help me? 
* What tools / platforms / etc can I get my hands on right now at a free or low cost that I can start tinkering with the huge data sets I have access to now? (i.e. code editors? no idea...)
* Without having to spend $20k on an entire graduate degree (I have way too much debt to go back to school. My best bet is to stay working and learn what I can), what paths or sequence of courses should I start taking? Links appreciated."

First year maths students - which 3 books ?,10,0,False,False,False,datascience,1484229391,True,"


I'm currently on the first year of a maths degree (mature student) at a non russel group
university in the UK (the russel group unis are the better ones). Realistically
I'm probably only going to be able to get through around 3 books before I finish
University.

### So - could you suggest me three books that would be the best foundation for your job, why you suggest them and say what your job is?

I have interests in maths, programming, visuals... but it's probably easier to
read through and apply that to myself than others trying to guess what
would suit me too accurately.

I was planning to go through Spivaks Calculus and some Abstract Algebra, but I'm
thinking that other sources might be more appropriate. (these would have been
more suitable if I was still going to go into teaching I think). I know some really good resources for 
maths but for data related stuff, stats, etc.... I'm not too sure. 

I wouldn't imagine that Real Analysis, Abstract algebra are that relevant to
data focussed jobs in general. In comparison to stats and comp sci at least.

I've heard Think Stats is good, and I've used some python so perhaps that would
be something. 

cheers!!

Spend money on personal hardware or buy time in the cloud?,5,1,False,False,False,datascience,1484338678,True,"I'm trying to find a good desktop machine for data science. I've done a ton of research on the topic, so I generally know the bare minimum of what I need: quad-core Core i7 (or Xeon?), 256 GB SSD, and 16 GB. That is fairly easy to find. I've also read that for deep learning and other machine learning methods it's nice to have a GeForce GPU. (I haven't worked with these methods myself, but I'm trying to future-proof myself with this purchase.) My budget is $1,000-$1,200, so it will be hard to fit all of this in, especially the GPU. This all gets to the question of whether I should just go with the quad-core processor, SSD, and 16 GB of RAM setup and spin up AWS and EC2 instances to handle the rest (I currently have no experience doing this, I've just read about it on this sub and elsewhere)? Is that probably the most cost-effective option? Should I just learn how to do that anyway since it's a marketable skill? Is there anything else I need in terms of hardware?

My experience thus far is pulling relatively small datasets using SQL and working with them in R. However, as we all know, data science is about lifelong learning, and I want to keep pushing forward as a data scientist and work with larger datasets and more advanced technologies. In purchasing a machine, I don't want to make a decision that will hinder that in the future.

I've read a lot about what I need but at this point I'm overwhelmed, and everyone has different needs so I'm hoping to get some advice based on where I am as a data scientist.

How to pass sparse matrix (numpy array) to Keras?,2,3,False,False,False,datascience,1484466910,True,"[SOLVED - see comments below for how I solved it]

Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I go. 

Keras - the Python library for deep learning. I just started using it, and I'm confused by one issue that I keep having.

So I'm working with a somewhat large dataset - 1.5mil rows. It's text data, after passing it through tfidfvectorizer in scikit-learn, and afterwards dimensionality reduction with random projections, I end up with a 1.5mil x 500 dimension matrix, a very sparse matrix. 

	<1483700x500 sparse matrix of type '<type 'numpy.float64'>'
		with 22120738 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

I was trying to pass this into Keras `model.fit` but apparently it doesn't accept this datatype. When I try `.toarray()` on it, I get a memory error (it's just too huge) so I tried instead to train on batches of my data (500 rows at a time) so it would be something like

    model.train_on_batch(X_train[0:500].toarray(), y_train[0:500])

My question is, am I doing it right? I mean, is this the only way I can train on this dataset or is there a way to shove a sparse matrix type (compressed sparse rows types to be more precise) into the fit method?

On this note, is there a way to pass this type of matrix into sklearn's PCA (or truncated svd?) too? I get sparsity errors in that situation which made me choose random projections instead of PCA. 

Thanks a bunch. "

Looking for guidance: training neural net with some features missing,1,3,False,False,False,datascience,1484469338,True,"Hi guys,

Imagine a data set where most features are there all the time, but a few are missing for 90% - 95% of records. The complete records are too few to train a neural network, so you want to make use of the data with missing features. 

Maybe a model can be first trained using only the *features* that are always present, and then trained further a few iterations on data augmented with the rest of the features. 

In the coming *days* I aim to obtain some experimental results as a sort of proof-of-concept that such an approach is possible. I would like to hear any of your thoughts on this matter so I can get going in the right direction straight away and get some valuable results. Thanks for reading and for your time!"

A bit about me

Towards the end of my first year in college, i realized the most useful thing i was learning was stats 101(well, and game theory) and ended up loading up as much stats related courses as i could, started learning R and will probably take up python as soon as i get comfortable in R.  I've also scratched the surface of graph theory and will continue once i'm done with my exams. I found about the whole field of big data while looking for applications of the skillset I'm trying to build but it turns out the barriers to entry are high and being a non stats/CS undergrad, I've got an uphill battle to fight.
I also have applied mathematical techniques in economics (mostly linear algebra/multivariate calculus), but i dont know if thats relevant."

Seeking advice on grad school to pursue a career in data science,4,5,False,False,False,datascience,1484506679,True,"I'm a recent college grad looking to further my education with the goal of breaking into a career in data science. I'll provide some perspective on my current situation:

I Did my undergrad at University of Portland, majoring in Operations and Technology Management, with the following being the most relevant coursework:

* Optimization
* Programming and Simulation in R
* Business Analytics
* Database Management
* System Analysis & Design

After graduating in December with a GPA of 3.7, I started a full time position as a Data Reporting Analyst immediately after. Additionally, I have intermediate/semi advanced experience with R, VBA, and SQL, and I've been learning Python for about a month now. I fill my free time with tackling side projects I create myself that focus on skills I currently don't posses (like machine learning). 

Lastly, I've currently started taking Calc. 1 at my local state school, with plans to continue into Calc. 2, linear algebra, and higher level stats to fill my gap in classical math skills.

My first question is **Where do I go from here, which schools/programs should I be considering, and is admission attainable with my background?**

The graduate programs I've been eyeing lately include:

* NYU's Data Science MS
* University of Washington's Data Science MS
* Caltech's Ph.D in Applied + Computational Mathematics
* University of Washington's MS in Applied Mathematics
* Michigan's MS in Applied Statistics
* Graduate programs in Operations Research

After perusing though this subreddit for the past few months, I believe the popular opinion is that data science masters are worth relatively little compared to a MS in math or statistics. While I would prefer to go to grad school in something more traditional like math or stats, my concerns lie in my background, even though I know I would succeed in those programs. 

My second question is **What is your guys' opinions on Operations Research graduate programs?**

With my background being in Ops. & Tech. Mgmt, would I be better off pursuing an OR degree? I know that both Columbia and MIT offer grad degrees in OR, but I am uncertain that I would even have a shot at getting admitted there. 

I know I am on the right track, I guess I just need some guidance in terms of understanding what is achievable for being admitted to a grad school given my background. "
What are some of the differences between a data scientist and a statistician?,28,39,False,False,False,datascience,1484508175,True,"Hi there,

I'm a 27 year old male form the UK looking for a complete change of career into data science/statistics. 

Basically I need to get some qualifications. There is a suitable 'conversion course' of sorts in data science. The alternative is to basically go down a lengthy process of an undergraduate degree in stats and then a postgraduate in stats. It would take me half the amount of time and be considerably cheaper if I was to go down the data science route.

My only concern is that I wouldn't be as qualified if I did the conversion course rather than the stats course. 

Basically my question is what are the main differences between data science and stats? The differences seem to be pretty unclear from what I've read. Are statisticians generally more qualified than data scientists, can they command a higher wage etc?

Thanks guys"

What are the most effective ways to learn that have worked for you specifically?,3,12,False,False,False,datascience,1484764675,True,"Hi everyone, 

I am fairly low on the data science totem pole (good at excel, so so at R and very much a beginner at Python). I am working on developing my skills, but with such an abundance of resources out there I was wondering what worked for you. Basically I want to do some meta learning. 

I am reading a few books to develop my skills in Python and R, as well as a machine learning book to provide ideas with how to use them. I was planning to look into specific case studies soon. I have tried some coursera and EdX classes, but so far those haven't aligned with my particular projects.

I don't necessarily want specific resources from you guys, but rather what processes you used to develop. For example: I started with an applied book to get the basics down, then I read a case study to get deeper into how I could specifically use the tools, then I read a theory book to really understand what I was doing and how I could do it better. Something like that. Any and all replies are appreciated!"

General industry experience or novel project success: which is more important for building a career?,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1484830772,True,"This is sort of a job question thread, but the thread seems to have been largely ignored for 3 weeks so I figured I'd have better success posting a new self post. 

I am a recent (1 year ago) PhD graduate from Physics (experimental, condensed matter) who has spent the last year working on my own start-up and in general staying up to date with the machine learning community and publications. I'm not sure the best way to continue from here towards building a career and figured it would be best to just ask. 

My startup was based around a lot of natural language processing applied to scientific abstracts and data. However, because of the nature of startups (And doing it alone) I ended up spending some 95% of my time working on full-stack development (hosted a site on AWS with a full data pipeline, sql, message brokers, ec2 cluster scaling, etc.).

Other experience I have directly in data science come from my self-study of machine learning in general (learning the wide variety of techniques and tools available), and more recently (past 2 years) teaching and mentoring of many of my friends and colleagues in data science (some of whom have jobs doing data science now). 

During my PhD I also did work in CUDA and am working on getting a patent on this for some largely parallel real-time data processing tools I created. 

For my PhD in general, I worked largely and mostly in analyzing and modeling a specific type of 4D data sets, traveled around the world taking data and organizing it, and everywhere I went, automating scientific equipment (I don't like turning a knob when I can get the computer to do it). 

For my undergrad I got a double degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering, with some research experience in cognitive and adaptive radio (which is somewhat related to the larger goal of getting into machine learning and data science).

All in all, I consider myself to be ready to take on almost any challenge in data science, but I am frankly a bit worried that I will be left bored and frustrated with whatever job I get if I just apply and accept whatever job offers the most income. From my friends in the field and my own experience, it seems like the meat of the work is usually just data-pipelines, scripts for data visualization, and full-stack style development: and frankly I want to avoid these things and focus on more challenging and engaging machine learning problems. 

***TL;DR*** This brings me to my final question: should I be focused on trying to just get any job, even if it isn't doing novel data science like I would like and try to build a name for myself in the community, and likely hop between jobs until I find something that fits me personally? Or, should I instead invest my time in doing direct data science myself (prototyping new architectures and bench-marking them, etc.), working on kaggles and making my attempts and code public, trying to gain notoriety that way through the scientific side? At the end of the day, the dream is to work at a company like DeepMind or OpenAI, but I recognize that my resume just isn't quite up to snuff yet and I'm wondering where I should go from here to make that happen. 

Thank you for any input you may have."

I studied Comp Sci and Statistics and I have done a fair bit of kaggle in the past so when I got the chance to work as a junior data scientist at a small start up 6 months ago i lept at the chance.


But now that I am working on my own with nobody to fall back on or learn from I am finding it really hard.

I feel like a bit of a sham and now I am expected to build all these fancy models and I just don't feel like I have enough experience.

I think I have gotten by for so long because I can write SQL and do some automation in Python and been building some dashboards and reports but very little actual data science.

Leaving a Position Before 1 Year Anniversary,3,2,False,False,False,datascience,1484930169,True,"Do any hiring managers on here have opinions about people leaving a role before their 1 year anniversary? Or any Data Scientists want to share their story about this?

I've been with a start up for about 6 months now and the role has been entirely not as advertised since day one. I'm spending about 90% of my time in sales calls when I was hired as a data scientist. Additionally, work life balance was pitched as everyone working no more than 40 hrs/week, but I almost never work less than 50.  I know that isn't criminal, but the hard sell on the hours was a reason I took the job.

At this point I fear my skills are going soft and I'll have a hard time finding something else if I don't act soon. There's no sign of me getting to move to a more data-focused role in the foreseeable future.

Hoping to get some advice on the value of getting a MS in Data Science for someone who already has a MA in Economics,6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1484958969,True,"Howdy r/datascience, I apologize in advance for another career advice question but this is a great community and I was hoping to get some insight. I'm trying to transition to a career in data science or something closely resembling it and I'm debating the merits of going back to school to help fill up the gaps in my skills/education.

A little context, I currently have a master's degree in economics and work for a company building and implementing economic models. In both my education and current job I have a lot of experience with econometric techniques and working with data more generally. In undergad/grad school I used STATA and for the past year or so I have been learning R through coursera, datacamp, textbooks,  youtube videos and some personal projects. 

I have learned a ton over the last year but I still feel like I am very far away from being competitive for a datascience job opening. I currently don't have any real experience working with SQL, but other than that I think I have the appropriate skill set to work as a data analyst at some level. 

With my econ background I am relatively comfortable with statistics and many of the machine learning concepts but what I truly lack is skills/knowledge/experience relating to computer science. Outside of R, and some really entry level python tutorials/videos, I don't have any programming experience or skills. I am currently mulling over options regarding going back to school and I was hoping to get some input from r/datascience. 

I am very intrigued by some of the master programs specifically for data science, like Cal Berekely's and the University of Washington's program. I know that these types of programs are newer and there isn't a strong consensus on how their graduates do in industry. I have also thought about doing a bootcamp program but again don't know if it would be optimal given my current skill set. My third option would be doing some sort of post-bac or certificate program solely in computer science to help with my biggest weakness. 

Other factors at play, I have strong grades/test scores/work experience/references so I do think I would be competitive for some of the MS Data Science programs. I also don't have any existing student loans or debt, so while it is still a sizable investment I have some financial flexibility in going back to school. I also really love school and learning, and it has been frustrating trying to self-teach myself so much while still working full time. 

Has anyone here successfully transitioned from a traditional economics background to a datascience career? My end goal is to work at the intersection of politics/public policy and datascience. Either working for the government to harness data for better policy design and outcomes, or to work in political consulting on the analytics side. Any thoughts, advice, or tips would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR** Have MA Economics and work in economic modeling but looking to make the transition to a career in datascience. Thoughts on marginal benefit for an additional masters degree in data science or data science bootcamp for someone with solid stats/analysis background but very weak programming/production/CS?"

Help needed - is this study double-blinded or triple-blinded?,3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1485024482,True,"Hi everyone!
I'm trying to figure out if a particular study is double-blinded or triple-blinded. I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to ask this, but among the ones I've seen, you guys seem to be among the most helpful and knowledgeable on this subject. The study in question is this one: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423791

Just in case you can't read the whole thing, here's the part that is puzzling me:

*""A randomized controlled design with repeated measures was adopted in this study. A total of 118 participants were recruited from May to December 2014 at cardiac inpatient wards in one hospital in Chengdu. The cardiac nurses identified the potential eligible participants via in-person interview. Eligible participants were randomly allocated into either the experimental or the control group prior to discharge by means of computer-generated random numbers by the researcher. Allocation concealment was achieved by enclosing assignments in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. Participants in the control group received usual care only, while participants in the experimental group received usual care plus the 3-month multidisciplinary supportive program. The usual care was health education about heart failure provided by nurses during the hospitalization and at discharge. In addition, information and consultation about heart failure were available on the ward during the hospitalization.""*

Now I know that both the participants and the independent data collectors were blinded, so it's at least a double-blinded study, right? However, I don't know if the researcher who made the randomisation is blinded. If a study speaks of allocation concealment, does it necessarily mean that the researcher is blinded? And if not, since the study doesn't say who gave out the envelopes to the patients, how can I be sure if it is double-blinded or triple-blinded?

I'm a psychology grad student who has been trying to gear myself up for an eventual job in data science. One of the tools in my research toolbox has been structural equation modeling, and I was wondering if there have been similar approaches developed to use more complex nonlinear algorithms that are common in machine learning. It seems in theory like the paths in an SEM could reasonably be replaced with something like an SVM or neural network, allowing for more complex nonlinear designs that include latent variables.

I know that with SEM the objective is primarily to estimate the model parameters, whereas with machine learning the objective usually prediction accuracy. I'm just curious whether anyone has merged the two, or if that's just not even a worthwhile task."

I have a project this year and need to develop some goals and use cases. 

My first two are required, they involved developing a machine learning algorithm to determine overall IT risk (from an availability standpoint) based on incidents, outages, etc.. The other is going to be extended analysis on log aggregation. 

I want to develop at least 2-3 more, so I thought I'd post something here to see if anyone had any good suggestion. What are, in your opinions, some good IT problems to solve using Machine Learning and Data Science tools? Thanks so much for any input!"
My plan for transitioning into Data Science within the Marketing Field,16,3,False,False,False,datascience,1485200221,True,"Hey all, I am considering a career shift into data scientist in respect to digital advertising/marketing. Like many others, I am struggling to map a path forward that will enable me to reach my goal in the most efficient way possible. I also want to know the feasibility of my goals here since I do not have a real math or stats background.

**My background:** 32 years old with ~8 years' experience in the advertising & marketing field. I started as a copywriter and transitioned into digital ad campaign management before becoming a marketing manager for a digital advertising agency. I am intrigued by big data and its impact on market intelligence and targeting. I live in a country in the Persian Gulf with no Data Science scene, but plan on relocating in about a years' time (probably back to the US, but perhaps Dubai) where I can network with people in the field.

I hold a BA in Communication (ie Mass Comm) and an MBA. I was exposed to stats through a masters' level class and while conducting my thesis. I learned how to use SPSS, clean & transform data, run parametric tests on my data and interpret the results, although it took me a while to grasp the concepts. As far as programing is concerned, back in college I created HTML/CSS websites for fun and took a Visual Basic programming class.

At this point I already have some pretty strong domain knowledge but my stats understanding is basic and I have to start learning new programing languages. I always struggled with math, but can get to the required level of understanding if I put in the effort.

Since I would like to remain in the marketing field, I am looking at the following path forward:

1) Master Google Analytics

2) Master Statistics & Probability

3) Learn Python, SQL and R (Should I learn all 3?)

4) Participate in real-life projects to get practical experience, either at my job or on the side 

5) Quit my job to relocate 

5) Join a bootcamp in the US or EU to further strengthen my skills and make contacts

6) Look for a Data Science job 


Does this sound like a realistic plan to you? Am I missing or underestimating anything? Does it matter whether I start learning programing or stats first?

Thanks!"

"What are ""exploratory"" ML techniques to use when confronted with a new dataset (and you know little about it)?",26,34,False,False,False,datascience,1485300868,True,"I have dataset in dataframe form, shaped (2700, 155). Out of the 155 columns, only 4 are categorical values; the others are measurements. 

What are some ""exploratory"" ML techniques to use when confronted with a dataset which you know little about? My mind races to t-SNE, or perhaps types of classification. 

What other methods could I use to see ""what's there"" and help give me some direction?"
"Given a t-SNE plot, how can I infer the ""most correct"" labels? How does one understand its structure?",0,2,False,False,False,datascience,1485316552,True,"Let's say I begin with an exceptionally large dataframe (e.g. imported/munged from tsv files). Several of these columns are categorical labels. 

(As a more concrete example, let's imagine a group of students in a school district, pre-school to high-school). 

Now, I begin using sklearn and instantiate a t-SNE model, similar to the example here:

http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html

     import numpy as np
     from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
     X  # my data
     model = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=0)
     np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)
     model.fit_transform(X) 

and then we plot this. The plot might look something like this: http://imgur.com/a/3amkJ

Here's my problem: with real datasets, after using t-sne to learn/cluster, you will have a number of ""clusters"". Then, using the categorical labels, I try to go through each of these, and try to figure out what structure the t-SNE plot is giving me. 

For our school example, I'd get the t-SNE output, then I would label the datapoints. (Let's assume that the clusters are actually representative of age/classroom, e.g. the first-graders group together, the second-graders are a group, etc.)

If I try to color this plot with ""grades"", I'll see that the grades does not really explain the structure of this plot. (Why? Because every class-level has students with As, Bs, Cs, etc.) Then I might try height...that does pretty good (because there's a correlation between short students--> pre-school, tall students --> high school seniors). 

How does one use a t-SNE plot to infer the ""most correct"" labels of the data? How does one use t-SNE plots to explain (and further explore) the plot structure?

thoughts on continuing education degrees in data science areas / online degrees?,1,5,False,False,False,datascience,1485333307,True,"this popped up in my facebook, not the first time i've seen something similar - http://analytics.villanova.edu/lpppc-msa/?Access_Code=VIL-MSA-FACEBOOK&kwd=lookalikeleads1_desktop-ny2&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=lookalikeleads1_desktop-ny2

i'm wondering if anyone has done any of these programs, thoughts on them, which are good/better, if they are worth the effort or if private study/projects/etc is just as good, etc.

me: comp sci degree, 2001, mid tier school, decent math and programming, both of which have atrophied through disuse.  i primarily do data related activities which i am pretty strong at.  data modeling, performance optimization, processing algorithms, etc.  i work on essentially a baby supercomputer (netezza) and have terabytes of various data.

i can run R inside the machine, and run some algos it has available inside it (geospatial, linear regression, k-means clustering) as well have SAS (EG) to connect to it - however i have no project or need of these tools.  the SAS userbase primarily actually uses SAS for ETL and straightforward reporting, very little if anything SAS/stats/model specific it seems.  although i have the tools, i don't have the use case or a project to learn.

my math brain has faded since college.  i don't mind spinning it up some more but i'm much more interested in being able to practically apply some things rather than really get deep and dirty in the math weeds.  if there's some fringe area where a phd in math can get a few percentage points lift more out of something, great - i'd like to pass what i build to them, not learn to be them.

although i can name the algos above, i don't know how/when to apply them, or tweak them, etc.  i'm dangerous in a database and naive on this type of analysis.  so my goal in the classes, or something else, would be to become dangerous on both.  if i go a schooling route, i'd like to do so online.  i would hope a program to be light on fluff and all on real examples and work to make me smarter, with enough balance on home life that it wouldn't be too burdensome to keep up with.

appreciate any thoughts on the matter.  thanks!

I was hopeing for some input from you all.

I want to build an entire pipeline from datasource to internal dashboard (or just a monitoring report).

I would set up something to automatically start a python script, which will run hadoop jobs, to preaggregate some data to fit into local memory. Then calculations for KPIs will be done and graphs will be made.     My plan is to do this with plotly/jupyter so
I can output an html and have that been the internal dashboard?  

I dont really know what I'm doing with dashboards, and I dont even know if this *is* and dashboard - as I dont want users to requery anything, just look through interactive plots. But my wheelhouse is Hive/Python/Bash.     

Is there a better way to do this? or can anyone recommend anything that would help? have exeperience with this sort of thing?

Thanks so much!"

Experimental design beyond A/B testing,7,3,False,False,False,datascience,1485663462,True,"I am trying to find suggestions for different approaches to running tests when it isn't possible to randomly assign users to test and control buckets.

For example, if I own 10 shops and have a certain algorithm that I use to price items, and perhaps I want to test a new algorithm that would result in price changes. There are a few approaches I can see but it isn't clear to me if I'm missing others and would love to hear more.

**Standard A/B testing:**

If I were to randomly assign shoppers to test or control buckets then this would obviously be a bad experience for them (given that prices are visible).

**Switchback experiment:**

Perhaps instead I decide to run a switchback experiment, in which the control pricing algorithm runs for 6 hours, then the test pricing algorithm, runs for 6 hours, and so on throughout my test period. This is obviously better than the standard A/B approach but I feel like it still has problems (ie what if the price change results in a change to long term customer behavior but it takes some time for the behavior to change - perhaps the switchback wouldn't capture this).

**Causal Impact approach:**

Another approach might be to use a [Causal Impact](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html) style analysis, in which I set certain shops as 'control' shops, and other shops as 'test' shops, and then change the algorithm at the test shops and analyze my metric of interest, where we look for a causal effect in the time series at the test shops with respect to the control shops. The drawback here is that you seem highly dependent on how well the controls represent the test shops.

Does anyone have any other suggestions, or even somewhere I can read more about different experimental setups, beyond A/B testing?"

Whether the loan repaid early

Whether the loan repaid late

Whether the loan was impaired

Property tenure (Freehold or Leasehold)

Borrower

Broker introducer

Broker fee %

Solicitor used

Term

LTV

 I offer myself to the sub reddit for any insight or guidance into techniques or tips into how best identify meaniningful relationship with the data, and put them into pretty graphs so management can see them.

I plan to use Python/Pandas but any advice on libraries or specific functions or techniques most welcome.

Is MATLAB worth it?,10,7,False,False,False,datascience,1485811228,True,I'm currently in an undergrad class (Numerical Linear Algebra/Matrix Methods Data Analysis) and the assignments/projects we are going to be assigned throughout the semester are out of a MATLAB textbook. Although the class is taught using MATLAB the professor has given us the choice to use other rapid prototyping environments such as Python. My question is would it be better for me pursuing Data Science to learn how to do the problems in Python or should I just do it through MATLAB which overall would probably be easier since our textbook problems are based off using MATLAB? As of right now I would say I'm somewhere between novice and intermediate with Python since I did have a course last semester that we exclusively used Python for data analysis and visualization.

* Competent in: Java, MATLAB, Python (through Coursera courses), R, C.
* Am currently learning (this semester): Scheme, Haskell, Stata and SQL (through Stanford Lagunita).
* Completed one semester-long class project with R that implements ggplot2 and single-variable regression.

* Will also begin a semester-long class project with Stata that is similar to those two described above.
* Coursework in: multivariate calculus, combinatorics, linear algebra and basic statistics.
* Currently enrolled in: declarative programming (Scheme, Haskell), numerical computing (MATLAB). 
* Strong with public speaking/communication (working on an advanced manual in my Toastmasters club and have even won speaking competitions in my city).

"Data Science degree programs, saturation, red ocean...?",9,24,False,False,False,datascience,1485841880,True,"Hope I am wrong, but I keep thinking that there is a high chance that there's too much saturation in people graduating with Data Science related degrees.  I've been considering a master's in DS, but I am seriously rethinking this option.  For one, big data education is one of the most searched terms in India; hence, it isn't a bubble that's exclusive to the U.S.  Having worked as a financial advisor (Merrill Lynch) in my previous job, I can't help but get nervous about Big Data in terms of the amount of fish in the small pond (a classic red ocean).  Many of these graduate degrees generally can be completed in a year for a full-time student--which means, the barrier to entry is quite low.  Also, when you look at MBA degrees, Analytics degrees, Data Science, Computer Science etc., many overlap in terms of concentration in big data...  

I think for those who do seek DS education, they should already be employed and have knowledge/skills within their respective industry.  For example, an RN deciding to get a DS grad degree or a network engineer in telecom deciding to do the same etc.  With such a high saturation and low barrier to entry, I really think these 1 year DS grad programs are cash cows for universities but for the grads, I think the realities once they graduate will be a lot different than what they were hoping for.  

Now an argument could be made on these points.  For example, I work for a large telco.  They are trying to be a ""data driven"" org. and when we pursue DS education, it doesn't mean that it will lead to a job in big data.  It just means that such education would help with being more analytical as a leader.  So I get this, and it falls in-line with the point I made above about already having industry knowledge and skills and DS education serving as additional skills set.    

The bottom line is to not be swayed by what everyone else is doing or what the media says is the ""sexy job"", because usually, by the time the good word gets to all of us it's usually too late and the cyclical trend is on the way down.  Based on what I look for--which are barrier to entry and whether it's a red/blue ocean, I would be cautious about anything in analytics especially for people who don't have their main industry skill set (such as those graduating from college without much work experience)...  Even if you work at Starbucks, whoa, it would be a great idea to go from barista to DS, but the questions is... how many DS'tists do Starbucks need?  And do they already have a bunch?"

"Need help fine-tuning a simulation I am trying to run on R, solving the ""100-sided dice problem""",2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1485878428,True,"I am currently trying to simulate [this problem](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/465651/expected-value-of-game-involving-100-sided-die/465668). I am using R.

The strategy that I am using is, roll till an ""a"" or a larger value is encountered, in which case, stop playing and collect your winnings. 

This is simulated 1000 times, for each value of ""a"" (which varies from 1 to 100), by using the replicate function. I maintain records of what value of ""a"" gave rise to what expected value.

Finally, I choose the entry for the maximum expected value.

To provide an example:

1) 100-sided dice

2) a = data.frame(a = 1:100)

3) For each value of a, I run a simulation to check what the estimated value will be. One example: a = 30; die rolls = 23, 22, 2, 12, 38... In this case, the player continues to roll till 38, at which point, they stop (as 38 is larger than ""a"" here) and collect $38 as their winnings. Actual gain = $38 - $4 = $34

4) Step 3 is repeated 1000 times (each value of ""a"" gets 1000 runs). The final expected value chosen is the mean of all these 1000 runs

5) I end up with a data frame like: 
    a = data.frame(a = 1:100, ev = c(50.5, 51.6, 52... 12.2, 10.93)) 
from which I can see that the maximal expected value is 87.xyz where xyz is the decimal part.

The problem that I am facing is that **I cannot seem to be able to replicate the 87.3571 figure** in the original link (which is backed up by the theoretical calculation)...

I have noted that increasing the number of trials from 1000 to 10,000 towards 100,000 takes the expected value closer to the figure in the link. Is this the only way to increase accuracy or am I overlooking something?

Some other information:

1) I set.seed to a fixed number at the beginning of the function. This means that set.seed is called only once for the entire function (irrespective of number of trials)."

Transitioning to data science from cognitive neuroscience. Advice needed!,0,0,False,False,False,datascience,1485913681,True,"Hi all,

I am in the final year of my PhD in cognitive neuroscience (US), and am interested in turning my career sights to fields such as data science (rather than academia). This motivation has grown since learning that I will be relocating to a major city in the Pacific Northwest that has many opportunities for careers in data science. 

I have skills in research methods, statistics, data analysis/visualization, working with EEG and eye tracking, programming (SPSS, Matlab, R, Python; however, I'm not the best programmer), and some machine learning. Based on what I've seen in recent data science postings in my future city of residence, it looks like there's a fair bit of overlap between my current skills and what they're looking for. Some positions additionally look for things like experience with SQL/databases, C++, more rigorous machine learning experience, etc.

Has anyone here successfully transitioned from neuroscience/cognitive neuroscience to data science? If so, how much ""catching up"" did you need to do, skill-wise? Do you have any suggestions regarding resources to accomplish thus supplemental learning?

Does anyone else have any general tips on what I should be focusing on in order to be competitive in data science? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

R: My STAT classes usually require us to use R. I personally love R, as it's my tool of choice early in my undergrad career.

Python: So I've heard that Python is on the up and up for Data Science, and may soon overtake R. Do you guys think this is true, and what are your thoughts on Python vs R?

SQL: So I've kind of had some exposure to MySQL, and created some basic tables and queries. But may I ask, what's the difference between Excel and MySQL exactly? I feel as if Excel does more, so if that's the case, why is SQL such a big deal in data science?

I've had one job in retail and one job as a data entry assistant. Do you guys have any tips on how to get started in this field? Should i be looking more for part-time jobs or internships, and if so which ones exactly (like ""Business analyst"", ""Summer Analyst"" etc...)?

The confusing messages about the data science career,88,131,False,False,False,datascience,1486149720,True,"Speaking as someone with a PhD in a quantitative field who'd like to become a data scientist (at least, I think I'd like to do that), it has been a challenge to figure out what the data science career is all about and especially how to get into it. I think I'm a pretty smart, discerning person, but the things I've read and heard about this career are, as a whole, so confusing and so contradictory it's hard to know what to think.

Several months ago, after doing some research, I thought this was a viable path for me and that I had a plan to get into the field. Today, I don't know whether any of the things I believed about this career months ago are true, whether it's realistic for me to get a data science position in the near future, or whether this is a career I would even want.

I thought I'd list paraphrased version of some of the confusing and often contradictory things I've read and heard about this career for your amusement. If anyone has thoughts, by all means please comment, although at this point I don't think I'll believe anything anyone says about this stuff without experiencing it firsthand.

* Data science is a viable career path for people without a strong technical background who are willing to take a couple online courses.

* It's very straightforward to get a data scientist position if you have an advanced degree in any quantitative field, especially if you can code.

* It's almost impossible to get a data scientist position right out of (grad) school. No matter what field your degree was in, you probably need to spend a couple years working as a data analyst or BI person to get some domain expertise.

* Data science is a field with a serious talent shortage; companies are desperate for anyone who's at all qualified.

* The data science job market is flooded with applicants; any open job is going to get dozens if not hundreds of reasonably qualified applicants. It's really hard to get a job unless you seriously stand out. 

* The technical skills are the least important aspect. It's more important to work well with people and be a good communicator. You can easily learn the technical aspects on the job.

* A data scientist just needs to know more statistics than a programmer and more coding than a statistician.

* A data scientist needs to know all about optimization, numerical analysis, algorithms and data structures, and lots of advanced machine learning and statistics.

* The only things you really have to know are the fundamentals: be able to write some code in Python and R and know about confidence intervals and linear regression.

* In order to appeal to employers, it's crucial to have experience with the *exact technologies* the employer uses. If they use Hadoop, you must know Hadoop. Etc.

* There's no way to be a data scientist without knowing some pretty advanced math.

* Math isn't really relevant for data science in practice, and some of the most successful data scientists I know don't even know calculus.

* Data scientists spend their time working on intellectually challenging problems that are just as interesting as those in academia.

* Data scientists spend most of their time on boring data munging issues, usually with an ultimate goal of selling more shoes or some other horrible marketing thing.

* The data science field is really hot and will surely continue to grow for many years to come.

* Data science has hit its peak; it will continue to be useful in its areas of legitimate application, but companies are realizing it was oversold and they will be cutting back.

* There is an amazing amount of value to be had in data science.

* Most data scientists contribute nothing worthwhile to their employers.

* You must have a portfolio of projects to show employers.

* I don't know any data scientists with a portfolio of projects; my coworkers and I think that's a waste of time.

Here's another discouraging thing: looking at job ads for data scientist positions, there is such a crazy variety of skills and experience desired for each position. While I know that ""Required skills"" aren't always really required, it's pretty bewildering when:

* one position says you must have NLP experience;

* one says you must have cybersecurity experience;

* one says you must have Javascript and web programming experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience in the health care industry;

* one says you must have retail marketing experience;

* one says you must have bioinformatics experience;

* one says you must have experience in the intelligence community;

* one says you must have Django experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience with the Microsoft products SSMS, SSAS, and SSRS;

* one says you must know SAS;

* one says you must have experience in financial analysis.

In the above list, when I listed specific technologies, it was because they seem somewhat outside the standard data science toolkit, as far as I know. But even when they mention ""mainstream"" technologies, they vary so much between the different positions, and there is such a massive list. Different ones want AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, PostgreSQL, MySQL, D3, Tableau, MapReduce, Flink, Mahout, MongoDB, Cassandra, and many more.

Judging by the ads, there is probably hardly anyone in the world who is qualified for more than one of these positions... and yet they are all ""data scientist"" positions.

Actually, I think half these employers just copy & pasted a bunch of buzzwords into their ads, but that's depressing for another reason."

Why does a Data Scientist need a unix computer?,48,17,False,False,False,datascience,1486263967,True,"**I need help *making* this argument, I don't need to be convinced myself.**

Right now my team is having trouble with our Linux boxes because our IT dept isn't used to supporting linux (our team switched last summer), and we're the oddballs in the company now. A handful of sys admins use linux, but they don't get ""support"" from tech, they are local admins for their machines (something our CTO doesn't want to do). 

In one conversation I had with the CTO he suggested it *might* make sense to switch us to OSX if we still wanted a Unix core, but that I'd have to work on the justification.

Could folks here help me work out the details about *why* we want a Unix box? 

The rough examples I have are things like:

*  easier to get Py packages to install\*, especially higher level scientific computing ones (Numpy, sklearn)

* command line tools make it easy to poke at big data sets

* our servers are linux so getting used to using command line stuff locally helps us push work to servers

* minor conveniences like having a terminal window that can resize and allow tabs (both things Windows 7 doesn't allow) make it a lot easier to move around files, or drop into R / Python and get back to what we're doing. 

Are there other arguments I should be making?

note on installing packages. Our sys team wasn't familiar with Anaconda and I think did a wonky install of it on a Windows machine. They installed it but it appeared I still needed some admin rights to use conda to create environments and then install packages into those environments. 

Further, the idea of installing and using a lot of Python modules seems like it's a much different way of doing things from our developers, so the idea of a package manager that makes that an easy process seems unusual to them. "

I'm thinking of a career change and am willing to spend the next year training myself up to become a data analyst or data scientist. Currently I am auditing the data science track through coursera, and am looking at the udacity nanodegree as well, and am considering applying to a masters of data science at a Canadian university (because I am Canadian, and not willing to shell out international student fees). 

My question to those of you who hire data scientists/analysts is this: What do you look for when you hire? 
Advanced degrees? (In what?)
Portfolio? (What sorts of things should be in my portfolio?)
Anything else? 

Also, would it actually worth it for me to go to grad school for this? My educational background is in human biology/neuropsychology, but I did voluntarily focus on the stats/programming end (so I am familiar with SAS and C++, with a bit of python thrown in from that sad time in uni when I wanted to code visual novels...). However, I do find myself wondering if I should be going through a structured educational regimen to be useful to employers. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

how would you cluster chat messages in threads?,4,3,False,False,False,datascience,1486342485,True,"Hello,

I'm new to ""data science"" in general. To learn, I'm using a side project idea where I'm trying to digest daily chat conversations.

  

But to do so, I first need to create message thread (clustering?) out of chat message.

  

this is the model of the `Message`:

    User=string
    timestamp=int (unix timestamp)
    text=string

I have 13,000 of these messages.

  


My initial idea is to cluster the messages based on timestamp since usual conversations happen in bursts (20-30 msgs over 3-5 minutes, then nothing for hours, etc).

  

I tried using DBSCAN (using `scikit-learn`) but it doesn't seem to work well for single dimension dataset.

  

Any kind soul could point me in the right direction?

  

Cheers!

Gaining the right Data Science/Analytics Credentials,6,2,False,False,False,datascience,1486520357,True,"First time poster in this sub seeking advice on how to properly pursue data science/analytics credentials.

Background: I'm a recent geology grad with a BS and MS focused in petroleum geology. I currently work for a data analytics company that provides geologic and other petroleum industry related data to operators (Exxon, Chevron, etc.) and service companies (Haliburton, SLB, etc.). On a day-to-day basis I work with a massive amount of data that include anything from monthly production data for an entire country to reservoir properties for  oil/gas fields. I mainly work in Excel, ArcGIS, and other industry related geoscience/engineering software packages. 

As a former intern for the company I focused on creating workflows for other geologists to become more efficient when collecting, formatting, and analyzing the data we receive for entry into our database and analysis. I also analyzed production data from an emerging basin. Now I'm looking to find ways to integrate more advanced statistics, machine learning, and other methods. Before I proceed in doing so, I feel a more formal education process may be more useful in learning the tools that data scientists use.

I'm starting to look into two options. 1) an MS in Data Analytics, 2) a Certificate in Data Analytics. Does the certificate hold any value for data scientists or is a degree a must?

Any other advice not related to the two options stated above would be greatly appreciated as well."

MS in Statistics - best electives for a career in data science? (x-post from r/Statistics),6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1486563078,True,"Hi guys,

I posted this on the r/statistics forum and I had some great answers, but due to that forum being more statistician based I wanted to see some POV's from data scientists.

I'm currently a graduate student in a MS in Statistics program and I want to eventually work as a data scientist after I graduate (currently fluent in R, Python and SQL.) Looking at my college's course website, I wasn't sure which elective classes to take that would best supplement a data science career. I'm allowed to take 4 electives on top of 6 required courses. The electives are:

* Multivariate Methods
* Categorical Data Analysis
* Design of Experiments
* Operations Research
* Mathematical Modeling
* Statistics Quality Control
* Time Series and Forecasting
* Survival Data Analysis
* Clinical Trials
* Nonparametric Statistics
* Sampling Methods
* Stochastic Processes
* Bayesian Statistics
* Data Mining and Analytics

I'm strongly leaning towards Data Mining and Analytics as well as Bayesian Statistics because I hear that is a fundamental part of machine learning. Any other recommendations?

Identifying users based on some attributes,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1486816636,True,"Hello everyone,

I have gotten a task where I have to identify users whose identity is sometimes hidden. I have two data sets: a fully labeled, and a partly labeled.

The labeled data set looks like the following: 

`date time ip email user-agent cookie`

The unlabeled data set looks like the following:

`date time ip ? user-agent ?`.

Based on the labeled dataset, I have to figure out the missing emails of the unlabeled data set.

My approach this far has been:

- Map every line to the format: `ip user-agent email`
- Look up `ip` and `user-agent` and find email.

This works for some of the unlabeled, however there are several which will have multiple hits; that is, one `ip,user-agent` key can have multiple emails associated with it.

Do you have any suggestions as to how I might identify a user further than just the `ip` and `user-agent`? Right now I'm only matching on the `user-agent` as a whole string."

I've since become quite proficient with Python for analysis and am very skilled with SQL. My machine learning knowledge/skill is moderate and I'm constantly working to improve my skills and knowledge. I've considered learning Scala, but I'm not sure how useful that'd be at this point. 

My problem is if I apply to jobs I'm thinking all they see is 4 years working as a clinical microbiologist and it's frustrating.

I'm aware that my educational background will be limiting to my options, but this is fine I just need a foot in the door of the industry and can work my way into other roles. But to get started, what are some roles that I could look into and eventually apply to without getting my resume thrown out on the spot? I'd like to know what I'm aiming for, while also being able to look up job postings and making sure I'm learning things that match up with what is being sought in my area.

The data is very noisy and there is a lot of overlap between the minority and majority cases.  

I understand the benefit of SMOTE in correcting for bias in your model.  But In this situation do you run the risk of overfitting your model and losing generalizability on future data? I've tried searching the web and can't find much on the relationship between SMOTE and overfitting on small samples. Intuitively it feels dangerous to strengthen a signal in your data that you're skeptical of to begin with. We're using 10 fold cv for evaluation. "

Need suggestion/advice on few things.,1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1487124352,True,"So I'm kind of new to data science, although not entirely a novice. For the past year, I've been working with R  for doing most of my data science work (EDA, Modelling, ML, Visualization ) and I really like it.
But I feel that I also need to get comfortable with python data science ecosystem,(and I'm not new to python, It's just that I'm new to doing data science work in python).However, after dabbling with python libraries like pandas, numpy and all the other usual suspects,  I feel that R is so much better for a lot of statistics/ml related work, It's just that it makes so much more sense doing these work in R rather than python.

But I also like various (libraries which can do some serious ml stuff)ML libraries in the python ecosystem, which is more intuitive than their R counterparts.to be more specific, the whole deep learning stack.

Now that I've established the fact that I just don't like the way python approaches the statistics/visualisation work (I'm not saying it's bad, it's just that I prefer R over python) but like the Python ML ecosystem(mostly the deep learning stack) 
what should I do?

1. should I invest more time in learning python for data science work(specifically visualisation and statistics work)
2. or should I adopt a hybrid approach, I.e. I do most of the work in R, If I need some heavy ML work I do that with python.

(The Hadleyverse in R has spoilt me, and it(tidyverse) keeps getting better every day)

give me some suggestions/advice I'm really confused
and also 

If you think option 1 sounds good and I must invest more time in learning python(for data science) and If you think I should  ditch the hybrid approach  suggest me what else should I do

What is a logical entry level position?,4,0,False,False,False,datascience,1487126803,True,"I'm someone graduating in the spring with degrees in Physics and Math. I've done a decent bit of computational physics research to the point where I've published work. In the process, I've discovered that I really enjoy the data analysis part of the work. Given that I have a relatively strong background in analytical work/mathematics/computation, I'm interested in getting started on the data science career path. 

From what I've learned, it seems that data scientists have a whole laundry list of skills/tools they are expected to know in order to be competitive in the job market. It seems that learning all of them would be impossible for all but the most dedicated autodidacts. In my mind, the best way to learn them would be to get exposed to them over time while working in the industry. 

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what would be the right path to take where the focus would be on future growth and development towards a career as a data scientist. Would it be best to try to get an entry level data analyst position? Or would something like a software engineering position be more applicable? Perhaps an internship that's more focused towards that kind of work? Would it be fruitful to instead go for a PhD in Physics before trying to get into the industry (something I've strongly considering in the past)? 

I worry that I could get stuck in a position where I'm just doing relatively straightforward plotting/analysis in Excel for a company that has no interest in more sophisticated techniques and it would be a dead end. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated."

"Are you considering Clojure in 2017? In my opinion it's a clean, functional, fast language ideal for data science. I'm diving in.",2,3,False,False,False,datascience,1487203982,True,"Clojure is a functional, dynamic language for the JVM.

- Designed with immutability and concurrent programming in mind. You can call multiple databases and APIs with your multicore processors, do complex things with the data and not have to worry much about a locking model or inconsistent state.
- Designed to look better, be more readable and be more succinct than other Lisps (e.g. Common Lisp, Scheme).
- Its integration with the JVM allows access to huge libraries, and its dedication to the JVM means that it works well with other JVM-based languages and ports (e.g. Groovy).

It is more immutable than Scala, it is faster than R, it feels more natural than functional programming in Python. It has nice things like first-class ratios. Incanter is the ""data science library"" for Clojure; however, Clojure's data structures (lists, vectors, maps (etc), all of which can be nested), and the fact that it's functional, means you can do a lot of work just with the base of the language.

I really feel that it's a bit of a hidden gem and currently undervalued and underused in the data science world. If R gives you functional programming (if you want), and Python gives you speed and good production code, can Clojure do both of those things in a succinct, seamless way?

The language has 2 main aims: data orientation, and simplicity. Not easy, but simple."

I want to leave the data science field but I'm not sure how?,4,0,False,False,False,datascience,1487373179,True,"Hi guys,

Hope you are all having a good day :) I'll try to keep this short:

I'm 25 years old, graduated with a BS degree in exercise science but realized my senior year I hated the idea of working in exercise, therapy, corporate wellness, etc. 

So I spent my last semester learning SQL in my free time, then I graduated, and then worked as a data analyst for two years at two different jobs and the last 6 months my team has started transitioning me to more data science tasks at my current place.

The issue is, I really do not like this career and don't think its right for me. But, I feel stuck because I don't know how to take my skill set and transfer it to a new career path. Absolutely everything on my resume is about reporting, SQL, R, databases, data visualization, dashboards, and so on.

The specific reason I don't like this field is actually that I realized I don't like to code. It's a total snoozefest for me. Whether it was writing some stored procedures or modeling some data. I'm sure its not just the languages that I dislike as I have some experience in c++, javascript, and java...equally boring.  Just the act of programming that is making me very, very, very, very, very, very, VERY depressed. So I figure its high time to get out of this field.

I really do enjoy some of the aspects of my job, such as getting to do math (my mentor at work is an ex-quant and has been guiding my learning in probability. It's a lot of fun!) or getting to investigate the deepest darkest corners of our database trying to hunt down some obscure table of data.

I wanted to hear from anyone who has transitioned or starting to transition out of data science and how that is going. Any advice from others on how to take our data science/analytics skill set and start a new career path? I almost considered just going back for a second bachelors in mathematics and restarting my career. Its been a shitshow trying to apply for masters programs because of my undergrad degree. But even then, I'm scared I'll end up back in some computation/programming role in my future."

Having been a loyal, albeit predominantly lurking, member of this sub for some time now. I often see the frustration (on both ends) from people looking to become employable as Data Scientists and those in the industry sick of answering the same questions.


#


Something I was really hoping to get into was a bit of branch from the commonality of these posts and more towards: “I honestly feel like I am employable/can bring value to a company, however, I can’t even get my resume through the door because I do not have a degree.”


#


For context:  I have been a freelance python developer for going on a decade now, I have competed in many data science challenges (even won a few), participated and won more than a few hackathon/coding challenges, and have gone through just about every noteworthy MOOC I have found.  This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the things I’ve compiled in my pursuit of employment – but I thought it was a good start.   That said, I have unfortunately never actually held a position which has labeled me as a ‘developer’ or anything which would seem remotely applicable on a resume when applying to a data science firm or company looking to employ someone for ______ (insert something about data).  I also hold no higher education degree.
I have carefully read many posts here which say you need to “be able to tell a story with your work,” and “demonstrate your thirst and ability to wrangle data.”  I also have a pretty decent portfolio designed to hit many of the points this sub has deemed worth showing off.


The catalyst for my current frustration (and this post if I’m being honest) came a few weeks ago when I was presenting my findings at the end of a local event and was approached by a lead data scientist, who was judging this particular competition, who went on to say something like:


“You seem to have a better understanding of neural networks than most of my data scientists and the way you designed your process was pretty innovative.  Are you looking for a job, by chance?”


Me: “I would love to come down for an interview”


Him: “Great!  So, where did you get your degree from?”

Me: “Well, I dropped out of college my sophomore year but {here’s some of things I’ve done to demonstrate my passion and pursuit of this trade – see above}”


Him: “Oh, ok…well, let me get your information and I’ll get back to you”


Me: “Well let me get you my gitlab and I can send you some ideas and demonstrations I have as well – “


Him: “Yeah, I’ll have someone from recruiting email you sometime in the future.”


I would like to clarify that I *completely* understand that I could not possibly have the theoretical foundation that someone with a PhD in stats or mathematics could have, however, I honestly believe I continue to demonstrate that I have a real passion for this work – and a fairly respectable aptitude for it.  I am also in no way trying to say that I can do the same job as someone with a PhD, or take anything away from their value.


From my perspective, this field seems to have a mindset much like software development used to be notorious for: “no degree – no job,” even though it was fairly obvious that someone could learn to code to some functional level, completely on their own (again, I completely understand the hate for code bootcamp grads vs. college grads, etc). 
 

I have to wonder if those of us who have been participating in data science as a hobby via Kaggle, Numerai, DataDriven, local events, etc – have even the smallest shot of making enough noise to get an employer’s attention (outside flat-out crushing multiple kaggle comps and creating a startup).


I have to imagine that there is a role for someone like me, even if it’s just to work with the folks with the strong theoretical backgrounds to quickly develop prototypes then fine tune – or something to that effect.  I have submitted somewhere in the region of 200 resumes, and only ever sat two interviews (which I thought and was told went very well) only to be stiff-armed by their HR departments.


I was hoping I could get some input from this sub – as, even through the smattering of reposts, someone always seems to take the time to reiterate (nicely) or provide some valuable insight to OP.  I do apologize if this particular topic has either been covered or beaten to death, but my search results didn’t bring up much.


I appreciate any thoughts or insight you guys have and look forward to hearing from you.

To do or not to do a post-doc?,17,14,False,False,False,datascience,1487848001,True,"Hi there,

I am finishing a PhD in medical image analysis. I am considering different options and I am really tempted by a data science career specifically applied to biotechnology. R&D positions in my field are attractive but there really isn't that much flexibility in terms of location. It appears to me at least that the progression of a data scientist in industry is more flexible regarding location. I do think I would be a good match for data science. In addition to any quantitative/programming skills I have, I think I'm a pretty good communicator, work well in a team and can perform well in tough deadlines.

In any case, the issue I am having is based on my machine learning knowledge. I come from a mechanical engineering background, which seldom touched on statistics or any of the core background needed for ML. Throughout my PhD, I have used many ML tools (supervised/unsupervised classification, dimensionality reduction, regression etc..) but it has never been the focus. 

However, in all data science job requirements I have seen that require a PhD, they seem to specify that you need to be an expert (or at least very knowledgeable) in many aspects of machine learning. I consequently feel quite unqualified for any of these positions or just not competitive at all.

I have recently been offered a 2-year post-doc in a very well respected machine-learning/image-analysis group within my university. Its a 2 year post-doc focused on deep-learning for radiotherapy. The position seems to tick a lot of boxes that are minimum requirements for me and I think would make me a more competitive applicant. 1/4 of it would be software development in Python/C++ and 3/4 would be deep-learning/image analysis R&D. I would be a contributor to an open-source deep-learning project, contributor to another private project, would hopefully publish a few deep-learning articles and it is deeply collaborative with various centers. 

I told the potential PI that I am looking to go into industry and would be using this as a stepping-stone. In terms of my background, will a 2-year post-doc in deep-learning/machine-vision with significant software development hinder my chances at potential career in industry? Or should I see it as an investment into my future? Would it be more worthwhile for me to apply to positions and take the best one? I am considering [Insight Health Data Science](http://insighthealthdata.com/) but I am not sure flying to the US is the best option.

I am in my late 20s now, I don't have much industry experience although I have plenty of research experience. I am fearful that continuing research at a university will really put me in a difficult position in the future. 

Thanks for reading and any comments!

So the university of edinburgh is obviously more reputable, although Heriott-Watt university also has an excellent reputation (as far as I can tell).

"Want to get into Data Science, BA in Neuroscience",7,0,False,False,False,datascience,1487952978,True,"Hey guys,

I am a senior graduating in May and I want to get into Data Science. For some background, I am a Neuroscience BA with a CS minor and I've taken a plethora of CS courses (Data Structures, Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Computational Tools of Data Science, etc.) As a non-quantitative BA, I think I have a competitive disadvantage to apply for Data Scientist positions because I am a) not a Masters or PhD student and b) not even a quantitative major. Ergo, I have decided to apply for Data Analyst positions, in hope that my experience there can bolster me to my goals.

However, even when applying to Data Analyst jobs I have found myself either getting rejections or no emails at all. My GPA is not the best (2.96) but my GPA for all my CS courses is much higher.

I do plan to go to grad school in the next two years, but I wanted to get some work experience before I do so. Does anyone have any tips about how they would act if they were in my shoes? Thanks!

There's a question called likelihood to recommend, consider this the main question a customer gets asked. I've split this into yes, no and maybe.

I'm looking to see what the key factors to improve are to move someone from a maybe to a yes.

I created a model in xgboost and it works pretty well on a test split. It's also got an AUC of around 0.85.

There's 2 things i need to do now but i'm not sure how to approach this.

1) Look at what area should be improved in order to convert someone from a maybe to a yes.

2) Model some scenarios to show what impact a movement in score x for % of people y would have.

Data Incubator or Data Science Internship?,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1487965350,True,"TL;DR Should I choose The Data Incubator fellowship over a datascience internship with a large insurance company with a high probability of converting to full time? 

Hi, I got selected as a fellow in the Data Incubator, and am in a dilemma to join it or not. 
Background: I am in my final leg of a PhD in Geoscience, and have been preparing for Data science jobs for the past one year or so. I started actively applying for jobs in January, and till now I have had interview calls only from Geospatial datascience companies. I am still interviewing, and have few interviews lined up. However, I have not had much call backs from tech companies (who desire CS grads I presume). 

Presently, I have accepted a Datascience internship offer with a large Insurance company in their analytics team, with a very good chance of converting to full time (I won one of their recruitment competitions). However, I am not particularly excited about the insurance industry in general. 

Given this, does it make sense for me to give up the datascience internship opportunity and join the Data Incubator? Recent posts about Data Incubator seem to indicate their placement record is not quite what they claim to be. Also, I am an international grad student, hence most smaller companies and start-ups won't hire me for visa sponsorship reasons. Do big companies hire from TDI? Or is it mostly smaller companies? And I would like to hear from recent Data Incubator fellows about their job hunt experience after the fellowship. Thanks in advance."

The data I have is store level sales data aggregated at a month level. 
    
One way I can think of, is to consider the monthly sales data for a store as a single, massive bill, making all the items potential candidates for an affinity model. This would let me come up with a list of items to push together. But my concern here is that the bill is likely to contain all the items that the store stocks, anyway.

What problem does a turing machine solve?,7,5,False,False,False,datascience,1488022493,True,"Hi /r/datascience,

I've been reading about turing machines and most sites explain what the machine does, e.g that the machine has a head that reads cells from an infinite (or finite) strip of paper that either contains or does not contain tokens (1, 0, or 'blank'). The machine is then instructed to either leave the token as is, erase it or overwrite the token with another token and after doing any of these operation move to the right, left or halt. 

What is not apparent to me is, what is the machine used for? What problem does it solve?

From my understanding the machine describes the framework for how a 'computer' stores information in memory, is this correct or am i mistaken?"

Value of a data science masters for an arts graduate with 3 years professional experience?,6,10,False,False,False,datascience,1488232318,True,"I know a lot of questions have been asked on here about the value of Masters courses in data science or business analytics, but most of those asking seem to have a quantitative background. I'm an arts grad who has fallen into the world of data and I'd really appreciate any advice on whether formal education might be the right next move for me.

I'm 3 years into my career at a massive tech consulting firm and I've ended up with pretty strong Tableau and data viz skills, with a decent amount of SQL and data modelling through the projects I've worked on. I'm now working with Hadoop (Hive & Impala) and have started learning R.
Supposing that I could even get accepted onto a decent course, a masters in the EU looks to be around £12,000, and it's highly likely that I could come back to my current job after the graduating - so not a huge amount of risk in taking one. Would it be worth doing?

My main reasons for considering it are:
1) I would love to take the time to focus purely on studying things like stats, machine learning, NLP, the latest database technologies etc. full time. Even if it made no difference to my career I feel like a year or two spent studying something I'm really interested in would be time well spent.
2) I don't have a formal education in anything technical/quantitative. So far I've got by through self-teaching, but feel would feel out of my depth moving into a more heavily analytical role without either taking some time out to self-teach, or doing formal study.

Would a Masters be a waste of time and money - should I just carry on with self-study & online courses? 
I could equally find a Tableau contracting role with good money and fewer hours than my current job, and using the extra time to study, or I could even become full time unemployed to study by myself - would this be unattractive to future employers?

Once i have done for the features, I run random forest on this.

Ok, so I understand you can use the runif thing to get values from an uniform distribution, but how do I set the intervall from 0 to theta? Or whatever I choose theta to be?

Quantifying 'growth friction' when projecting target goals,0,0,False,False,False,datascience,1488411748,True,"Hey r/datascience!

As part of my DS work I spend some fraction of my time helping the team make growth projections, either for setting growth targets or when forecasting actual data.

There is obviously a range of ways to go about doing this but the one thing I don't have a good solution for at the moment is being able to fold in or at least quantify how much harder it is to grow in a market this year as opposed to historical years.  It is easy to anchor growth on historical rates but in markets at which you've got a solid penetration already it is likely a harder task to maintain a historical level of growth than it was to achieve that level the first time around.

I've thought about a few approaches that basically involve taking the derivative of a growth curve to look at the rate of change of growth, but it is hard to know if that is really probing the truth of how much harder it is to grow, or if its just that we're doing a worse job and growing more slowly!

Does anyone have a good approach to either measuring some sort of 'growth friction' for a current year vs historical years, or perhaps some other forecasting technique that allows information about this to be folded in somehow?

How should I move into the field of data science? Trying to pick between plans...,11,8,False,False,False,datascience,1488461726,True,"Hello all,

I'm an aspiring data scientist.

My background:
I work in software test automation at a Fortune 500 company. My degree is in business and I had a 2.8 GPA (lots of regrets, lazy student). I'm a self-taught programmer and I have been teaching myself machine learning and data science through books, MOOC's and DataCamp. I've got R and Python projects for data science on my GitHub (albeit simple projects). I keep a blog on my data science journey and I'm working on starting a machine learning and data science meetup in Columbus, Ohio. I'm trying to pick between three ways of getting into data science.

First Option:
I was planning to return to school for mathematics. I found a program through Indiana University that would allow me to continue working full-time while finishing a B.S. part time in mathematics. I would then, hopefully, move into getting a M.S. in Statistics. This plan would likely take 5 years and I likely wouldn't have to take out loans (I make good $$ and we have a good tuition reimbursement program at my company)

Second Option:
Pursue a M.S. in Data Science through Indiana University. [Here is the program curriculum.] (https://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/data-science/graduate/courses.html) There's also the program through UIUC, but my GPA is too low. I've already spoken with IU and the fact that I'm driven to do this work and have projects is bonus, but not a guarantee that I would get in. This program would allow me to also keep working and would take 2 years.

Third Option:
Get a MBA in Business Analytics. This would be the easiest program for me to get into, but the one which I'm the most apprehensive about.

"Career Advice: Hitting a Wall, Leveraging Skills for a Career Transition",8,12,False,False,False,datascience,1488686948,True,"So I got into the data analytics field kind of haphazardly. My degree is in a social science - but I had taken quite a few applied Stats courses in undergrad. My programming skills in Python and R were almost entirely self-taught however.


I pretty much envisioned going on to be a data scientist; but after trying out some graduate courses in data science, I realized that I simply do not have the mathematical aptitude necessary to really excel in the field beyond the ""Data Analyst"" type of role. Nor do I think I have the mathematical aptitude to get the graduate degree I would likely need to advance in the field.


I currently work as a Data Analyst (2 years out of undergrad); but I'm quickly getting bored of the relatively basic statistics and BI reporting/dashboarding. 


Additionally, my natural strengths are more qualitative and I'm realizing that I'm really hindering myself by being in a job where I am using none of my natural strengths.  


I'm worried about making a career change because I'm not really sure what path someone like me should take. I like data analytics and I don't really want to do something completely unrelated; but I want a field in which I can advance. 


Is there a career transition (where I could leverage my experience so I'm not completely back at square one) that would be good for me? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

Help with Tensorflow and CNN,2,5,False,False,False,datascience,1488740926,True,"I'm trying to learn deep learning using tensorflow and convolutional neural networks with the MNIST dataset through Udacity.

I'm trying to create 3 convolutional layers with 1 fully connected layer, but I'm having a tough time understanding what's really going on between each layers.

So for example, the shape of my training images dataset is (48400, 28, 28, 1), and some example code:

    batch_size = 16
    patch_size = 5
    depth = 16
    num_hidden = 64
    image_size = 28
    num_labels = 11 # including ""blank images""
    num_channels = 1 # grayscale

    graph = tf.Graph()

    with graph.as_default():
        # input data
        tf_train_dataset = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape = (batch_size, image_size, image_size, num_channels))

        tf_valid_dataset = tf.constant(valid_images)

        # variables
        layer1_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_noraml([patch_size, patch_size, num_channels, depth], stddev = 0.1))
        layer1_biases = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([depth]))

        layer2_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([patch_size, patch_size, depth, depth], stddev = 0.1))

        layer3_weights = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([patch_size, patch_size, depth, depth], stddev = 0.1))
        layer3_biases = tf.Variable(tf.constant(1.0, shape = [depth]))

        layer4_weights = tf.Varaible(tf.truncated_normal([image_size // 4 * image_size // 4 * depth, num_hidden], stddev = 0.1))

        layer5_biases = tf.Variable(tf.constant(1.0, shape = [num_labels]))

This is only a part of the code, but if I try to run this, I get an error saying:

    ValueError: Dimensions 256 and 7854 are not compatible

I'm thinking that layer3 is at fault, since this works if I take layer3 out and work with 2 convolutional layers.  However, I don't understand what's actually going on.  Is it because the size of the kernel is the same as layer2?

Hi /r/datascience,

I'm an undergrad CS major taking a course on big data comprised of mostly masters students. The course has a final project where we use big data tools/frameworks (Spark, Hive, etc.) to perform some sort of analysis on a large dataset. 

For this project, we're allowed to do it on our own or join a team of up to 3 students. As an undergrad (junior) looking for data science roles, I was wondering if it makes any difference whether I join a team or not. On one hand, doing the analysis on my own makes me more familiar with the entire analysis and has me write it all. Conversely, working with a team can show GitHub workflow skills, general responsibility-partitioning, etc.

Those who have been in hiring manager roles or have had this experience: what do? Does it matter at all? Thanks!

**TL; DR:**

- Undergrad taking masters big data course

- Final project right around the corner. We can work in teams or on our own.

- Does it look better if I do it all myself, or work on a team? Am I overthinking this?"

"When deciding a career path (i.e., grad school, job type, industry), you need to decide on an end-goal",12,15,False,False,False,datascience,1488924384,True,"I think this subreddit has a lot of great content on short-term data science advice: tools, technologies, whether or not to take the job/go to grad school/etc. However, I don't see enough discussions regarding how short term decisions are impacting your long term (think 10-15 year) trajectory.

""Where do you see yourself 5 years from now"" is a really cliche/kinda worthless question to ask. However, for a data scientist, asking ""where do I see myself 15 years from now"" is actually a very, very important one to answer.

This would be my guidance:

**Align yourself to one of three broad tracks:**

**- Principal Scientist**

**- VP of Data Science**

**- VP of (insert traditional business unit, e.g., Marketing, Supply Chain, Sales)**

These are your three major tracks. They move in (mostly, all other things equal) increasing order of responsibility, soft skills and salary, and decreasing order of hands-on data science work, technical proficiency and job security.

Obviously there are career paths that don't fall in this track, namely starting your own company. But I think that, for most people, this is an accurate set of end-state options.

Becoming a principal scientist means you have likely reached a level where you are the only person alive that knows how certain things work, you are one of two people that can make changes to it, and even the CEO of your company is afraid of what's going to happen when you leave. There may or may not be an emergency plan if you get hit by a bus. As a result, you get to call a lot of your own shots in terms of scope/type of work. On the flip side, there is a ceiling to how much you can be paid because you are not an executive, and executives decide how much money people make (I'm being a bit tongue in cheek here... but only a little bit). You most likely have a PhD, you are most likely incredibly smart, and you most likely don't care too much for people who are not as smart as you. 

Becoming the VP of Data Science means that you now oversee a whole department of data scientists, and yet, you will likely never touch a line of code again. Your time is spent making sure that what your department produces is appropriately valued by the company, and that you can connect company needs and goals with the broad direction your team is taking. You excel at taking complex scientific language and making it palatable to regular people. You are able to convey value to stakeholders, you are able to sell your product, and you are able to do that while also understanding everything your team does at worst one notch below the person who did the work. 
At some point, you were likely a very good data scientist, but what set you apart was not your data science skills - it was standing out as someone who could steal job from your boss by going to meetings, talking to customers, making tough calls, etc. You may or may not have a PhD. You are incredibly sharp. You get along well with most people, but deep down, you judge the crap out of everyone who doesn't have a great understanding of data. You make very good money - but there is always pressure for you to push your team harder and get more results. Lots of travel. Lots of meetings. The biggest drawback? The odds that you'll get promoted to CEO are low, because the traditional functions are always the most likely candidate for that.

Becoming a VP of any other function means that data is no longer your main tool - it's now your secret weapon. You spent the last 10-15 years moving up the ranks and learning how to leverage data to make better business decisions than everyone else. When someone started talking hypotheticals and opinions, you started talking data and facts. And your boss noticed. And your boss' peers noticed. And you started getting invited to more meetings, more projects, and more decision-making events. Now you're managing an entire division of the company, and you're doing it with data on your side - the only way you know how.
You can talk to a wall, you can sit in the room with the heavyweights and you feel perfectly at home there. You know how to play politics, and you kinda like it. You have built a strong team of supporters on the way up - you're good at what you do, so it wasn't that hard.

Which one of these three sounds like the most attractive should certainly shape which decisions you make.

More importantly: you should have a very honest conversation with yourself as to whether or not your strengths align with each specific path, and if not, what you need to do to strengthen your weaknesses."

I know a lot of similar posts are made in this subreddit, but I could really use some advices, please bear with me!

I am currently finishing up my bachelor in mathematics and actuarial science, so I have a decent understanding in statistics, finance and programming. I have completed 4 actuarial exams so far. 

I am currently finishing up Andrew Ng's coursera class on machine learning, and I absolutely loved it. I am seriously considering pursuing this career path instead of actuarial science. 

Do you think I have the right profile to make the switch?  I have already used R, MatLab, SAS, VBA and python. My next step would be picking up SQL and try to hone my programming skills on Kaggle. Would I be able to net an entry level job in the field with a few competition under my belt?

Tips and advices are greatly appreciated,

Thanks!

"Applying for jobs through the ""front door"" a waste of time?",5,10,False,False,False,datascience,1488950806,True,"Hi, I have a MS in Stats but my previous work experience has been in unrelated fields. I've been learning data science on my own, have been working on a project, all that stuff. However, I wanted to ask about the interview process, specifically how to get interviews in the first place. I'm trying to find a job in the SF bay area.

A lot of people have told me that directly applying to public job listings (like on linkedin, indeed, etc.) is basically a waste of time because there are hundreds and hundreds of applications and recruiters usually screen out all but the most qualified on paper, like people with PhDs and/or a lot of previous experience. I only have an MS and no previous experience in data science itself, although my degrees are in highly relevant fields from pretty good schools. These people tell me to not even bother with it and to focus all my time on networking, getting referrals, etc.

Others have told me that I should basically mass apply to all of those listings because it can't hurt anyway. Of course referrals are more likely to get interviewed, but ""front door"" applications can still work, it's just a numbers game and eventually you'll get lucky.

In fact there was an AMA here recently (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5w1jhk/recently_hired_data_scientist_big_career_change/) where the person said they basically just did that: sent out a ton of front door applications and got 25+ interviews with 5 offers. And they didn't even have a graduate degree, only a bachelor's.

So anyone here with relevant experience, especially if you've recently been hired near San Francisco/Silicon Valley or are a recruiter/hiring manager, what do you think is the best way to proceed, from your experience? Thanks!"

Customer level sales modelling?,9,13,False,False,False,datascience,1489229325,True,"I need advice on the following problem. 

I have transaction-level sales data from a chain of stores. I.e. I know exactly who bought what, when, at what price, whether there was a discount or some other promotion on that product. Most customers have loyalty cards and thus I know their full purchasing history. Others don't, and then I can only link their purchases within one basket but not across multiple baskets (multiple store visits). Also, there is a hierarchical classification of all products into categories, subcategories and so on. 

Here's what I'm supposed to do:

- for every promotion the store was in the past (e.g. 50% off chicken nuggets for a week) I need to calculate the impact of that promotion. I.e. how many more units of the product were sold because of the promotion than would have been sold otherwise. This is not trivial because sales fluctuate significantly even in the absence of any promotions
- calculate the impact of a promotion on a wider category of product. I.e. if the 200% uplift in chicken nuggets sales was because people saw the promotion and decided to spend more money that week or did they simply bought the promoted chicken instead of other types of meat that they were going to buy (and thus the net gain to the store from the promotion is 0)
- predict for a promotion planned for the future, what its impact is going to be


The old-fashioned way to do this is through time series analysis. You aggregate chicken sales to a weekly level, expecting a more or less smooth curve. If the curve has a peak at the time of promotion then the size of that peak (relative to pre-promotion level) is your sales uplift. This kind of (barely) works, but it's super inaccurate and when you try to judge the impact of a chicken promotion on total meat sales, you get only noise. 

The way I'm trying to do it now is via a customer-level model. You run a great big regression that tries to learn what an individual customer is going to buy over a week. The target is the number of units of chicken nuggets purchased by a customer who has visited a store at least once during the given week. The features are: 

- the customer's demographics
- average spend on chicken in the previous week
- spend on other stuff in the previous weeks
- time of year
- weeks till christmas etc.
- whether there is promotion on chicken
- what is the discount level on chicken
...

The training examples for this regression are all the (customer, product) pairs of customers who could have bought a given product, because they visited the store in a week when it was being sold. This is vastly more than the number of customers that actually bought it. 

When the regression is trained, I can use it to predict how many units of chicken anyone would buy with or without promotion going on. Then I sum it up over all customers and it does a really good job at capturing actual total sales. 

**But.**

I have only managed to do it for individual products in a single store. There are hundreds of thousands of individual products and millions of customers. There is no way that I can scale it to cover every customer-product combination (I'm doing it on a cluster already). There must be some kind of hybrid approach that will utilise the customer-level data (unlike the time-series method) without actually materialising the cartesian product of all customers with all products.

Any ideas?"

2. Data structures and Algorithms, Discrete math, and the third class I haven't taken yet will either be theory of computation or recommender systems
3. Applied Data mining, database design
4. Lots of programming (in order of strength): R/JavaScript, C++, matlab, Java/Php, Perl, Python
5. sql, nosql

Also:

1. I am a TA for scientific programming 
2. In the fall I will TA for server side programming
3. I have interned as a front end web developer and very comfortable with javaSript, github, linux, php, MVC, OOP etc.

The goal is to eventually get a PhD in a program that has a DS with a concentration/track in a certain area perhaps? Like DS + biology. Between the time I will apply to schools I have a gap where I could either:

1. Do a graduate certificate in data mining
2. Do a DS bootcamp
3. Take more random courses (not sure which would be most useful to me...more math?)

I'm not sure which of these 3 options is better. I guess my main 2 questions are, 

* how much direction should I have as far as knowing what domain I want to work in?
* which of the last 3 options do you think would be most beneficial, and what other math do you recommend?
* anything else you wish you would've known?

Feel free to give me the straight truth! And thanks!"

I have been a stay at home dad since graduating undergrad (in poli-sci).   My son is turning four and in preschool.  We need a second income.  My undergrad degree is not the most marketable, and I applied to and was accepted to a MS in Analytics program.
After reading this sub every day, I get the feeling that people in the industry see these degrees as more of a cashgrab by universities and not the ideal path to a career.

I am under no illusions of becoming a full on data scientist upon graduation of the program.  . Analyst? fine with me. I am fine just getting myself into a career to help support my son and take the burden off of my wife. I feel the tools I will receive from the Analytics program will be valuable in the job market.

My main worry is taking out a loan on a second degree that does not end in a career path.

Jobs in data science,4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1489444132,True,"I have always been interested in machine learning and neural networks so over the past several months I have begun learning as much as I can about data science.  At first I was fascinated by all the theory that goes behind teaching a computer to think, but as I started looking for jobs I discovered that a lot of them weren't exactly what I was imagining.  From browsing job posting sites I have started to feel like there may be a surplus of ds jobs that are basic visualization, warehousing, and just optimizing business profits.  This sort of turns me away from ds honestly.  I feel like I am not interested in just optimizing business growth or visualizing business data or storing business data in a warehouse somewhere.  What originally fascinated me was all the cutting edge neural networks and machine learning algorithms and how people were developing computer vision and self driving cars and doing all sorts of *interesting* stuff by teaching computers to think.  So I guess this draws me to my question: if I continue learning ds will I find a job that interests me?

Looking for career advice: recent graduate (B.A. in Math) with no luck after 3 months of job searching. Where do I go from here?,28,2,False,False,False,datascience,1489456964,True,"**TL;DR:** What do I need to get into data science after a B.A. in Math?

I'm looking for advice on how to get into data science as all of my efforts seem to be fruitless. I'm thinking about a masters in stats or analytics, but it seems like people are pretty down on them as a whole.

 I just got B.A. in December in Math (with a stats focus) and a foreign language from a good state school. My undergraduate GPA was a 3.5, with a 3.0 in math (not great, I know.) and a 4.0 in the foreign language (and summa cum laude from research).

I have a year of experience as a research assistant where I wrote Python scripts to analyze large quantities of data using various techniques, including neural networks. I don't necessarily have any ""big data"" experience, however. No external publications, either. I also have experience working as in a physics lab -- but that's not particularly applicable.

I'm great with Python, and OK with SQL and Java. I also have MATLAB experience and a host of other miscellaneous programs that aren't necessarily relevant (LaTeX, etc.). I don't have SAS experience, but I'm working on it.

I've applied for literally hundreds of jobs in my area (a pretty big tech hub) including internships and full-time data science and analytics positions. I've had two callbacks and one in-person interview. On the surface, everyone who I've asked to look at my resume and cover letter thinks that it's pretty good -- as in, there aren't any glaring errors. 

So basically, where the hell do I go from here? I'm planning on applying to my state school's MS in Business Analytics as well as maybe a few other programs, but everyone on here seems to be pretty down on them... Are they worth it if sufficiently technical? The only problem right now is that I should have figured out that I'd need to apply much earlier -- most deadlines have already passed. I just took the GRE today and got V:170 and Q:163. 

Basically, I'm totally at a loss and I have no idea how the hell I'm supposed to go forwards in data science. Any advice would be seriously appreciated. "

MSCS or MSDS to best prepare for a role in data science?,1,9,False,False,False,datascience,1489621936,True,"I apologize if this has already been answered in some form here.  

I'm a graduating physics major contemplating transitioning to data science as a career.  I have fairly relevant undergrad research experience (bioinformatics-type stuff), and I feel that I have a relatively strong CV for entrance into a CS program.  As such, I have applied to a few and am still waiting for admission letters.  I have already been accepted to a reputable data science program at a good university; what I'm concerned about is the lack of research grants for graduate students.  Ideally, I'd like to complete my masters with minimal debt, and it seems like CS programs have more available funding for grad students.  

Another consideration is the future of data science itself.  I'm more interested in the statistical analysis / business analytics side, but from everything I've read and everyone I've talked to, automation is a big consideration for the future of the field.  I've read that data science will likely move toward implementation rather than analytics as tools become more powerful and easier to use.  This would make a CS masters more attractive... But I'm slightly more interested in the material taught in DS masters programs.  Frankly, analytics is more interesting to me than low-level coding (I really enjoy statistical modeling and simulation though!)

In need of suggestions regarding Data Transformation,1,0,False,False,False,datascience,1489662782,True,"I am conducting an online survey on Qualtrics regarding users' literacy in search engines (ex. Google search).

I am measuring their both perceived and objective literacy. Perceived literacy is measured with 7-point scale. Regarding the objective knowledge, I made 7 multiple choice questions with one correct answer. So users may acquire from 0 to 7 points as an accumulated score for their objective literacy.

So I am planning to combine 7 multiple choice questions into one variable with accumulated score. (Ex. Respondent answered 4 out of 7 questions, as a result he/she is assigned 4points)

Then I'd merge objective and perceived literacy variables into one overall literacy ( ex. Respondent indicated 5 for perceived literacy and scored 4 points for objective literacy. So the mean value of newly created variable out of these two is 4,5)
However, I don't know how to put it on practice. Not sure whether Qualtrics has such features and for statistical analysis I am using IBM SPSS statistics.

Probably I could merge two variables with Confirmatory Factor analysis, however, I still have no idea how to transform the multiple choice questions with one correct answer.

"Looking for data sets or apis to auto-complete incomplete house address including details such as pin-code, city, area name, etc. Anyone knows anything helpful here?",2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1489670032,True,"Hi people,

I'm working on a ""house address completion"" algorithm.

I've been considering making a transition from my current background (psychology with a higher-than-average grasp of statistics) to data science. I've spoken to quite a few different professionals and have received varying advice. Most of them have  either worked with data scientists or are I.T professionals, but none of them were familiar with data science personally.

Specifically:

1. What's the training like? I'm eligible for a Masters at a good Australian university, but I don't even know if it's necessary.

2. Would I benefit from studying in my own time then just doing a PhD instead? I have minimal interest in academia after seeing what happens to the people that don't make it big.

3. What are some of the best institutions to study it if it's a good call? My grades are good and I'm very interested/motivated. I also don't have any financial constraints at all, so I can study in any country (I'm based in a country that has 0 decent universities).

If anyone has time or is willing to talk, I'd also love to either Skype sometime or talk via PMs. I've been travelling a lot lately to meet people and have realized I get way more out of actual conversations than trading messages online. Thanks in advance =)

I'm just two years out of school (Mechanical engineering and MBA) and pretty much wandered about since then. A lot of factors and forces are coming down on me right now and badly require a job. Long story short, 25 years after birth, I've realised I want to be one of two things, if not both: (1) Data scientist and (2) Product Manager. According to my plan, with either job, I'll be launching a part-time business. So I will be picking up Product Management skills there, so I've sorta made up my mind to enter the industry/field as a data scientist. Due to certain personal pressures, I want to convert the first interview I get!!

I got in touch with a CEO of a fast growing start-up who was willing to consider me as a special case and gave me an assignment to complete in 1.5 days. I took 2.25 days give it, but he's friendly enough to not mind that (atleast seems so). Anyways, guys, I'm not a charming guy who can talk his way into jobs (in fact I'm the opposite) - I need to work for it! and I want to too! Just need good guidance from good mentors!

Firstly, I just submitted the assignment (segregation task in python).. while I submitted SOMETHING, I am not at all confident, if the code is going to run on his machine as it did in mine (more worrisome because towards the end, it even stopped working on my machine- I simply submitted out of frustration!) He said He'll get back to me next week due to travel, work, etc.

I already plan to surprise him with some additional work that he didn't ask for- but really what i need is some confidence that my code will work and is appropriate for the task because I dont know what is right for what! I have good qualifications otherwise, he might actually be expecting me to sweep him off his feet. So, I think a review/followup etc within 24-48 hours would help the cause.

Apart from that, would love to be touch for advice, direction and problem-solving practice!

As I am an international student, my goal is to repay my loan as soon as possible after my graduation by working in the US (on the OPT extension) in case I am not able to secure an H1B Visa later.

I will list my Pros and Cons about the two universities and would appreciate any and all suggestions.

**Columbia Data Science**

**Pros:** 

* Ivy League University, hence the reputation
* New York City provides many opportunities for data science

**Cons:**

* Large class size (about 100 students)
* Does not provide placement statistics like mean/median starting salaries of students
* OPT Period of 17 months, which, I think, is very short for me to repay my loan
* Only two classes have graduated thus far as compared to Northwestern's four

**Northwestern Analytics**

**Pros:**

* Extremely impressive placement stats (with class of 2016 managing $105k median starting salary and 100% placement)
* Complete curriculum focussing on descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics
* Small class size (about 50 students)
* OPT Period of 29 months, which is a whole year longer than Columbia's

**Cons:**

* Set in Evanston, near Chicago, so I am not sure whether most students end up getting placed in Chicago or whether they get offers in New York or California, and whether Chicago is a good place for Data Science"

Problem with predictive analytics with SPSS Modeler,2,5,False,False,False,datascience,1489945228,True,"Hello data experts of reddit,

I need help regarding a project for my university as I am more or less new to data science and the tutorials Ive found werent really helpful.

I have a dataset of around 800,000 time stamps within an interval of 5 minutes from 2009 until 2015. Furthermore, I got information about the sales of a restaurant within these five minute frames, information about the weather, the number of potential customers and whether the restaurant was open or not. 

The task is to predict the number of sales for the time frames of 2016.

As I havent any experience with Python or R I tried SPSS Modeler. I know that I have to do a time series analysis and Ive watched some tutorials for the SPSS Modeler. When using the time frame model the program says that there is a limit of 100.000 rows. I got around 800.000 rows. Is there anything I can do about it or is SPSS Modeler just the wrong program to use? Furthermore, it seemed problematic that I want to use variables of different kind (e.g. Temperature: metric, Is the restuarant open: ordinal). Do I have to adjust the variable types in order to find the right approach?

Data Science Technique Selection: I need to auto-complete/standardise user-input street addresses & have ~200 in sample. How can I maximise precision & minimise omission?,5,4,False,False,False,datascience,1489968662,True,"I have street addresses (written in all sorts of formats) & no other data. My sample consists of about 200 such addresses.

I engineered some features: word count, character count, comma-count (many of them dont have commas even though they have full addresses), pincode present, city present, manually checked resolvability, can Google maps parse it without the phrase needing to be modified.

I've figured out that all un-resolvable ones have wordcount <2 and comma-count <2, using simple exploratory analysis. So, if I ignore all data points in this category and simply run the rest of them through Google, then I'm getting a very good predictability rate i.e., I can standardise the address into components such as locality, street name, city, pincode over 99% (low type 1 error) of the time. However, this also means that I'm leaving behind many many data points that could benefit from running through Google i.e., out of the omitted ones, ~40% can be parsed into some structure i.e., I can get the city name or pin code or something else useful from google. But I do not want to run all of them through Google as a) thats expensive and b) it's more likely to give me a misleading result than a useful one.

So, I need to figure out a way to classify all my addresses into two buckets: 1) whether I can parse them (using Google) or 2) do I simply leave them be. As you know by now, my data-set consists of original address text and a few binary features (pincode present or not, etc) and a three whole number ones (wordcount, comma-count, character count). My to-be-predicted Resolvable feature is also going to be a 0 or 1. I'm open to creating more features if need be. I find this lack of continuous variables somewhat troubling.

I'm new to this and only know linear and logit regression. So I'm sure that both aren't useful to me here. What techniques are appropriate here to reduce my omission of good data points? I need some sort of non-linear classification but dont know which to use or how to approach.

All ideas/suggestions/comments/advice/feedback welcome!!

PS: I didn't have to use Google maps API, but seeing the only alternative to it was to build unending regex patterns, I chose that instead."

[question] - Effective targeting to change behavior among customers who normally wouldn't buy,4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1489981852,True,"How would I go about approaching this scenario:

I want to maximize additional sale revenue  from a limited marketing budget.  I don't want to waste money marketing to customers who would buy the product anyways.  

Let's use a basic hypothetical example:  

*  Product = McDonalds location
*  Many people go to McDonalds at various frequencies (some daily, some 1x per week, some 1x per month, some never)
*  If my goal was to increase the total *VISITS*  at this location by emailing/mailing ads/coupons/videos/etc I might use variables such as AGE, GENDER, DISTANCE, INCOME, DAYofWEEK to predict binary outcome.
*  That is fine, but how do I control for the fact that some of these people are going to go no matter what?  E.g my model might find that it can capture 60% chance if you will go to McDonalds tomorrow.   
*  Building upon the above bullet - I don't want to spend money mailing out promotions to people who will go to McDonalds no matter what. How, do I optimize between sending mail to someone who goes on average 1x per week vs 1x per month vs never?

Its easy for me to build a classification/probability model for the standard buy/non-buy, but how do I go a step further and target only the people where this 'marketing' would actually be incremental?

I understand this is a pretty tough problem, but I'm looking for starting point, methodology, etc."
Communicating Data Science Results to a Non-stats Audience,6,6,False,False,False,datascience,1489981911,True,"I'm interested in hearing from data scientists who regularly communicate results to a non-stats audience.

In many cases, I find it easier to communicate with other coders/data scientists because translating codespeak into laymen's terms can be difficult.

[Question] Multi-label classification: Predict product category,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1490015299,True,"I want to predict to which product category a product belongs. A total of 400k products need to be translated from the old (less refined) to the new product category tree. (E.g. alarm clock used to fall under 'Electronics' and will now belong to 'Alarm clocks'.) So far 36k products have already been partly allocated to ~400 (out of 800) new product categories. The filling rate ranges from 1% to 95%.
Product data (among others) contains variables: name, description, price, dimensions, color and the old label . The idea was to construct features out of the unstructured variables through tokenisation -> TF-IDF.
Proposed Approach:

* Train one multi-label prediction model (e.g. Ridge classification + cross-validation + stratified CV) on the labeled data. Then predict the category only for subset that, based on the old product tree, contains all possible products. (e.g. predict if unlabelled 'Electronics' products are 'Alarm clocks')

* Based on the predicted probability present the unlabelled product to a content manager that, if labelled, would result in the highest information gain.
* Propose to which extend the remaining 400 categories should be filled (e.g. 60%) and which products to label first.

I expressed interest immediately since I wanted to learn more about data analysis and maybe pursue a career in data science. 

My only background is a few stats classes back in college and a beginner R course.   My managers know even less and have basically left everything up to me in terms of figuring out how to structure the position and what the needs are.  What can I do to prepare myself?  Aside from learning R and SQL, are there any other languages or software that can help me with my new role?  My director has mentioned that they are willing to pay for classes, are there any programs (certifications, nanodegrees, etc.) worth pursuing, especially if I want to work towards becoming a data scientist?  Do they have merit if I switch companies?

Sorry for all the questions.  This is very exciting for me and any advice would be very much appreciated.  Thank you!

I'm so confused just even installing Python and its packages(?), like I don't know where I should run conda (I kept trying inside Spyder), and am so confused with what modules, packages, and libraries are. I installed Anaconda 3.6.

I like how in R, I get an idea of ""oh, I need to scrape a page, how do I do that?"" is simple as 

[Realize: ""Oh, I need to scrape a page, how do I do that?""] -> [Google: ""R scrape webpage""] -> [install.packages(""rvest"")] -> require(rvest) -> [?rvest] -> I have new functionality, with documentation all in one Rstudio window.

Is it as easy to do in Python or will I really need to go through shell to run Conda, to download packages etc.? And where can I get documentation/help from within Spyder?

I really hope I'm just not getting it and the heaven of ease that is Python is something that I'll eventually settle in to. :( :) :( :)"

I just got a job as the first ever data scientist in a startup company. I only have about 3 months of prior experience in the field from an internship. How can I do a good job?,34,61,False,False,False,datascience,1490106804,True,"Greetings, data scientists of reddit.

I had applied to a data scientist position at an online marketplace startup of about 10-15 employees. They are now looking to start data science and analytics operations in the company.    

This startup is like Amazon for certain exotic items in India.        

And so today, I got a call from them informing me I was selected for the role. Naturally, I'm happy, but here's the thing -  I will be their **first ever** data scientist, and I have only about 3 months of previous experience in data science from an internship at a different company.      

There is nobody in the company who can guide me, and I'm far from an expert in the field. I am a graduate of Industrial Engineering with some knowledge of statistics.           

Here is the list of what I already did/know because of the internship -        

* Data wrangling and cleaning (of mostly structured data) using dplyr and tidyr        
* Feature engineering (transformations, PCA, imputation of missing data etc.)          
* Deploying machine learning algorithms (random forests, xgboost, support vector machines, neural networks, cubist etc.)         

I used R for all of the above. I have extensively read *Applied Predictive Modeling* by Max Kuhn and *Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James et al. Both these books are my go-to reference manuals.      
____________
From the job description I was given, my new job will involve -    
      
* Generating insights from data (structured, unstructured and streaming data)        
* Building statistical models to improve company operations        

The data I'll be dealing with will mostly involve their inventory database and transactional data.

Is there any advice from the more experienced data scientists here?   

What new things do I have to learn? What should I avoid doing? I want to succeed as a data scientist, or at least do a decent job in this new role. I'm rather anxious and I don't want to screw this up.

Entry Level Career Advice,3,3,False,False,False,datascience,1490176936,True,"I recently got my masters degree in Economics and am now in the very lucky position to choose between three data science positions in a central/western European country:

- Data Scientist at a large market research company: I would be the first data scientist in this city with lots of responsibility and some quite exciting tasks. Would also involve traveling to the headquarter abroad a number of times to exchange ideas and learn form senior data scientists.

- Data Scientist at a big four (PWC, EY, KPMG, Deloitte):
This work would be in advisory and would therefore involve a large amount of consulting tasks. Technically the job title would be something like ""Data Analysis Consultant"", but it is still referred to as a data science position within the company. Lowest salary but great brand name.

- Data Scientist at a large mobile network operator. Highest salary and great team with some challenging tasks. Classical data scientist position within a team.

While the decision also depends on some factors that are not included here, I am wondering which job would prepare me best for a long and interesting data science career based on the different industries and responsibilities. From a technical/learning perspective it might be the market research institute, while the big four certainly provides me with some great exit opportunities and the possibility to see a number of different industries/companies. The mobile network operator appears to be somewhat in between and is probably the safest choice. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

How much does undergrad prestige matter for a job?,5,2,False,False,False,datascience,1490178305,True,"I know for programming and engineering jobs, prestige really doesn't matter and it's more about skills.

Data science is somewhere in the middle I'd say, probably a lot more tilted toward the programming/engineering side, but there's still important business aspects. How much does undergrad prestige matter in the job search? Obviously skills are by far the most important, but does prestige factor in at all?"
Master's or not?,21,8,False,False,False,datascience,1490188509,True,"I initially posted this on the Data Science Jobs sub, but there doesn't seem to be much activity there, so I hope it's appropriate for here. 

If I weren't in such a unique situation, I would've just Googled my question, but I'm hoping this is the right place to get some good advice. Here is my current situation. Four years ago, at 37 years old, and after working as a systems admin for 10 years, I decided to return to school to pursue a career in data science. 

I am now at Cornell, majoring in Information Science and will have 3 credits remaining to graduate after this semester ends. Cornell offers an MPS (Masters of Professional Studies) in Information Science. It is a 1-year degree, with a focus on preparing students for industry, as opposed to a typical 2-year research based MS. I can apply to an Early Admit program, which would allow me to take the Master's courses next fall semester while I finish my one remaining undergrad course. During that semester I would technically still be an undergrad, so I will still be getting a ton of financial aid (i.e. not paying much at all). Because the MPS is only a 1-year program, I would only have to pay for one semester's (next spring semester) worth of tuition and living expenses (~30k total). Here is my dilemma. At 41 years old, is it worth it to take on the extra 30k in loans just to get an extra semester of schooling and the MPS degree? Here are my thoughts for and against.

PROS: The data science market is hot right now, and having any sort of graduate degree to separate myself from the rest is beneficial. The possibility of working on a data analytics project with the students from the MBA school would give me valuable exposure to the business side of things, which seems to be very important from what I have read. 

CONS: With an additional 30k in loans I would be doubling my current loan balance for one additional semester of school. I'm not sure how the MPS degree is regarded from an industry perspective. Because of this, I'm not sure if getting this additional degree and taking on the extra debt is going to start me off at a much better salary than I could attain after just graduating next fall semester with the BS.

In my own experience, I know that experience on the job, 40 hrs/wk is how you actually learn things, and part of me really just thinks I should get out there asap, but I'm worried that by not getting a graduate degree I may be limiting myself in the long run. So, any opinions out there from those either in the field, or those who do the hiring? Thanks in advance, and sorry for being so long-winded."

Did I overpromote my abilities by listing predictive analytics as an area of expertise?,26,14,False,False,False,datascience,1490267466,True,"Quick context: I have been involved in higher education research through internships, graduate school and working at two community colleges over the last 10 years. In that time, I conducted a logistic regression as part of a program evaluation for my master's thesis, helped determine significant factors of enrollment using logistic regression, used multiple regression to create residuals that would be used in part of a process to predict enrollment for the fiscal year, and employed multiple regressions as part of my path analysis in my dissertation examining factors that may impact online community college students' decision to remain enrolled in college. However, when one of the interviewers asked me yesterday if I had ever tested any of these models, I did not really have an answer. I was always focused on r-squared values for model fit as oftentimes I did not have other data available to test out the results other than what I used to create the model. 

I am concerned that I overstated my ability to do predictive analytics and am wondering if I should remove it from my resume. What do you expect someone who lists predictive analytics as an area of expertise to be able to demonstrate? One of the problems they would expect me to answer on this job would be to look at factors that predict college enrollment and to be able to test the model. Is my knowledge of how to conduct regression analyses going to be enough, or would I need a full data science background through extended training? 

My passion is to use data to help tell a story to make students successful and I thought that enrollment management analyst would be a great step in my career, but after the interview yesterday I am wondering if I am promoting someone I am not, but I may also be overreacting as well. Thanks for any advice you can provide.

"Video Game Review Scores and ""Degree of Consensus""",2,2,False,False,False,datascience,1490310355,True,"Hi everyone,

My name is Matthew Enthoven and I'm one of the cofounders of http://opencritic.com

I'm working on a feature where we display the standard deviation of a video game's review scores. OpenCritic already displays the average review score, along with information and branding conveying how that average stands in a broader view of the industry.

One thing I'm struggling with is how to make the standard deviation more approachable.

My goal is to tag each game with at least N reviews with one of the following statements:

 - ""Critics agree about this game more than usual.""
 - ""Critics disagree about this game at a normal amount.""
 - ""Critics disagree about this game more than usual.""

The two issues I'm running into conceptually are...

 - 1. Standard deviations, in general, consolidate as the number of reviews increases. Major titles get dozens of reviews, while smaller games will often only get a handful to ~20. Major titles also have higher budgets and more expertise, making their review scores more predictable.
 - 2. Standard deviations shrink as the score gets higher because there's a ceiling of 100.

Need help with ideas for a job title recommendation...,3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1490351179,True,"Hi all,

So I work in the food service industry for a relatively small company. I was brought on as a business analyst, which was a title we came up with because the position was totally new, and it was just kind of a place holder. Now that I've had some time doing the job, I'm going to have my first review and the title is going to come up. Basically, I want something a little more true to what is is that I actually do, which I'll list below:

-pull reports and analyze sales and product mix data 

-design/monitor/analyze marketing test methodology and report results and make recommendations to marketing directors

- design/monitor analyze tests for labor efficacy; things like the effects of minimum wage increases across the company, the effects of automation on jobs and our bottom line

-develop mapping tools to identify our areas of concentration and how best to allocate management resources to those areas

-development of internal tools (such as spreadsheets) to aid other departments with their processes. An example would be either building macros in VBA that automate their tasks, or building a tool for them to use for financial modeling and evaluation of leases, etc.

-Unrelated to those things I also built a real estate modeling tool which pulls a lot of data from census and other sources to come up with recommendations on up and coming areas which are prime for investment. 

There's probably more I'm missing, but that's the basic idea. Additionally I really only deal with Director level and up; I meet fairly frequently with the CEO to discuss initiatives or present findings to her. I don't think I can ask (well I did, but I think because its so new and there's a few pieces that need to fall in to place first) for a director's title. I want to accurately have a job title that is more ""data-science-y"" (this is because if I ever go to leave, which I don't want to, I'll have an easier time slipping in to some of these other roles) but I hesitate to say I'm a data scientist. I use Python, but I'm maybe at an intermediate level. For this job I haven't pulled a SQL querey, and I don't know that I will ever have to (in the foreseeable future). I also ocassionally employ GRETL. And Tableau to present findings sometimes.I do use a lot of quantitative methods, so I certainly have skill that way (my last job was economics related and I'm comfortable with math). 

I would appreciate any and all feedback, thanks guys."

Multi-Target Regression,10,6,False,False,False,datascience,1490366735,True,"Looking for some advice on the problem I have in front of me.

I have a data set of movies watched by users. For some of the users, we know that they watched the movie, and what their rating is for that movie. For many others we know they watched the movie, but don't know their rating of that movie.

I am looking to find a way to apply a predicted or perhaps interpolated rating to those users movies they watched based on the larger dataset that has movies ratings. I am trying to find out what the best course of action around this would be. I have 1.5m users and 20K movies; however only 10% of those movies are rated by about 85% of users.

My approach is thus looking at cosine similarity and interpolating the rating based on the neighbor; and if the nearest neighbor doesnt have a value for a specific movie, go to the next nearest until all the movies have a rating. The other approach is looking at NNMF to apply ratings, and having 2*features-- one binary representation of the movies, the other the rating. So when I look to ""predict"" for a user, Ill input their binary movie values and it will return their ratings.

My questions are: Does the NNMF approach make sense? I have never used NNMF in that way. Also, are there any other models you think make sense? I am wondering if their is more of a prediction algorithm that can be employed rather than an interpolation-- I was told once that Neural Nets might help with predicting this, but I dont see how with 20K features that any prediction model can handle this."

Optimal mean for a specific data set?,13,4,False,False,False,datascience,1490398489,True,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but it's the only active data analysis related one :)

So, I'm analyzing data that I know will have a high variance. (AKA the set of numbers will have a high range). What is the best way to take this into account when calculating the mean of the data set?

Ex. I have a data point labelled ""Team 1"" and it has these values for 6 games:
95 95 0 75 40 100

I need to calculate the most probable value for their next game, but it won't necessarily be the mean of all those, because they did exceptionally well when they got the 100, and their team was incapacitated when they got the 0 as their score.

How do I calculate their predicted score for the next game, taking these factors into account?"
Confused on learning route,4,4,False,False,False,datascience,1490401061,True,"I know this question has been posted numerous times, but please bear with me.

There are way to many options out there that I don't know which route to take. I am currently majoring in Computer Science, and want to go into Data Analysis. I have taken one statistics course at my college, but don't have the options to continue on with that in school.

Right now, I am signed up for [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), which I definitely want to finish. But it seems like it teaches you more about the tools of data science and less about the thought process and other techniques.

There's like an infinite amount of resources out there, and I'm confused about which one to pursue. For example:

* [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/)
* Foundations of Data Analysis edX [Part 1](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-data-analysis-part-1-utaustinx-ut-7-11x) [Part 2](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-data-analysis-part-2-utaustinx-ut-7-21x)
* The Analysts Edge [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-2)
* Statistics with R Specialization [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)
* Machine Learning by Andrew Ng [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

And so many more.

I graduate in May of 2018, so I'm trying to be marketable by December to give me a chance to find an actual full time job by next summer. I'm excited about Data Science and Machine Learning, so motivation is not an issue.

Does anybody have any suggestions on which of these I should pursue, or other options? I like the dataquest.io route because it's hands on, but it's also pricey. I also figure I should learn something with R since I have experience with Python under my belt already.

My thoughts are to take a statistics course to complement the bootcamp I'm taking.

Support Vector Machine to Tell Me If House is Unlocked,6,6,False,False,False,datascience,1490408188,True,"Hey friends. I'm learning about machine learning for fun before I graduate and built an app that tells me if my house is unlocked or locked.

Data Science in the US vs Netherlands?,7,8,False,False,False,datascience,1490538993,True,"Hi guys,

Got a tough decision to make. I would call this a 'good problem' as I am sure I will enjoy it however it turns out. But I want to know what is actually important to me and I'm hoping you can share your unique opinions.

I've chosen to pursue a master's in Data Science and I have been accepted into a couple of schools so far. (UIUC in the US and Maastricht University in the Netherlands). The variables that I think should influence my decision (in no order) are:

* ROI - Netherlands is way cheaper than the US when it comes to tuition (like, half). But my chances of earning a good salary in the US are significantly more. *What does a graduate student earn right out of college in the NL?* 
* Job Prospects - I want to work in the same country for sometime once I graduate.  *How do you think the Netherlands compares to the US in terms of range and quantity of jobs?*

* Course Content - Maastricht provides better electives and also has a unique pedagogical method called Project Based Learning. Continuously working on group projects and presenting them will benefit me in the long term, I feel.

* Life outside work - The US is also notorious for long working hours and little paid vacation. *Mostly true?*

* Community - Europe has a language barrier. I have no qualms learning a language, but I hear not being a local (I'm from India) makes it insanely hard to grow professionally (promotions etc) in Europe. *Is this true?*

I have a choice of two jobs. Which would be the best for a future career in data science?,13,14,False,False,False,datascience,1490539931,True,"About me: I am an Economics/International Affairs double major at James Madison University in Virginia. I have tried to focus my coursework on classes that emphasized quantitative analysis. I have worked hard in school and maintained a 3.8 GPA. I have a research assistant job, work at a restaurant, and I am in the national guard.

My future career goals are to become a ""data scientist."" What I mean by this is that I want to get proficient at every step of the data analysis process from data mining and warehousing to statistical analysis and communicating the results. I have a decent background in statistical theory and some econometrics with SAS.

I have been offered two jobs this past week and I have been given a deadline of Tuesday to decide. I am from, and have family/friends in, Richmond Va.

Job 1: Think tank in D.C. where I would be an analyst in a new division called ""advanced data analytics."" I would focus primarily on health related projects, but the technical side of these. 80% of the employees here have graduate degrees. 60% have PHD's. The culture is fairly traditional and emphasizes formal education. My interview lasted only 1 hour and 15 minutes, and I met with 4 people. The people were very laid back, and I felt like I led the direction of the interview. They mentioned some projects utilizing machine learning, however we didn't go into details about it. This makes me think that the projects here would be more sophisticated, but that's just speculation.

2nd Job: Small auto insurance place in Richmond, Va. I would start out in the MIS (management information systems) where I would be using SQL to manage databases. I would do this until I got out of the national guard (2 years) then I would be sent to the UK for a year where I would train to become a pricing analyst. I would come back to Richmond as a pricing analyst and be responsible for conducting statistical analysis (SAS and R) to improve the efficiency of their pricing strategy.

Pay: In nominal terms the pay is almost the same, however the cost of living in D.C. is considerably higher.

I am in desperate need of advice. Any insights you could offer would be greatly appreciated.

edit: One of my concerns is not being able to participate in the more sophisticated work that the think tank is doing because the majority of analysts there have graduate degrees. I want to focus on developing skills, but if I'm stuck doing mundane busy work, then I don't know if it will be very valuable to me. A big plus of the D.C. job is that they have a decent tuition reimbursement program.

How to replicate 'Subreddit Algebra' in Python?

The dataset I have consists of 2 parts: 

* The individual failure events of particular (with properties)
* The summary of the total number of units (by property)

I have posted a snapshot of some hypothetical data in the same format here as it is easier to read than a reddit-formatted table:

My actual dataset consists of hundreds of failures and a much larger breakdown of exposure but this is the basic format.

Both datasets are recorded across a consistent time period.  It seems that this would be a much simpler problem if I considered the variables (Size, Strength, Age) to be independent, however it is known from experience that the variables are not independent.  For example, units of a particular strength and age are known to be highly susceptible to failure.

Can someone point me to, or recommend a method to look into for processing or analysing a dataset in this form?

I'm losing my job. How do I go from messing around to making money?,4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1490635602,True,"Hello Internets-

I'm cross posting this from cscareer since I was hoping for more advice than just 'make flappy birds,’ and since I'm really interested in data analysis. I hope I don't bother you guys too much. 

I would really like to try and get well on my way to a job in about 6 months. I know the timeline is tight, but to be frank my full time job is already starting lay-offs. If I could at least start to monetize at that point, it would be awesome.

I've been messing around programming for quite some time- mostly Python and a smidgen of R and I would describe myself as low intermediate perhaps.  I work full time, so the projects tend to come in spurts on the weekends. 

Now that I'm seriously looking at making a go of this, I'm rather lost. I know I need to tart up my github, and I have a domain that I can make into a portfolio. Should I aim at increasing my project count? What's the easiest way to begin to monetize? I know that most freelancer sites are extremely hard to make decent money. 

So far I've completed a variety of courses on Udemy, Edx, and Coursera. I mostly enjoy data wrangling so I've done things like Kaggle's Titanic project, Rosalind, and other small bits and bobs (FizzBuzz!), and I was involved with a project that extracted data from.one database, applied tool and analysis and then added it to another.  Really I've just been messing around.

I graduated from a top business school last year with a concentration in finance but wasn't able to land any gigs in the industry.

I mostly use SQL to query the database, and some pre-loaded php scripts to enter them into the database. 

I want to pursue a career in data science but without a mathematics or CS degree I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to pick up enough skills to get hired. I've been slowly learning R on my downtime and have a little bit of programming work done. I took statistics and calculus in college but nowhere the level I would probably need to be at. 

I guess I'm just looking for anyone who might've had a similar path or some kind of guidance. Thanks"

Best Practices/Software for Transcribing Data?,7,5,False,False,False,datascience,1490753216,True,"I'm a social scientist who frequently works with data which isn't digitized, and is too poorly formatted to be OCRed. So, my ""data pipeline"" typically involves an extra step of digitizing data.

My usual process for digitizing data is as follows:

1. Create detailed instructions to transcribe my data.
2. Hire two data entry firms and provide instructions.
3. Write Python script which checks differences between two CSV files (I only do this once).
4. Run script on two firms' transcription, and manually correct the differences between the CSV files.

Several things could be improved with this workflow:

* I would like to be able to directly write to a SQLite database.
* I would like to be able to enforce constraints on what can possibly be transcribed entered into a field. For example, it would be useful to enforce a constraint that dates are properly formatted.
* In some situations, I might want a simple GUI interface in which the data transcriber can see just the image to transcribe and some fields in which to enter the data.
* My script to compare the two CSV files requires the data to be entered in an exact order. If, for example, one of the data entry firms accidentally deleted a row, the error checking script would detect differences between every following row.

It looks like there are many different data entry software which might provide something like this functionality, and it's unclear whether any of them are best, or whether they provide my exact desired functionality. Additionally, most of the software are proprietary, whereas I'd ideally use FOSS.

Do you have any suggestions of desktop software, or maybe some sort of web application which would be useful for my type of data entry needs? I'm a passable Python programmer, so if it turns out there are no such options, I may end up making my own software.

Question: Using WEKA for author identification,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1490809874,True,"Hi Friends,

I am trying to use WEKA for identification and classification of documents based on author using Naive Bayes. I have a dataset of stories written by sci-fi authors such as Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick and Ray Bradbury .


 



I have converted these documents into arff file using the following scheme: 


*@relation Authors*


*@attribute textOfStory string*  
*@attribute authorOfStory {""Isaac"",""Philip"",""Ray""}*

(In training and test data - using two or more novels/short stories in each set for every author)


 


Afterwards, I converted the textOfStory to attributes using String to Word Vector (IDF transform + TF transform = true). This resulted in unigram word vectors with certain frequencies. For eg. the word attribute ""screen"" was given value of 0.44544, 0.44544, 0 for the three authors.


 



Can anyone help me understand how these frequencies are being calculated? As I have read word unigram frequencies should be helpful in identifying and attributing the author. Am I going on the right path, is this the right way to proceed through this problem? How can I compare both the data set using Naive Bayes in an interpretable manner? Any help is appreciated.

Question: How to get from a large number of patent numbers to their respective inventors,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1490819646,True,"Hi all, I don't know if this is the right place to post. If it isn't please refer me to a sub that is more relevant.

I have a bunch of patent numbers (around 5000 unique patent numbers) from the 1970s to 2017, but do not have the inventors. I want to have the inventors' names associated with the patent number. 

I know this information is readily available online as it is all in the public domain, but I am having trouble getting access to it without doing it manually. Google patents and the [USPTO](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm) would both allow me to look this stuff up manually pretty easily, but it would take a lot of time (plus the dataset might grow in the near future, meaning even more time). 

I have had a lecture on webscraping, which might be an option, but as I understand from reading the robots.txt page, neither website allows me to automate the gathering of information.

The USPTO also has a website for [bulk downloads](https://developer.uspto.gov/data). I have been trying to see if there is something here which I can use, but the files are huge (~100 GB once they are unzipped). The big problem here is that I am downloading a lot of information that is useless to me (like the full text of the patent). I do not have any experience working with these large sets of information, and I do not know the best tools to extract and manipulate this information as it crashes excel and I am not entirely sure how the data is structured. 

There is also an [API organized by the USPTO](https://developer.uspto.gov/api-catalog). I have zero experience with API's, and I have been trying to input a list of patent number instead of doing it one by one, but I have not had any luck so far. 

I have medium experience with excel, Visual basic and matlab. I am just learning R and Python.

What does real research look like?,4,3,False,False,False,datascience,1490851363,True,"I'm a rising senior in a BSc Information Systems program, and I've been involved in a few ""data science"" internships so far, but I find myself doubting the process I'm using to do the work I do for the companies I work for. 

I've worked for: a consultancy that uses telco data, including customer information and trajectories derived in-house from raw tower data; the local urban planning authority, and the city's public health board. There has been so much variation in the process used to analyse data, and I'm not trained in quantitative research, which leads me to this post. 

I was at the consultancy in sophomore year, and besides generic data engineering and database work, the main deliverable I had to show for my time was just a bunch of dashboards to slice and dice the processed data in a bunch of ways that we thought would meet the clients' needs. This company had the most data scientists (statisticians, quantitative researchers, and computer engineers experienced in machine learning) of any place I've worked at to date, but consequently I was really far removed from any of that kind of work. I mean, I did try to engage them, and they were pretty willing to try to explain their methodology to me given the hectic circumstances, but it felt like things were happening at too high a level for me to pick up on exactly why they were using the methods they were to process the data. 

At the urban planning authority, there was almost no work going on that was explicitly called data science, but I had the sense that there was some statistical work going on in a traditional research environment, like you might expect from political science or geography graduates. Unfortunately I was pretty removed from that too, and I was tasked to spend most of my time trying to coax data sets out from operational systems like databases used to publish travel times or car park availability on public road signs. There was a lot of bureaucracy, but also a lot of random exploration in stuff like VR, drones and aircraft, 3D modelling, voice-to-text interfaces for in-house GIS applications... I was super lost and isolated trying to apply the whole cycle of data exploration, question formation, model selection etc to data I could get hold of, and despite them asking me to do it since I proposed as much at the interview, there didn't seem to be much interest in what I did. Granted, the data sets I did get hold of weren't even very consequential ones by my own opinion. 

Finally, at the public health board where I'm ending my stint next week, I've been most successful in applying machine learning to get insights that they seem to receive well, but I don't feel like I'm doing real research. I've been working with stuff like wearable sensor data from participants in some public health programs, and not only do the models I know how to use seem inadequate or even inappropriate, despite seeming to produce meaningful insights... I'm not really following any proper research methodology. I know what to expect in terms of deliverables if we're talking about research papers, I read enough research to find out more about what kind of work is already going on, but it feels like there should be some kind of proper methodology to it, if I'm going to make bold claims about the data, e.g. predictions or profiling. 

I've been asked to continue on at the public health board, but I really doubt the work I've been doing. It's not a simple matter of lack of confidence in the machine learning models I decided to use, that's up to me to read more, study properly when to use what, and why. But I want to be able to improve from the position of doing analysis, using self-verified methodology. How do you have confidence in the results you achieve? What does a real research environment look like, shouldn't there be more peer review or something?"

A question about identifying incorrectly classified training examples.,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1490901276,True,"So I'm building a nearest-neighbor classifier to identify the species of a bacterium from genomic data. The details aren't important, just that I have a distance metric on bacterial genomes and I have a lot of empirical evidence that this metric is significant from a biological standpoint.

The problem is that my training examples come from a supposedly well-curated public database, but many of the labels are not correct. In some cases a genome is labeled species A when it should clearly be species B, but in other cases the concept of ""species A"" just doesn't match the natural clustering because these things were originally defined way before this genomic data was even available.

I'm stuck with this weird problem that's halfway between a supervised and unsupervised problem, where I want labels that match the ""natural"" clustering of the data while still being as close to the original ones as possible. If I could just drop 10% or so of my 70k genomes to achieve this that would be great, but I'm really struggling with figuring out how to go about that.

I'm not even quite sure what metric to evaluate how good my labeling/clustering is. The ideal is for each training example/genome the furthest genome in the same species is still closer than the closest of a different species, but I'm not sure this is possible. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how to approach this?"

I would like to get a deeper knowledge about the common architecture which is used to store and analyze big data (incl. structured data).

I have a dataset of used car lots.  From 2015-October 2016, the used cars were resold immediately without any car detailing or thorough washing.

From November to Present,  Cars received a thorough interior or exterior detailing. and then resold.

**results**
the average sales price went up after the car washes were instituted. This is holding make/model of the car constant.

**My Question**
Showing a table of car make/models and the before and after prices isnt really much of an analysis.  I want to take this as an opportunity to do more.

How should I approach references for the MSFT DS3 summer internship?,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1491332751,True,"Hello, I am applying to the DS3 internship: https://ds3.research.microsoft.com/

Only 8 students get in and I have never wanted anything more in my life. I've been studying data science fundamentals through bigdatauniversity and dataquest. 

The VP of Technology at my university is generously offering to be a reference and now I have two other references but I can only use one:
1. My CS Java professor for the past year
2. My past manager for 4 years

My CS professor has known me for a year and have built rapport with each other. He hosts meetups and I have been able to bring people to his events and he has also helped my college club with our events. He has seen me code from zero to now so he understands my work as a student. I haven't gotten less than an A in any of his assignments or classes.

My manager has known me for 4 years and knows my work ethic. The reason I am considering him is because he also knows my ambitions and that I want to be a data scientist. He has supported me through my crazy school schedules and when I quit his company, he did not want me to go. In fact, I am now in conversations to go back to my old position under his management as a part-timer. He let me know he will give me any schedule I need, even if I need to leave for an internship.

I am not sure who I should include as a reference or if I should sneak all three of them into my resume even though in the form I am only asked for two.

What do you all think?

Metis vs. NYC Data Science vs. Data Analyst Position,5,1,False,False,False,datascience,1491399293,True,"I'm having trouble deciding the best next step to take in pursuit of a career in data science. 

Background:  

I have a BS in Electrical Engineering and have 2 yrs professional experience as a Software Developer. Have been taking MOOCs in Python, data analytics, and some machine learning with some small projects to show off on github. Have been mostly looking at and interviewing for Data Analyst positions in NYC (startups and some bigger industry names) but found that I am getting beat out by candidates with graduate degrees or bootcamp experience. 

Options:

I was recently accepted to NYC Data Science Academy and am in the final interview stage with Metis. I also have another interview with a Data Analyst role in Ad Tech coming up. I don't know if I'll even get accepted to all three options, but in the situation that I do, I'm not sure which is the best move.

Thoughts:

General consensus through google search/reddit seems to be that if you're going to pick a bootcamp, pick Metis. 
The obvious drawback is that it's expensive, and I could theoretically learn the stuff on my own (if I wasn't working full time and could get super motivated).

The great part of a bootcamp is being able to learn a whole lot in 3 months and get a huge amount of help in finding a job (alumni connections, etc.). I'd also hope to make a decent amount more money so I could pay off the tuition pretty quickly.

Getting a job as a Data Analyst would obviously be great as I would get paid while gaining experience in data science. A drawback is that I might not get as much exposure to working in machine learning and advanced data science topics as I would through a bootcamp. Also I don't know if I'd get a much better job after completing the bootcamp than just taking the data analyst position now.


I know most reddit people  think learning on your own and not paying that much money is the best move, but I can't help but think the bootcamps offer a lot more than what I could learn on my own. "

Does anyone have a recommendation of a good Statistics / Statistical Modeling book? Exploring data, looking for correlations, determining the legitimacy of a hypothesis or a discovered pattern... Stuff like that.

I'm currently reading and enjoying ""Doing Bayesian Data Analysis"" by Kruschke, to give an example of the kind of book I like. Though I probably want a more traditional Frequentist perspective this time -- I don't think my new workplace is interested in moving away from the sacred p-value.

In the current state of things, we have Statisticians, Data Scientists, Data Analysts working within specific departments. Everyone was kind of doing their own thing. Some using python, some using R, some using Scala.  

We've decided to integrate them into a team to improve the value we are getting from these various services. This would be a 5 person team. Our backlog of work would includes work like:   

* Investigations
* Data analysis
* Statistical Analysis
* Forecasting
* Machine Learning Projects

We currently do all of these things, independently and often redundantly.  

We are currently trying to define our development best practices and standards:

* Coding Standards
* Analysis Formatting and distribution
* How to clean data
* What Language to use
* How to package reusable code libraries
* How to deploy machine learning web services
* How to test code

Implementing these will force some people to change certain habits, I'm posting here to get feedback on the choices we've made:  

* We chose Scala for data processing and pipelines
* Data Processing is are developed and deployed inside the databricks(Spark) platform
* We've chosen R over Python for analytical code
* R code uses the sparklyr library for connecting to Spark
* R code is done in the ""Tidyverse"" way using R for Data Science, as a bible
* Analysis must be produced using rMarkdown and saved as HTML
* ML code tries to use Spark's MLLib when possible
* All code must be in Git version control
* A new git repo is created for every analysis
* Common reusable code is regrouped in a common git repo
* Common reusable code must be unit tested using testthat

I ran into my own problems including: overwhelming materials, multiple directions to choose, getting interviews with little technical experience, etc. I want to make sure that these are things that are not exclusive to me. 

So I'm looking to mentor 3 aspiring data scientists. I will hold a skype session one hour a week to help with anything they're running into. 
Tell me:
1. Your background ( I was a special ed teacher before this!)
2. Why data science?
3. What do you love to do that is not data science related?

Pricing models: What stat technique?,1,5,False,False,False,datascience,1491683958,True,"Lets say i sell used cars. Half online. Half in person.

I have the prices they sell for in both. There are many different makes and models and aged vehicles.

I know they sell for a higher price online.  I want to find the prices that the in person vehicles would of sold for online

Would this be as simple as a linear regression with

Online sales price ~ make model year state

as my model?

if so , how do i take the results from the regression and apply it to my entire data set of cars sold in person to find thier online price. So, then i can subtract online- in person price to see the loss in profit.

Become a data analyst with a humanities background?,6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1491768689,True,"Hello all. I'm in my late twenties with a BA and MA in history, and my job is a fairly niche one (data coordinator working in publishing). I love my job but it would be difficult to replicate if I had to move, which means I'd likely have to pivot to some degree. My responsibilities and industry are closest to those of librarians, however most librarian positions require a degree in library science that I can't afford. I'm wondering how doable (with some hard work) it would be for me to land a job as a data analyst given that I don't have a CS/business/statistics background. I want to be clear that I'm under no illusions as to my chances of becoming a data scientist. I do wonder, though, if I could get a job as and be a competent data analyst without obtaining another degree. What do I need to learn/do to get there? I have somewhere between beginner and intermediate skill with Excel and Python. I'm beginning to study VBA and pandas since they would be of benefit for my current position and likely any future prospects, whether as a data analyst or some form of coordinator. I've held off on getting into the weeds of SQL because, although it seems integral to many data analyst positions, it would be of no use for my current job. Would I be able to land a job as a data analyst? Should I be focusing my efforts on a different field/position in case I need to find a new job? Thanks!"
Retrospective on leaving academia for industry data science,16,49,False,False,False,datascience,1491770035,False,
Possible venture into the Data Science career. I could use some pointers.,2,0,False,False,False,datascience,1491791934,True,"Hi folks, yeah it's going to be one of those posts, I apologize, but better to be sure before committing 100% I suppose.

Anyway, I am currently an analyst in the risk management department of a major utility company. I was originally planning to go the actuarial route (even having 3 exams passed as of now AND having majored in Actuarial Science). Recently though, I have been doing some soul-searching and am realizing more each day that the data science field is a better fit for me. I won't list why for the sake of this post, but it goes beyond the just $ of course.

At my current job, I got R and SAS on my computer (the former I have used in a project before in my last year of college). One of my performance goals this year is to at least show something basic that I believe the manager would like to see with one or more programs (especially if I discover more useful tools down the road) of this caliber, and then get more complex with it as time goes by. It's also worth mentioning that this manager *wanted* someone who can learn this stuff, so me learning whatever program I can get my hands on will benefit both of us. On top of this of course, my job (as well as my college major, as the AS program did at least involve some programming projects) consists a lot of organizing and communicating the data. I also downloaded Python on my home computer a day ago and am planning to play around with it (and possibly get a textbook of sorts on it). 

While I'm ready and willing to work hard, there is one possible caveat, I don't have a Masters/PhD, is this necessary to have? I'm primarily worried about having to go into some pricey loan if I were to do this (i.e. extra financial planning I suppose). Regardless of whether I need more schooling or not, I guess all my post boils down to is: what else should this aspiring data scientist be doing now from here?

Thanks for listening.

EDIT: I also was introduced to SQL before my current job, perhaps that is something to learn more of as well?

How to approach the multi-digit recognition problem using the SVHN dataset?,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1491799376,True,"For a little background information, the dataset can be found [here](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).

So far my plan is to crop the images using the bounding box information, normalize the image, and then reshape the images into a 64x64 squares.  These will be my inputs.

Would it be okay for me to then use the given bounding box information to crop out the individual digits in the image, then feed them into separate classifiers?  Or am I supposed to somehow be able to predict the bounding box coordinates for the digits in the image?  I tried looking up how to predict bounding box coordinates, but it seems like everyone had to somehow manually crop their photos.

100 tables (each table is a city)
each column (feature?) is a meteorological measurement (min/max temp, min/max precip, etc.)

I started applying for graduate schemes as an Analyst this year, and although I wasn't successful, I was getting feedback that my CV and applications were good. I started applying for job ads as an analyst in various different sectors, and I'm getting rejected straight away. I think it's because I'm not trained in Data Science skills, things like R, Python, SQL...

So I've applied to do a Masters conversion course in Computing Science at UEA (link below) and I've been offered a place. It looks to me like a good course for me to get a grounding in those skills. The department also sounds as if it has a very good research group involved in Data Science and Machine Learning, so my dissertation could be quite interesting. I could also do my research project in collaboration with a company, as a paid placement.

Am I too ADHD for a corporate career?,6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1491899772,True,"I'm 3 years into my job post Math PhD (1 year Data Analyst followed by 2 years Data Scientist) and I'm wondering if I'm not suited for the corporate world. I'm doing OK with my job (good performance reviews etc) and feel like I could likely have my pick of sideways-career moves, but I really struggle  staying focussed on my work in the office for 8+ hours a day, I find I get bored after 2 or 3 hours each day. And I find it hard to care about what I'm doing. I look around me and see people happily plodding along doing whatever the Product Managers tell them but I get so restless and bored. And my work has a very ""flat"" management structure, so there's almost no opportunities for advancement which I feel might motivate me in the short term at least.

I never thought I would work in a corporate office, I kind of fell into the job since I decided that I couldn't face the stress of postdoc life but i'm wondering if it's not suited to my strengths.

My favourite things about my job are 

 * answering questions on stackoverflow
 * fixing bugs in jupyter/pandas/scikit-learn
 * helping people at work with questions
 * pair programming where i can teach or learn something
 * becoming a course mentor for AI/ML on Udacity (I didn't do the course but qualified due to my work experience)


My favourite things about my PhD were:

 * Mastering difficult proofs
 * TA'ing
 * Talking with other researchers about research problems and working things out together

I'm trying to decide whether I should change careers and become a high-school teacher. Or maybe go into management where at least I would have some bigger-picture responsibilities and mentoring (or would I?). I feel like I'm not suited for the hacking away at nitty-gritty details, I don't have the patience for it and I don't think it's good for my mental health trying to fit int this. I really think I want something more conceptual/bigger-picture.

Does this ring any bells for people here? Am I deluding myself that there's a better fitting job for me? Should I just devote all my energy to get better at focussing on boring tasks?

(By the way I don't have diagnosed ADHD but i'm seriously thinking I might have an undiagnosed case.)"
Need to turn my career (and life) around - Data Science/Data Analysis seems like the obvious choice - Can I do it alone?,15,6,False,False,False,datascience,1491901569,True,"Long story short: I have had 6 miserable years at university, with a minor depression along the way. I never found any joy in what I did, but continued because I believed that my studies HAD to lead to something in the end. Turns out my gutfeeling was right, and I'm now what most americans would call a ""useless liberal arts""-student with no craft (besides methodologies) or formal skills (I even feel I fall short analytically).

However, I do have a bit of IT-knowledge, and datascience/data analysis strikes me as something I would be good at. I have a full-time job now, but I'm not very good at it, nor am I developing any new skills. This limits the time I have to study by myself, but if I want, I can put 20-30 hours a week into a new field of study in my spare time. 

Currently, my focus has been on learning Python, and I've picked up the data-analyst course on Dataquest.io, which seems like a nice solution.

Im sorry for making another one of these types of posts, but I dont really have anybody to ask for career advice. I am currently a Senior in college (with one more year to go), majoring in International Relations and Minoring in Data Science. Ive been sorta going through some soul searching during this last semester and I feel completely lost when it comes to my future. 

Years ago I selected the International Relations due to my interest in foreign affairs, my experiences in Afghanistan, and a (far) wish to possibly work for the government as an analyst of some kind. I took two years of Chinese, and a bunch of economic/ analytical focused type classes. It wasn't until last year that I discovered that I kind of like statistics and ""data"", and with the help of my department I was able to enroll in my universities brand new data science minor. Ive only had three classes within the minor itself (stats,  intro to programming, and intro to data mining. All three being areas I have zero experience in), and Ive discovered that I find it all extremely fascinating and fun, but I have the problem of completely sucking at all of them. 

I enjoy learning about data science techniques and have been slowly teaching my self R Studio, Python, SAS, and SPSS. I never really cared about grades (even though I have a pretty good GPA), ive always cared more about learning skills and becoming good at them. Im sorry for the long speil, but its to set up why im asking for advice. 

I want to become a Data scientist, but unfortunately its to late in my college career to change over to something like Statistics, and I am instead stuck with my IR major. I want to know what exactly I should even do to become competitive in the job market, if there is even a point in my continuing the minor (as in I'll learn skills, but not enough to be hired), and if Data Science hiring managers would just take one good look at my education history and throw my resume away. I see so many different stories on this sub about what people did to become one, and none of them apply to my (unique/stupid) predicament. I try to talk to my professors (both in IR and DS) and I keep on getting different opinions."

For interactivity, I have used **bokeh** a little bit, but mostly I have been required to use a commercial WYSIWYG tool called **Spotfire**.

Many of my data science coworkers have used **RShiny** to build some pretty cool apps, but I have not.

Discussion: Using SQL Queries vs REST APIs,11,9,False,False,False,datascience,1492019351,True,"**Background**

When I first joined my current company, data was mostly obtained by passing around and modifying huge SQL queries to various databases, making large data dumps, and then using Python/R/Pig/Spark to clean and transform the data into something smaller and more usable.  We have now transitioned much of that to REST APIs.

*** 
**The Good**

REST APIs make for much more simple, human-understandable requests than the SQL queries, require no knowledge of the underlying database (in theory) and return data in a structured form that better handles complexity.  Responses can often be much quicker, depending on the size of the request and proper use of concurrency.

***
**The Bad**

It *seems* to make large data dumps (i.e., like with SQL) much more difficult.  Often, I have daisy chain requests, so that I hit one API, then use that response to hit another endpoint, and then use that response to hit another endpoint.  

I also find that most of the analytics tools I use (and perhaps my mindset) are built for tabular data (i.e., Data Frames).  I usually end up doing all a ton of work to pull down a large amount of complex, structured data from various endpoints, just to flatten and aggregate them all into what a SQL data dump would look like.

Choosing the right commercial ETL and Analysis platform,10,10,False,False,False,datascience,1492026513,True,"At my current position I am essentially setting up a data department for a project based digital marketing firm. The firm is young and while we have utilized data in the past, we are aiming to become even more data driven. We have a number of marketing clients (mostly music industry and health care), but also have special projects running ecommerce for larger clients, as well as in-house application(s). 

Currently I am hand-coding a great deal of the data for historical tracking (some basic Google Analytics data, Ecom data from Shopify, Facebook ad performance data, Artist(s)’ Spotify monthly listener data, etc.) into my advanced data warehouse known as Google Drive/Sheets, cleaning it and connecting it to Tableau to generate basic visualizations that I am copy and pasting into reports. It’s a bit of a clumsy way to do it but has worked for our current scale. However, as projects get larger and more intricate, I will need to spend more of my time analyzing and improving/adapting procedures (as well as other research based task-functions that are a part of my job) rather than time spent on manual data entry, cleaning, organization and clumsy report compiling. (In no way am I discounting Tableau, but I haven’t gotten over the learning curve just yet so I’m not really attuned to it’s full capabilities)

With goals decided, I am currently in the process of deciding which ETL I would like to marry us to (open-source? or perhaps commercial, i.e, Fivetran), as well as the best commercial data visualization/dashboard/access platforms (i.e., Looker, Periscope, Chariot, Consinus)

Listed below are some of the platforms essential for us to pull performance data from:

Web property analytics

- Google Analytics
- Hubspot

Ad based 

- Facebook Ads Manager
- Google Adwords

Ecommerce

- Shopify

Payment processing

- Stripe
- Payscape
- Quickbooks

App Performance

* Mixpanel

Public data

* Spotify (and other streaming services)
- Touring information
- Census
- Economic
- (collect public data from consumer reports, etc., to contextualize performance)

Internal data

- Google Sheets - some operational data (i.e., client outreach performance, hours, travel expenses, other HR data, etc.) will still be manually input

I’m also exploring ways Airtable and Zapier can help with these goals. 

Now Periscope was the company that started this search, and my only fear with them is how SQL reliant their platform is. While I don’t have any hands on experience with SQL, I’ve learned the basics of SQL through an online course and I am more than willing to learn more (and in fact having some easy/basic experience would be fun/valuable) for what this department requires, I have read one independent person on a forum write that platforms like Periscope are “designed to be used by technical developers who are experts in writing SQL queries. It is a great tool if you are looking to turn complicated queries into charts”, and if I’m not mistaken, that does not sound like us. However, the ETL we choose may change that.

Here are some of the other products I am currently researching:


ETL

* Fivetran
* Datavirtuality
* Xplenty
* Alooma
* Tungsten Replicator (open source)

Analysis/Visualization

* Periscope
* Looker
* Charito
* Consinus

We are looking for something affordable (example, periscope's $1k/mo is far too much), and ease of sharing dashboards (it would be a dream to have the ability for clients to have a dashboard they could log in to and drill down into their data if they wanted). 

Marrying yourself to an ETL is a big deal, and choosing a visualization/access platform is a hefty investment, so I wanted to come to an experienced, unbiased community to help assess our situation and what commercial or open source products may be best for us. Any insights from experience or knowledge is greatly appreciated. 

I’m just psyched to build all this out and want to make sure I choose the right tools to build it with. Thanks!"

Beginner with Questions,5,1,False,False,False,datascience,1492053198,True,"I am currently completing two Master's degrees in STEM fields. I have accepted a PhD position in epidemiology and will begin my studies in the fall. However, I am interested in the biostatistics side of Epidemiology and would like to eventually pursue a career in data science. Unfortunately, I have no programming experience other than playing around with HTML back in the day for MySpace layouts. Moreover, I have only recently become more fully aware of the wonderful world of statistics and the careers available within this field. I always knew statistics were used by scientists, but did not really comprehend that the scientists doing the research were not necessarily the ones performing the statistical analyses. My PhD program does require students to take 6 credits of SAS, but I would like to set aside some time to learn more about programming and about data science in general. Assuming my degree takes the traditional four years, would this give me sufficient time to develop skills in Python and R if I set aside five to six hours a week?

I do not have too much longer (started my thesis last month) and I don't really think I have built up quite enough skills to make myself attractive in the job market. As I mentioned before, my lab is quite experimental and there was a certain way to analyze data and produce publication quality graphs that didn't allow me much leeway or time to learn a lot about data science tools. My data sets are also not that large. I know the basics of Python and R, and am quite proficient at Mathematica + MATLAB, but I really need to *show* I can manipulate data. In addition, I have strong interpersonal and communication skills, and my PhD was very diverse so I have been exposed to a very large number of fields. So I have two questions:

1. Does anyone have any tips on projects I can work on to build an online portfolio? 

2. How much do skills outside of coding matter in the data science job market? Skills like communication and critical thinking.

My thought was to insert R as a pre-processing layer between the data storage and the dashboard. At the moment, data is ETL'd locally in power bi and the file size is huge and slow to process. In theory, if I were to ETL using R, I could bring in only the end result data frames and reduce the file size considerably while utilizing the functionality of R.

How would you identify scenic overlooks given an elevation raster?,3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1492098913,True,"Given a grid of points representing elevation, how would you go about identifying the best 'views?'

My thoughts would be that three dimensions need to be combined to get a good ""view"" measure:
* Immediate elevation change, the steeper/taller the better the view
* Distant elevation change, what elevation does the distant landscape change to
* Angle of vision, e.g. how broad can you sweep and still see a ""view""

So, combining all of this with the fact that human vision on earth is limited to ~5km due to curvature I can try to do something like this:

* Draw lines from the point of interest to all of the ""horizon"" points at 5km
* Integrate the difference in elevation along each line, include a scaling factor that is 1 at the point of interest and 0 at the horizon point, this result is the view factor for that line
* Integrate all of the view factors to see how broad of a sweep the view is

In my undergrad years (also as EE) I never really knew what I wanted to do. I got an offer to continue on into the masters program at my school, which I took. It wasn't until the past year I ""discovered"" that I was interested in data science through a class I took, so I took any relevant classes I could at school while finishing my degree. Most of my degree consisted of theoretical classes (optimization, LP, stochastic processes, etc.) that I did not particularly enjoy. I much preferred the more practical/hands-on project-based courses of the couple of data science courses I took.

Well now I'm graduated, and looking for a job like many people are. I look at the requirements for data science jobs and just feel woefully inadequate. If I'm lucky they're asking for only 1-2 years experience, but I look at my data science experience: I took 2 courses focused on data science, and in those courses I completed 4-5 assignments/projects. And that's pretty much it. I feel I'm familiar with many aspects of the field, but no expert in anything. I've looked at data science interview sample questions, and I feel after some studying/review I can at least give some sort of reasonable response for a good number of them. I've taken classes on statistics and probability and dabbled with machine learning algorithms. I have used Python/R but have never used SQL, so I've been spending time trying to sharpen my coding. I read all sorts of blogs and stuff saying you have to know/use github, Hadoop, jupyter, etc. which I have also never used (I did my school projects just using spyder and Rstudio).

I've looked into data science workshops/bootcamps, but I've also heard that programs like Springboard merely compile information/resources you can access online. I've looked into Kaggle competitions and feel overwhelmed. I know I need more experience, so I guess my question is, how much experience are we expected to even have to actually get an interview/job? Should I just go for something like a data analyst just to get some experience before going for a data scientist position further down the line? I've considered internships but the prospects for an advanced-degree grad don't seem to promising.

Advice for a Prospective DS Intern,2,0,False,False,False,datascience,1492193950,True,"Everybody, hope you're having a good day 

CONTEXT: I have an assessment day at a mobile games company coming up, for an internship position. It is a data science/analyst role. Data science because previous projects have involved: 

""Predicting the long-term behaviour of game users from their actions in their first few sessions.
Predicting if a user will lapse from the game according to their recent behaviour.
Modelling a game subsystem or building a simulation to understand player behaviour and optimise the game’s design."" 

the job description says: Significant experience in working in Data Science, including the terminology and techniques that exist for finding insights in large datasets which I interpret as analysing the data created by the userbase of its games to monitor activity.

QUESTION: what do you guys, from your experience, think the questions will be in assessment day? They spoke about AB testing in the interview stage which I have never done before but understand the theory of. 

Also, in your general data science experience and intuition what would be the methods and practices used by data scientists in analysing user activity in games? 
Thanks for any help guys, I really want this internship, it seems like a really cool context to analyse human behaviour, and I want to be as prepared as possible. 

have a good day everybody "
Advice on crafting a resume for Data Science.,5,1,False,False,False,datascience,1492195988,True,"Helllo,

I was wondering if someone could give me advice on what I should do to build a strong resume for a data science position.

Currently, i am finishing my junior year studying Engineering Physics at a the University of Illinois. I always had a knack for numbers, and have thoroughly enjoyed probability and statistics my whole life. Because of this, I decided i want to pursue a data science career. 

Ideally i would have planned on doing this when i first started college, but i didn't realize what i wanted to do until this past winter. This makes me feel a little behind the ball in terms of building a resume. 

I am taking some 400 level statistics courses, along with an intro cs course on java (intended for cs majors so it is relatively in depth and goes over major concepts). 

As of right now I can say i have basic knowledge of java and python along with advanced knowledge in mathematics, physics and statistics. I realize my weak suit is cs skills, and it is something i am working to improve. 

I applied for some internships over this summer, and i heard back from IBM however for various reasons i wasnt able to follow up with the next steps in the process. I also feel that I might be in over my head if i jumped in right now because my cs skills arent as great as they could be ( I can write basic programs and understand the topics i have been taught, i just need more practice to hone my sills).

This summer my plan was to take a course or two at university, while doing a cs project that I can put on my resume and gain further experience. 

Here lies my question. what languages are most valuable that i should make a project in? I can do it in python or java and develop those skills more, or I was thinking I could try and do something in R and get some exposure to that. I basically want to do whatever looks best to put on my resume. 

furthermore, I have some basic ideas of what kind of program i would want to write, but i am not sure if they would be too complex for me at this stage. Could you point me in a direction as to what i should write ( or does it even matter that much to employers?) and what language would be best to practice over this summer so i can try to enter the field next may after i graduate?

If my plan doesnt seem solid and you think there is a better way i could spend my time, i would love to hear it. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and i would really appreciate any advice or guidance to get me closer to my goal and entering the real world.

Dropping out of PhD for a Data Science job - Will I regret it?,57,32,False,False,False,datascience,1492411746,True,"I'm in my 5th year in an engineering PhD program at a top 5 US university. I have an MS from the same university. I have already decided I have no intention of pursuing academia and that industry will be my goal. My research is in statistical learning theory (stability) which I find not really applicable to data science in practice. I was hoping to finish my PhD studies by my 6th year but my advisor and committee told me I needed more results which would take me probably another 2 years. Also, my funding is running out next year which is a big a concern because I'll have to TA which may further slow down my research.

I started interviewing for full-time out of frustration and was surprised when I received two full-time data scientist offers, one of which is at a tech company which I would love to work for. Both places know that I'd intended to withdraw from my PhD. However, I have yet to submit the paperwork to withdraw nor have I informed my advisor because I fear that I am making a long-term mistake.

Will having a PhD benefit me any way in terms of career progression or future opportunities? Most data science managers I've seen have a PhD but I'm not sure this is standard across the industry. Given that I can already obtain a job in data science without a PhD, I'm not sure if the slight bump in compensation is worth another two years of research. I would love to get some thoughts from current data scientists, especially those who faced a similar dilemma.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have done a summer internship as a data scientist (different company from the ones I got the full-time). This experience really solidify my goal to work as a data scientist and how I explained to recruiters about leaving school.

Edit 2: A few people have suggested working and completing my PhD at the same time. I do not think my advisor will sign off on that. I don't think I would have the discipline to follow through even if I do get the approval."

Working as a (non-data science-y) analyst. Next steps?,19,7,False,False,False,datascience,1492440606,True,"Hi r/datascience,
I'd appreciate some guidance/ advise as to what would make the most sense if I wanted to transition into a career in data science.
Some background:

* I graduated an economics major with some math classes under my belt(did fairly well in linear, multivar calc, intro stats and econometrics, intro to real analysis, though most of it went over my head)
* Not sure what I wanted to do after school, so I landed a job as an analyst at an economics consulting firm because it seemed like a good progression from what I did at school
* I've done a variety of research assistant type things at my job and on the technical side my firm doesn't do a lot of high level technical analyses, but I've gotten a chance to do some basic data cleaning and programming. It's all pretty basic stuff especially as an analyst taking instructions, but I like interacting with data and coding things up.
* Fast forward 2 years at this job, there's not much more to learn at my position and I've been thinking more and more about my future career. The most common path is for analysts to get an MBA, but as much as the earning potential after an MBA is tempting, I think I would like being involved in the more technical aspects of analysis. This is when I started looking into data science as a potential career.
* I could possibly aim to get a more quantitative data analyst job with some self study of online courses to increase my programming and technical skills, but as I look through job postings, it seems like most firms want masters or phd graduates for the more interesting data science jobs anyway. I also learn better in a more structured environment.
* So I'm at a dilemma now. I've been toying with the idea of going back to school to get a masters as I'm thinking that grad school would make the most sense now that I'm still relatively fresh out of school. There are all these new data science masters popping up that seem really interesting but at the same time, people seem to be skeptical about their rigor and I would hate to waste a ton of money on an expensive program without much return. On the other hand, I feel like my math/stats background is too weak for a good program in stats (only intro classes). Furthermore, I'm not that interested in the theory aspect of stats, but more the applied part. Is there a grad program out there that is a medium between the two? And will that help me get a job eventually as a data scientist? Or should I just focus on getting my foot into the field as a data analyst and take it from there?"

3. Machine learning
4. Distributed computation frameworks
5. Practical experience

The total amount of time it would take to complete this curriculum is 146 days, considering I would probably take one day off every week, the total would be ~167 days. [Here is a gantt chart I did to estimate it](http://imgur.com/gBcoxGm). _If someone is interested in the spreadsheet with the various entries to adapt the chart to its schedule let me know_.

After the above schedule has been completed I would:

* [Start](https://techbeacon.com/10-influential-data-scientists-why-you-should-follow-them-twitter) [following](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2012/12/most-influential-data-scientists-on-twitter.html) [relevant](https://www.springboard.com/blog/top-data-scientists-on-twitter/) [people](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/top-data-scientists-on-twitter) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/clarecorthell)
* Join Kaggle competitions on my own or [team up with other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/62mfaa/teamup_for_kaggle_competitions/)
* Follow local meetups
* Start listening to DS podcasts (Linear Digressions, Data Skeptic, Talking Machines...)
* Eventually join a datakind.org project
* Eventually follow some more specific course on [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com)

_For each of the above learning blocks I have found other useful resources too that I would consider studying after completing the above schedule. To keep the post short I will not write them here. If someone is interested please let me know and I will share them._

# Questions
1. Is the curriculum well enough structured to give me a solid foundation to start working on some personal/open source projects and start building a portfolio?
2. Did I underestimate the time it would take to complete each book/course (or the total amount of time to complete the #1-19 table)?
3. Would you replace or add any book/course in the above schedule?
4. I would choose Python over R mostly because it can be useful for many other things other than Data Science. Do you think I should start with R or study both from the beginning?
5. If you have **any suggestion** to share I would love to hear them

Purdue Statistics-Computer Science Joint Masters,3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1492558856,True,"Hello,

I'm currently an undergraduate with a computer science major and a statistics minor. My end goal is being a data scientist for a tech company. I've started looking at grad schools and I saw something I hadn't seen before. Purdue has a [joint stats/cs masters program](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/curriculum/statistics_cs.html)

I know a little bit about Purdue CS and that it is very systems heavy (normal requirements are compilers, os, networks), but this program has more of an emphasis on theory and ML classes as well as the opportunity to take databases. 

At the end of my undergraduate I'll have completed coursework in data structures/algorithms, cs theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining(in both stats and eecs department), information retrieval, databases, web databases, probability, regression analysis, and theoretical statistics. 

Most of the courses in this program are graduate versions of undergraduates courses I have taken or will take next year. On one hand it kinds of feels redundant but it seems like a huge amount of the data science positions I see are geared towards someone with an advanced degree. 

Does this program look like something that would be a good preparation to being a data scientist in industry?

Thanks all.

1. do PCA and reduce the features.
2. after doing PCA use K-means algorithm to find the clusters.

I've tried several classification algorithms, without too much fine tuning, just to get a feeling of how the baseline performance was. They all got an accuracy score of around 99%, that is exactly the ratio between class 0 samples and total samples. Artificially under-sampling just got the accuracy score down to the very same ratio of the new dataset, so no improvement on that side.
The F1 score is really bad because I'm experiencing awful Type II errors: basically, the algorithm is just guessing that everything is belonging to class 0. With some models that I tried, it literally predicts everything to be class 0: false positives are 0 (because no positive samples get predicted) and false negatives are really a lot (because actual positives are predicted to be negative). The AUC-ROC curve is around 50% (awful), and weighting the models to take into account the skewness of the classes brought no improvement.
I tried to do some feature engineering (ensembling the supervised classification on top of some unsupervised clustering), with almost no luck.
Do you have any suggestions regarding how to tackle such problems / how to diagnose the underlying issue(s) that prevent(s) the predictor from being accurate? Or I should take this as a proof that, given my dataset, belonging to class 1 is just random (so I should collect more features)?

I feel extremely lost so I thought I would ask you all for help. I do use this platform a lot silently and it has helped me a lot, but I have never posted before. 

A bit about me, I am a 22 year old female, doing my Master's in Electrical Engineering from top University in USA. My original career plan was to follow Signal Processing.  But due to the freedom of choosing courses at my university I was lucky enough to get a Data Science and Signal Processing track and I absolutely fell in love with Data. 

So I ended up taking courses like Probability, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning etc. 

Now I am an international student here and ideally I should have a summer internship. I have applied wide and far, to more than 100+ internships. I am not even hearing back from them. I have lost hope for this summer because the deadline to submit my internship offer letter at my university is soon approaching (May 12th). 

I code in Python, and I will admit that I am not as fast as a traditional CS Student. However, I do write decent code, eventually. We never got enough exposure to programming in EE, during my bachelors back home in India. I have done a lot of projects (Kaggle, coursework etc) and have worked up on my Mathematics and Statistics. 

I know I am extremely hard-working and can adapt and learn really fast. I am just waiting for that one opportunity to click. I am scared too because I have already taken the leap of faith. I have spent $$$$ on this Master's and have abandoned my EE path. 

It seems almost impossible to crack Data Science without work experience, and I need some work experience to get started. How do I land an opportunity and prove my worth! 

Please any help, any advice, anything that steers my rocky boat in the right direction would greatly appreciate it. I want someone to believe in me and give me that chance :(

I hold a phd in civil engineering (properly: modeling of concrete structures, but somewhat close so https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mechanics ), but I do not see a good demand for my skills where I live (southern Italy, but Italy in general). 


At the moment I also should learn real structural design on the job, since my competences are mainly theoretical. Generally I search for a job in europe, but the only foreign language I know is English (and very little Spanish).


It appears 'data science' jobs are in great demand. Let's say I could be comfortable in modeling, processing of data and consultancy.
I started thinking about it 1 year ago when just out of curiosity I took a machine learning course on coursera. Found it pretty easy and enjoyable (still I know those are kind of watered-down versions). Now I am taking a statistics course.


Given all this do you think it may be possible to find a job in data-science? What kind of positions may I look for to grow professionally?

I know there would be A LOT to learn, but smalls steps are doable if the market really requests data scientist in the mid-term. Any advice is welcome.

I've been doing a bit of research on what Data Science really is, as I was quite clueless before. To preface, I have a good knowledge of C and fairly good knowledge of Python (I've built a couple web crawlers and smallish scripts/petty programs for fun). So I have a somewhat decent grasp of programming but I know data science is a whole different ballgame.

I really want to do my best to not be the incompetent newbie who'll need everything explained to him(although I'm sure I'll still need alot to be explained) but I would like to have some miniscule advantage where I could at least say ""Oh, I've learned a bit about that"" so I'm not completely clueless. Basically, what books van I read, what projects can I work on, what software or languages should I learn, so my supervisor can look at me and say ""hey this kid's done his homework."" 

I'd contact my supervisor directly to ask him ahead of starting this internship but the recruiter told me they'd give me that info a few weeks before the job starts in early June. So in the meantime I'd like to get a leg up,if possible, and I was hoping maybe sone fellow data scientists/supervisors could tell me what they'd recommend a new recruit to do/learn.

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you.

This is yet another ""advice"" thread, so please bear with me...

**Background**
BS in Molecular Biology with some academic research experience(2-3ish yrs) and now I'm racking up some industry experience (<1yr). I mostly deal with wet lab and do some data management/analysis (in-house software). 

**Goal**
I would like to move towards a data analytics position and hopefully, later on, fall into a data science career. My relevant knowledge/skills comprise some statistics with R (statistical tests, visualization), python (scripting, data analysis, scraping) and some machine learning knowledge (basic use of sklearn to train models).

**Advice**
I'd like to know what you guys think about the nanodegree programs at Udacity, particularly the Data Analytics program. Obviously, an advanced degree (MS/PhD; thinking about statistics/biostats) would be preferred, but it seems more profitable, thinking in terms of financial and time investment aiming for an entry level position as a data analyst (of course, this is IF and only IF I can jump onto a data analyst path afterwards).

I am leaning towards the Applied Economics as its an actual research degree (Thesis based) since my first my current Master's degree is a terminal degree (Course work). 

The Data Analytics degree has a lot of the Math that I need, but the Applied Economics program will also go over a lot of the same Math that I need but in a more applied manner."
Python vs R,90,25,False,False,False,datascience,1493223571,True,"I have recently expanded my small amount of knowledge from R modeling and plotting to Python. This is mostly out of curiosity for why people choose one over the other. I believe in the past I have heard that each have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to data science. Being only 1 year out of undergrad I am curious what others think between the 2 avenues for analysis. 

What I have found so far:

1. Python is much more explicit when it come to basic graph parameters(which is more tedious, but makes it more malleable). This being said, both Python and R can make gorgeous plots.

2. Python is simple when slicing and filter data-frames for analysis; and scaling, binning, transforming is quick and easy. (not to say R is much harder, but it seems pandas and sklearn.preprocessing have some stronger muscles to flex)

3. R is quick and easy to create regression models, but becomes a bit maddening when it comes to machine learning packages (Neural Network in particular seems more complicated than it's worth.)


Do you think this is correct?


Side question: This may be a small syntax annoyance, but for a new data dude it made a difference: importing packages from R is so simple ""library(x)"" & python importing can be layers of imports. Do people just memorize these???"
MS in Data Science/Analytics should be treated like MBAs (by applicants),17,3,False,False,False,datascience,1493229338,True,"We see a lot of posts on this subreddit about which masters in data science/analytics they should apply to, and how to choose between them and a traditional masters degree in economics/computer science/statistics/OR/applied math. 

First things first: at every masters program in this world, what you learn and how well you learn it is not nearly as important for your job prospects as the quality of the ""stamp of approval"" that you are receiving, i.e., the perceived value of the degree itself.

The more traditional the field, the more programs there are out there with legitimate street cred.

For math, statistics, physics, there are going to be a LOT of programs that carry weight. That is in part because these programs tend to be very demanding, but also because they have had a long time to get established. When looking at resumes, if I see that someone has a masters in statistics, I am not super concerned about where they got it from. A bit, but not super concerned.

Engineering, computer science, OR, etc., are going to be a bit more reduced in the number of programs that are considered legit. The areas are a bit newer, there has traditionally been less interest for MS and PhD grads in these areas (though it's changing), so there is a smaller concentration of programs that are worth their salt. If I'm looking at someone with a MS in computer engineering, I'm looking for a top 25 program at least. 

Then you get into these new programs. Masters in advanced analytics. Masters in data science. Masters in analytics. Masters in data modeling. Whatever they may be, these are all normally programs that have been born in the last 10 years. They normally don't have the same level of academic rigor because they are being born out of demand in the field for people with this specific skillset, so it's actually more important to graduate people and get them out there than it is to arm them with legitimate knowledge of the underlying science part of data science.

That is not to say that these are bad programs, but a) they don't carry the same weight as their more traditional counterparts among hiring managers, and b) there is a much smaller set that are considered to be worthwhile.

Because of that, I think these newer types of MS degrees should be treated a lot like MBAs; That is, an MBA is only really worth getting if it's from a top, elite program. 

Getting an MBA from, I don't know, Kansas State is not likely to do a whole lot for your career. I would say that [top 25](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings) at most is worth the money, and I would argue that there are huge dropoffs after 7 (Berkeley), 12 (NYU,Duke), and 18 (UNC).

I feel the same way about Masters of Data Science/Analytics/etc programs. Using[ this ranking](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/schools/top-masters-in-analytics/) (don't really care which one you want to use), by the time you get to 15, you are really starting to lose steam. 

Just one man's opinion, but with how many questions there are about this, I think it was worth bringing up. What do you think?"
How to calculate how many rows of data my firm is using...,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1493231635,True,"I am shopping some commercial ETL, Warehousing and BI tools and I've narrowed it down to a few contenders for each function. Most of their pricing is based on rows or events, and I know we don't have a lot of data in the context of other firms (we have 12 employees) but I couldn't give you an accurate quantitative estimate of how many rows/events of data we're actually dealing with. 

I know how many web properties we're running GA for, how many ecom store fronts we are operating, facebook ads running, etc., so I'm sure if I understood what all those numbers roughly translated to I could find the number of rows/events and calculate pricing for these services.

Discussion thread: dedicated server for personal projects!,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1493232093,True,"I recently rented a [Hetzner EX41S](https://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex41s) to perform various data science tasks (mostly text processing and training of non-deep-learning classifiers).

I've found that doing data science on cloud machines often stresses me out, because I obsess over how long the machines are up, and the process of loading/unloading the data is more expensive. Getting a private server has definitely alleviated that pressure, since it's overall cheaper.

This particular server has 64GB DDR4 RAM, and the processor is ""Intel Core i7-6700 
 Quad-Core Skylake incl. Hyper-Threading Technology"".

I went for this because the limitation on my laptop was often memory, so I thought, why not get a machine with a lot of RAM? But I'm quickly finding that the datasets that fit in this sweet spot between 16GB and 64GB of RAM (and more importantly, can be vectorized/processed/etc in that same amount) is not very big.

So what does the ""Pareto front"" look like for you, in terms of cost and specs for a data science machine? What would you optimize for?"

Here's a scenario:

I'm a successful youtuber who has a significant amount of subscribers and a few marketing partnerships.  There may even be products or services that I offer to able to support myself.

The problem is that I found that my subscription numbers have been growing increasingly slower, and with some analysis I find that I've saturated a high percentage of my market.  In order to continue my growth, I decide that I need to increase my visibility by appealing to a market where I would get the most new viewers, and that collaborating with another youtuber would be a great opportunity to do so.

My proposal: Hypothetically, let's say I have a dataset of all users' subscriptions and built a network of accounts that are connected by users that are subscribed to common channels.  I was thinking that with that, I can search for another account that has a high centrality with a weak tie, so that its users do not overlap with my saturated user base.

There are other elements that are a part of this model that make it less abstract, but is there something inherently incorrect about this?  Thanks

Breaking into data science out of undergrad,21,6,False,False,False,datascience,1493274695,True,"Hey, guys! I'm a freshman at Rutgers University, double-majoring in Finance and Business Analytics & IT (BAIT - similar to MIS, except with a bigger focus on statistics,) and I've recently discovered my passion for data science. 

I've pursued this by mastering many aspects of Python, R and SQL (some of which my major, BAIT, goes into, but the rest of which does not,) and am most recently taking Kirill Eremenko's Udemy course on Machine Learning. After completing this and obtaining the certificate, I plan to familiarize myself with descriptive and inferential stat theory, as well as Spark and Scala.

My only concern is that I won't be able to break into the field right out of college. I've taken the most relevant major possible (double major in CS and stats would be more obvious, but more of this is theory than any real application to data - BAIT comes close to that,) and am doing everything I can with MOOCs, but will that be enough of an analytical background? Is there any way at all that I could become a data scientist at 22?

However, I've been thrown a bit of a curve ball. Due to some restricted project going into the lab space I work in, I will lose access to my experiment this June. My advisor is sympathetic, and since there's really no way for me to work around this issue he's prepared to just graduate me in July with my thesis as-is. 

The problem is, I'll have a full plate between now and then trying to grab some final data in a rush and writing my thesis.

TLDR : I'm currently a Software Engineering BS at RIT minoring in Applied Statistics. I'm debating grabbing a MS in Applied Statistics and/or Computer Science after I graduate (probably also at RIT). To work as a Data Scientist, I assume it would be better to get the App Stats exposure? Would a PhD be mandatory, or would a MS suffice?

A couple of questions, if anyone is willing to answer them...

1. It seems like it's required to hold some sort of graduate degree to obtain a job as a 'data scientist'. What is the difference between a data scientist, an analyst, and an engineer? It seems as if the lines between those occupations are fuzzy, as the skills seem to consistently overlap.

2. I'll be taking some higher level Stats classes, namely [Design of Experiments](https://www.rit.edu/science/sites/rit.edu.science/files/COS-STAT-325-DesignOfExperiments-WI.pdf),[Mathematical Statistics I](http://ccrg.rit.edu/~whelan/courses/2015_3fa_STAT_405/), and [Non-Parametric Statistics](https://www.rit.edu/science/sites/rit.edu.science/files/COS-STAT-345-NonparametricStatistics.pdf). I'm hoping to also take Introduction to Intelligent Systems (a Computer Science class focusing on Machine Learning) and Introduction to Data Mining (also a CS class). Would these be worth taking? If not, are there any Stats/CS classes that you would recommend?

3. In regards to Math, I haven't yet taken DiffEq and MultiVar but I've been doing self learning (I don't know whether or not that will be sufficient). I've already taken Linear and Discrete. Should I take these formally? Also, are there any math topics (besides basic linear and calc) that those of you who are data scientists use on daily basis? I have a good idea from what I've seen here, on kaggle and related sites, and from doing my own research/reading, but I'd appreciate a recommendation from someone who actually works with data on a daily basis.

4. I'll also have this summer completely free. I'm planning on doing a lot of work with the kaggle datasets and doing independent learning in regards to math/stats concepts. Would you have any suggestions about resources, projects, or anything else that I could use / do / look at during that time?

Last note, as a Software Engineer, I am already intimately familiar with Python, C, and C++. I can always improve upon that, but I'm not very concerned about programming and/or technological proficiency right now.

I apologize for the (probably) inane questions, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of clear information in regards to a lot of these issues.

Does it sound like my goals are actually what a data scientist does or have I misunderstood?

Any input would be greatly appreciated.  I am willing to learn more code. I would like to avoid having to add a major or minor this late, but if that is my only option then so be it.  If you want any more clarification, then please feel free to ask.

Need help evaluating a job offer (details inside) (x-post from /r/cscareerquestions),11,2,False,False,False,datascience,1493464259,True,"**About me**:


* Bachelor (small unknown private school) and Master (top 20 school) in biomedical subjects. 
* Currently finishing Master (decent EU university) in applied mathematics/computational engineering. 
* Two years biomedical research experience. 
* Two data science/machine learning internships at large companies (1 traditional tech, 1 pharma company).
* Finishing my thesis. 
* Need money (but I can hold out) and anxious to get some real full time experience in machine learning under my belt. 
* I do not have the DS & A background that is required for most technical interviews so I would need to fix that in order to be successful for other interviews.



**The offer**: 

* Non-tech, scientific publishing company as an entry level software engineer, with this position being based in Philadelphia.
*  I'd be working on a ""hot"" machine learning team within the company that is apparently high visibility.
* Manager seems really great and the others I have talked to are really nice. 
* Salary offer is in mid 60K, which I think is quite low even for Philly.



**Pros**: 

* Work with cutting edge technology, with awesome datasets. 
* More importantly will need to develop scalable projects. 
* Good work-life balance. 
* High visibility. 
* Combines both of my backgrounds. 
* Stable company. 
* Company lets me finish my thesis while working.



**Cons**: 

* Low Pay (ok for now, but will this haunt me down the road?). 
* Located in a non-tech city (limits available career opportunities/need to start personal life over if/when I do move on). 
* Company is trying to transition from an old business model, so other parts of the company will be a bit archaic, not ""cutting edge""



**My questions**:

* Should I just go and grab quick experience doing meaningful and technically challenging work? 
* Would it be a better idea to hold out and gamble to see if something better comes along? 



**Additional Info**: 

* I live in a pretty cool city right now and wouldn't mind staying here for a few more months, but the financial situation is kind of tight and I would like to work in a ""real"" job. 
* Also the process seemed almost ""too easy"", am i just being paranoid about that?

The paper describes using a skipgram model to feed into the neural network with window sizes of 5 and 10.  Here are my results so far:

no-skipgrams: ~92.4%
skipgram with window=5: ~90.6%
skipgram with window=10 ~ 1.67% ???

I'm trying to make a decision on how to go about my future career in data science. I've been accepted into 2 master's programs in data science programs at University of Washington and NYU. 

[Washington](https://www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu/)
Not as well known as NYU, but UW has a very solid comp sci program and I have contacted a faculty with which to work with on some AI/computer vision related research. No funding though, just 5k in scholarship aid. Seems to lack in student recruiting compared to NYU's program. Seattle is cheaper compared to NYU though. ($45k)

[NYU](http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-in-data-science/)
More established, high profile program. Was one of my top choices, but is expensive. Excellent faculty on deep learning and AI, which are areas I want to work in. No financial help at the moment, although many current students I've contacted say they work part/full time in NYC while getting their degrees. ($62k)

On top of this, I am currently interviewing for a large tech company in silicon valley (think Google/Apple type) for a data analytics/business type position. I see this as a stepping stone towards a full data scientist gig.

My goal is to work as a data scientist at a large tech company working in deep learning/machine learning. What draws me about the master's programs is the opportunity to conduct research and learn more about statistics and computer science, since that is not my background (aero/mechanical eng). I think it also sets me up better in the long run to work on things I'd like to specialize in, but of course it comes at a cost of 1.5 years of studying and tuition.

Have a BA in economics. Worked the last few years mostly using excel for data manipulation presentation purposes and ACCESS doing queries. From what I've gotten from the job is well more than likely be doing any reports needed and ad box requests. So lots of query stuff I imagine. I would like to hopefully get into the statistical side of things at some point. I took a forecasting class my last semester in college using some program called Winrats(?) if I remember. Basically I don't have a true programming type background but I think I can learn it as I go into my career but I would like to make sure I'm well rounded.

What to learn for a career change on a fixed timeframe?,2,7,False,False,False,datascience,1493699894,True,"Gentlemen, Ladies,

I know this subreddit gets its fair share of career advice questions, so thanks in advance for suffering through one more.

First a little backstory:
I'm European, 31. Studied civil engineering, although after dabbling in that field for a short while, it was clear the civil part was a bad choice for me. My career is in hydrography. which means I basically hang out on boats and collect and process 3D point data for offshore projects. This involves the technical bits, troubleshooting, cleaning data, etcetera. When it comes to relevant experience in this job for programming/data science: let's say the stats used rarely are harder than means and medians, and every now and then I'd write a VBA thing to sift through some sensor data.
I've also always been a computernerd, happy to be creative with computers in all sorts of ways, especially with graphic design and 3D modeling software when I was younger. Though I never took programming seriously, I was always quick with it, had a kid's programming language called Superlogo when I was 8, was obsessed with bettering my mIRC for a while doing all sorts of scripting. But of course, never learned it properly. Maths was also always my favorite in shcool, so hey, design, programming, maths, I guess my interests are starting to point in a certain direction ;)

Having been on the lookout for a career change for a while, I decided last year to start taking programming seriously. I have since learned some web development, which I'd like to avoid because of the immature hipster clusterfuck that is JavaScript, and mainly python, which I've started to use in all kinds of ways both at work and for personal things. I realized python and databases tickled my fancy, so I started exploring the realm of data science more. I'm currently halfway through a Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, so I know some R, SQL, MongoDB, etc already as well.

Now we come to my dilemma! At the moment I live in South America with my fiance, and I'm really not fond of leaving her behind many more times to go do boat work. Because I'm also already 31, I'd like to take a leap sooner rather than later.

Where we live is also a terrible place for wages as well as opportunities, so we will move to Europe around time of the wedding early 2018. All this means that I can't start a new career until we move, and I can't afford to not start one once we get there.

Basically, I need to take the path that has the highest probability of putting me at a computer for a company upon arrival. Now, when I look at my learning path, heavenly interesting as it looks, I feel like I'm spreading myself too thin to make this goal a reality. It's got all sorts of math books, stats, more python, R, SQL, low level programming, visualization libraries, algorithms, etcetera etcetera. But honestly, I think my study plan as it is now will take me longer than I want to wait to change careers.

I'm wondering, since I'm actually partial to the programming side of things, if it wouldn't improve my chances a lot to focus on a much narrower area. I.e. pick a language and become a pure developer, rather than learning a bit of everything related to data science. I'm actually excited these days about learning a compiled language like C# or C++, so I'm wondering if it would be a better idea to just focus on that, and steer my career to data after I've transitioned from boatguy to computerguy. If I want to at least.

Hoping people in the industry can give me some advice on my dilemma here.

Seriously, thanks if you made it this far, and I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions.

My background is in medicine and Comp Sci bachelors, and I have an MD (meaning med school grad, no residency, long-story short I earnestly felt I could be a better fit in CS+medicine), so I feel like this is my next logical step - to enter into data science in Healthcare. And then onto /r/machinelearning to get myself ready for future.

But what they promise sounds too good to be true. Are they super intensive? Is it hard to get in? Their whitepaper doesn't go in deep and I'm not seeing a lot of reviews on their webpage.


Thanks!

"SQL/SQL Certification: Where do I start, what should I do, and why?",19,24,False,False,False,datascience,1493832229,True,"Hello Reddit,

I'm looking for some advice, and there is no shortage of that on the internet, I hear.  I hate reading long posts, so I'll try to keep mine short.  I'll just say who I am and what my situation is, and what I want to do.  Looking for advice on how to get there.

**Who I am:**  I have an MS in statistics.  I currently work as a data scientist at a medium-size consulting firm.  I'm very early in my career (I'm 26, about a year out of grad school).  My work involves me coding in R pretty much all day (for some projects I am unfortunately forced to work in Stata).  I've hit a wall, though.  I consider myself pretty much an expert in R.  (Everyone defines ""expert"" differently.  What I mean is, there isn't much functionality left in R that I have left to learn or care about.)  My work also involves running my scripts in parallel on an AWS server.  While my company does not use it, I am also pretty familiar with Python as a data science tool.

**What I'm looking to do:** I'm constantly trying to expand my knowledge and increase my skills to make me a more well-rounded ""data scientist"" (I love this highfalutin term, but when I started studying statistics it didn't even exist yet).  While my company does not need or use this skill very much (yet), I have my sights set on learning the intricacies of SQL.  My company will also pay for any certification exams I want.  So I began gearing towards getting Oracle SQL certified (Exam 1Z0-071).  I started looking into Oracle because it seems to be the gold standard in DBA.  However, a coworker recently told me that Microsoft also offers their own forms of SQL certification.  I'm not entirely sure what the differences are in terms of exam content or certification prestige.  Upon doing some cursory research, it also looks like Microsoft's T-SQL has some sort of integration with R (my mother tongue!), which really appeals to me.  Integration with R would also be something that would make my company more enthusiastic to let me pursue this skill.

**So:** What should I do?  And where should I start?  Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance, Reddit!"

What is a typical deliverable due at the end of a sprint?,3,3,False,False,False,datascience,1493863562,True,"I'm interested in knowing what each sprint is like (as opposed to knowing what your day-to-day activities are).  Does each sprint require you to present a new supervised/unsupervised learning algorithm to the team and answering why you chose that algorithm over another?  Or is each sprint an incremental improvement to the current system?  Is it a lot more rigorous than this?

Reason why I'm asking is because I'm currently padding my resume for applications to data science/NLP positions with projects, and for the most part, I'm not really making any progress with my current project (second project) in topic modelling.  I've applied two different clustering algorithms without any results that show improvement in overall clusters.  Data cleaning and preprocessing was already done to the data, it's just the actual clustering that's not working.  So for the past few days I've worked on something only to show that these two algorithms aren't the best choice (of course I can also be wrong with my implementation or interpretation of the results).  I'm just scared that work would be like this and I'd be unable to deliver at the end of a sprint (or several if I had to do this exact problem)."

Hi,

Unfortunately some parts of the heatmaps are fuzzy and it gets worser with normalization.

Variability of a 1 dimensional signal: can we rely on PCA?,6,2,False,False,False,datascience,1493910734,True,"Hello all,


I have some 1 dimensional signals and I would like to use these signals (X1, X2, X3...) to predict an associated measures Y. I figured that maybe I could use the variability/complexity of these signals (I know there is a difference but I am still in the exploratory step) before applying a model to these data (i.e. transforming X1, X2, X3... before).


So if I remember I read somewhere (but cannot figure out where) that one could use PCA to assess if a signal is more or less complex. My logic would be as follow:


- segment my signal X1 in little part (for instance 100);

- apply a PCA on the 100 samples of the signal X1;

- find 100 (or 99) components. Then go back to the signal and see how many components are need to reach a good % of variance explained. Therefore I transform my signal X1 into series of values (here 100) describing how many components would be needed to reconstruct these segment (to an acceptable level). The idea is that highly variable signal surely need more components.


Well I do not know if this method exists and if it is applicable. If anyone can help thank you!!"

 - Image/rules of The decision tree model **after** pruning with 50% training, 50 % testing.
  - Its precision, accuracy and recall.

and then increase the training and decrease the testing. Then analyze and discuss the results about which attributes that are most likely to classify a binge drinker.

Thanks a bunch.

There are so many things wrong with this blog post, I barely know where to start, but that's never stopped me before. Let's break this down a bit, shall we?

*Data scientists are creative and bring disruptive IP (intellectual property), and this can cause havoc for their company*


That's why I hired them.


*They can steal and leverage your IP, and create IP leaks.*


Which is why companies have a general counsel.


*Are not great communicators, and sometimes can be stubborn*


So you hired cats?


*Work on stuff that they like, even if it does not translate in yield, or if it is not stuff they are paid to do*


No managers on staff?


*Hate doing mundane work, and are bad at it*


They are way too expensive to have them doing mundane work anyway. Hire cheaper people for that.


*Have more career options than many employees, and are thus difficult to retain*


Pay them appropriately, challenge them often, and manage them well.


*Don't like team work,*


Mine are brilliant at team work. Perhaps hire better?


*Tend to be elitist and isolationist*


Hire better.


*Are sometimes very attached to a specific technology and don't want to try something different (they sometimes give the impression that they haven't realized the world is evolving without them)*


Are you sure you hired data scientists?


*Are not good listeners*


Seriously? Most of the ones I run across are some of the most thoughtful listeners I've ever worked with. That's how they learn from each other.


*Work for you just to save enough money to launch their company and compete with you in a couple of years*


Then my company needs an ass-kicking. If they aren't going to do it, our competitors sure as hell will.


*Are arrogant: bad impact on teams*


I'd rephrase this as ""Are smart: should probably be listened to""


*Think sales, marketing and executives are stupid*


Ummm (just kidding). If they ignore the science and go with their gut ""just because"", I'd argue that they are.


*Can do real nasty stuff if they become a disgruntled employee*


I hope you don't have any DBAs on staff then, or you're screwed. 


*Are sometimes reluctant to share their knowledge, train colleagues, or outsource to colleagues*


While some of the points have a small whiff of truth at times, I have never ever ever experienced this.


*Are not great at prioritizing*


This one is actually pretty true in some cases. This is why you hire managers.


*Are not great at switching (on-demand) from one task (coding) to another (presenting)*


I think it's more a matter of some not being able to present well to a broader audience. This is eminently trainable in almost all cases.


*Sometimes have issues working with women (especially managing or being managed by women), especially if coming from a male-dominant culture*


One third of my team are women (I'd be fine if it were higher), so I don't see this in practice.


I'm sure that there are some data scientists for which some of the above might be true. Given that, at-will employment is pretty much the default these days, so it's just not that hard to fire their ass and replace them with one of the many excellent data scientists in the world. I think the blogger's beef should be with bad managers instead."

"
Not sure how to conduct a Deal Score assignment,4,3,False,False,False,datascience,1494263732,True,"I work for a company that posts lots of deals in a daily basis. Some deals are profitable, others are not and there is a break-even value that represents a profitable deal when it is crossed.


I have this crazy idea to score the deals based on some features in order to estimate which one is more likely to be a good one for us to have in our website.


Based on this I have a few questions:


1) Is it possible at first?

2) I am thinking about using a correlation function to discover which features has a direct influence in sales. Is this a good approach?

3) I don't know which ML algorithm I should use because I don't want to simply label/classify the deals as ""Profitable""/""Not profitable"". I want it to have a score. What should I use in this situation?


I work with Business Intelligence for quite a long time but I am just getting into this world of Data Science (ML, classification, regression, etc), and thats why it might be a simple question. I am doing my best! By the way, I am more familiar with Python...

Detecting External Influencers on Reddit,11,24,False,False,False,datascience,1494268229,True,"Just looking for a bit of discussion here around how to detect marketing accounts on reddit.

I have recently started using the reddit API for this purpose on my local subreddit. The naive approach has been to look at a specific subreddit's top 100 posts by day. From these I gather some stats about the first 5 users who comment: average account age, average # interactions on the subreddit, average karma. 

Then I look at a suspicious post's user stats to see if it has any obvious outliers. The idea being that marketing companies will buy accounts with history to upvote and interact, but these users won't have a history on a given sub. 

I can see a lot of obvious problems with this, but it does seem to show anomalies for some suspicious posts.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what else to look for in a marketing account? A source for obvious marketing accounts would be welcome too. I think a machine learning algorithm (MLPClassifier?) could probably handle this well, but I have no idea how to create the training data."

I am currently a (junior) Remediation Project Manager for a state environmental agency. I could be a PM my whole life but would like to further my career and learn more about data science/computer science and apply statistical analysis to environmental science.
____
I graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science and have only taken several classes that utilized computing:


 ▪ Matlab - Computing for Engineers 

 ▪ R-Studio - Statistics / Numerical Analysis
 
 ▪ Python – Environmental Data Analysis / GIS

 ▪ Arduino (C/C++) - Undergraduate Research Position

These courses taught me the syntax and how to program for certain applications, but I missed out on all the CS theory, data structures, algorithms, logic, etc.  
____

So my questions are:

1)	I am currently taking a course with DataCamp (Data Scientist with Python Track)

 ▪ Is this a good starting point?

2)	Should I also take the Introduction to Computer Science with HarvardX/edX

 ▪ Will this teach me the theory or is the DataCamp course good enough?

 ▪ Is there a better way (online certificate/post-bacc in CS, Computer Engineering, Applied Statistics)?

3)	Any data scientists here with a specialization in the environmental field?

 ▪ What was/is your career track?

 ▪ What is my best option given my current career track as a Project Manager?


Thanks!

New to Data Science - questions about day to day stuff,3,4,False,False,False,datascience,1494448985,True,"(*) When it comes to the coding you do for your DS role, is it for the purposes of just obtaining data, or are you writing/developing apps for the organization you're working for?  I'm trying to get an idea of the extent and purpose of programming. 

(*) What tools are most common (if such a distinction can be made).  Are you guys using BusinessObjects/Tableu type of products, or cranking through stuff with SPSS/Excel?  I guess I'm asking if the tools like BOBJ/Tableau are used in the 'real' world (as they're supposed to make Data Science analysis 'easy'), or is that really just marketing fluff.

I've got 100 more questions, but am trying to keep this light (for now).  

For some reference, I am a mid-40's employee, who has worked in the software industry for 20+ years (18 of which is with the same company).  I have an undergrad minor in Computer Science, and an MBA with an MIS specialization...this is all to say that I am technically minded, but not a developer.  Any development experience I had is old, but given some time, I'd be able to ramp back up.  (For example, I'm able to roll up my sleeves to do BS projects around the house).

At the moment, I am considering a MS Comp Sci / Data Science degree, with the intent of moving into a Data Science role - ideally with my current organization.  However, before I commit, I want to get a good feeling for what the day-to-day is like.  

I have a passion for data, specifically for statistics, unfortunately, it's not something I do as part of my current job...my intent is to finally chase after something I am interested in, rather than let the needs of my organization dictate my career.

So, I guess I am trying to figure out if moving into the DS world is actually the interesting world that I think it is, and do I have (or can I develop) the technical chops needed to be successful.  "

I am currently a Junior in college. I transferred about 2 years ago from a community college where I graduated with an Associates in Network Security. Unfortunately my college does not offer a similar program, so it took me a year to figure out whether I wanted to pursue a degree in Computer Science or Information (data) Science. I went with Information Science because I felt that the field is more practical and an upcoming field for many tech companies.

Currently, I am learning Python and this Summer I will have a lot of free time between working at a restaurant and not not doing much. I wanted to know from professionals if there are any industry certifications that I could work towards to better my resume for internships for next year. Like Cyber Security, there is A+, Network+, Security+. I've taken the classes for those and I plan to take the Network+ exam at some point this year since I've already paid for the exam voucher. But I'd like any advice possible for industry certifications I should look into that will better my knowledge in the field.

Also, I am a real estate agent too ( got my license my freshman year of college ) and I really enjoy aspects of finance and real estate modeling. I'm hoping to find a company that allows me to work with both finance or real estate and also aspects of Python. I'm local in the Maryland area, close to D.C. and Baltimore, so if you have any suggestions for jobs or internships too that would be awesome!

Now, I got my first summer internship at a insurance brokerage to help them implement data analytics. The thing Is I have no one there to mentor me, since I'm the only one there with some knowledge of it.

I think there is a lot of potential at this firm, since they don't use any data analysis yet. I've researched some interesting projects to start with, but I don't know if I will be capable of doing it:

- identify new customers
- understanding customer needs
- product development 
- risk selection / pricing
- marketing
- insurer selection

Language to define a metric?,2,3,False,False,False,datascience,1494513561,True,"Hi all, 

Not sure if this is the right place for this so please let me know if you think it should go somewhere else. 

I'm working on habit building software one of the key pieces of early feedback I'm getting is that the way goals for habits are defined is confusing. 

The problem comes from having two attributes to the habit:

1. The completion goal: The # of days a week you would like to complete the habit. 

2. The habit target: If the habit you are tracking is scalar, (ie. weight, or # of pushups), the # you want to be below or above each day. E.g., I might want to do more than 10 push ups each day and want to be able to record the # of pushups that I do each day. 

This distinction is necessary for the function of the app and to be on par / exceed competitors. 

The way this is currently explained both in the interface and in the initial walkthrough (that is also available at any time by clicking a button on the interface) is visible here: http://imgur.com/a/NIg9z

So the question is, are there better terms to refer to each of the 2 parts of that habit goal? I've been doing some research using google and reddit but having a hard time avoiding information on the metric system which isn't relevant. Any suggestions, places to look or suggested reading would be extremely helpful.

My current thinking is to simplify by changing:

1. from Completion Goal to Target Weekly Frequency

2. from Target to Target Value

Although I think thats still too confusing. 

Any and all thoughts welcome, thank you. "

"Masters in Data Science, Analytics, or Applied Stats?",6,2,False,False,False,datascience,1494531265,True,"Hi all,

I'm currently working as an analyst, and I want to make sure I don't remain stagnant in my career, so I'm considering going back for my masters.   I'm considering programs like these:

[NJIT MS Applied Stats](http://math.njit.edu/academics/graduate/ms-appliedstatistics/)

[Penn State MS Applied Stats](http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/applied-statistics-masters/overview)

[Georgia Tech MS Analytics](https://pe.gatech.edu/online-masters-degrees/online-master-science-analytics)

[NJIT MS Software Engineering](http://catalog.njit.edu/graduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/software-engineering-ms/)

I'm trying to figure out, which would set me up to further my career as an analyst, or in the data science field.  I'm leaning towards Applied Stats because I feel like most of these Analytics and Data Science degrees are cash grabs with very little in the way of meaningful coursework.  For example, UC Berkeley has a program with an Intro to Python course.  That one class hardly seems worth almost $7k.  I'm a little more confident about Georgia Tech's program because their Online Masters in CS has seemed pretty solid.

Does it make sense to go for the Applied Stats degree as a way of sort of ""futureproofing"" my degree so to speak?  Spending money to earn a degree learning things like Python, R, and Tableau seems like it could get dated pretty quickly, and those are things I teach myself for the most part.

The reason I'm looking at Applied Stats and not pure Stats is because I have an Econ undergrad degree and lack a lot of the undergrad coursework for a pure Statistics degree.  The admissions for an Applied Stats degree seem to be a little more lenient.  I also don't want to have to go back and take additional undergraduate courses, as my company won't pay for undergrad courses, but will pay for the Masters courses.  

Any help is appreciated! "

At this point in time I figured I wasn't going to get into Rice either so I committed myself to just working another year and trying again next year. I stumbled across the Texas A&M Online MS program which I could do part time what I work, which looks highly intriguing, but as fate would work itself out, I was accepted into Rice University this morning. So I'm asking for an opinion on those who have either gone through the program or have been in a similar situation, am I missing out on an incredible opportunity if I decide to bypass this offer, stay in Los Angeles and get an online M.S? Or is this one of those things regardless of everything else, I should probably go? One thing to note is that while I would still have to take some debt, if I did the A&M program it would be cheaper and I would still be working so me paying off school would be much less of an issue than going to Rice, where room and board would be taken care of, but everything else would have to come out of pocket.

I have always thought that at some point in life I would be able to run my own small/medium company and I was wondering if this would be a viable option as a data scientist.

The question may sound stupid (or it actually is, help me) but the reason why I am asking this is because I feel that as a medium experienced software developer it would be somehow _easy_ to ""just have the right idea"" and mock a prototype software/web app/mobile app to showcase to investors.

On the other side I see data science as a key department in medium/big companies but I find it difficult to think of a medium experienced data scientist starting off his company by, at least initially, leveraging only his own skills. I'd rather think of a senior data scientist running a company based on some cutting edge technology.

I hope this all makes sense. I'm just trying to balance my current desire to get into data science with what I think would be my _ultimate goal_ of running my own small company.

[Hiring] The Liverpool Big Data Science (LIVDAT) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) | UK PhD studentships in big data analytics for the physical sciences [x-post /r/bigdatajobs],0,4,False,False,False,datascience,1494753168,True,"Hi folks,

I hope this is of interest to some here. Please forgive some of the advertising language in what follows, as I'm paraphrasing a little from promotional materials.

A new collaborative venture between the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University in the UK has just got underway. The Liverpool Big Data Science (LIVDAT) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) is a hub for training students in managing, analysing and interpreting large, complex datasets (an/or high flow rate data) from the physical sciences.

The CDT promises a unique training approach addressing challenges in data intensive science to tackle a growing skills gap. It will provide training in Big Data science to a cohort of ~20 *fully funded* PhD students, starting October 2017, to create future leaders in data intensive science. The projects will address R&D challenges in astronomy, nuclear, particle and accelerator physics and involve Monte Carlo studies, Deep Learning and HPC, as well as Data Analysis.

The new training centre is supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and will be hosted by the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University. It will offer a comprehensive training in data intensive science through cutting edge research projects and a targeted academic training programme, complemented by secondments to national and international partners.

More details can be found [here](http://www.livdat.org). My personal involvement is in the astrophysics side, which is hosted at Liverpool John Moores University. Details specific to those projects can be found [here](http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/newsitem-livdat). I'd be more than happy to chat with any interested parties via PM. The deadline for applications is June 1st 2017."

When it comes to applying for jobs most throw away the scientific method and just do what they've been told: 

Write the typical resume, with the typical cover letter, apply online,  and then beg for a hiring manager to call them. 

 


What if we thought of getting a job as our next data challenge?

What if we first defined out target audience (ex: hiring managers in the health sector), packaged ourselves in order to achieve product market fit by getting constant feedback, found a metric that we want to maximize (ex: # of positive responses from hiring managers), and thought of novel ways to reach our audience. 


 


If we applied the data science methods to our jobs we can uncover our eyes to the infinite options we have.

Citation impact applied to religious literature,2,5,False,False,False,datascience,1494785762,True,"x-post from r/MachineLearning/6b42xt

***

A friend asked me a question: The book has some many stories, which are the most relevant?
This made me wonder if this question has been approached with data-driven methods.

For scientific papers, there are citation impacts. 
There is a source, and the number of references to it.

Could a simular method be used to create a heatmap for the contents of religious books?

***

There is a central node, and secondary nodes. These are related to the central node if there is a citation. If so we have an edge.

In the case of academic papers, this is a straightforward problem.

The central node is static. 
Secondary sources are well defined. Citations (references) are supposed to be explicit & formalized. 
So edges are known and determining them requires no additional calculation.

Religious books are different.

For one they often exist in multiple versions, the source is actually a set of nodes. Historically, this problem has been partially handled by using canons (numerical indexes), which could also help here. There are slight variations in the indexes, but mappings could be created with limited effort. The central node could be a union of indexed versions.

It would be impractical to sort trough all secondary sources.

A rough method could be to look at a large set of pages, and scan each one for an element from a group of keywords, plus an index format. Then check if there is a significant substring match in the page and the related element in central node. If so there is an edge.

Additional impact analysis could be performed by comparing the results from different choises of keywords, or more broadly speaking: categorising the references: sect, language, year, etc...

***

Do you know about existing research in this direction, if so, could you give me a pointer?

Does the approach described above seem sensible? If so, any suggestions which math to use in order to perform the text matching part somewhat efficiently? I'm considering trying this for a small test, say genesis versus wikipedia dump."

Order of tackling a data science problem?,11,5,False,False,False,datascience,1494960221,True,"I'm still somewhat a newbie to the world of data science so I was a little confused when thinking of the following: 

If I had a dataset on which I wanted to perform, lets say classification. I have around 100 features and would like to scale them down using feature selection. I also want to try out different algorithms (Boosted trees, Random Forest, SVM etc.) to see which one performs best on my data with parameter tuning. What is the best order to go about doing this. 

My thoughts were to take each algorithm separately and perform feature selection (using cross validation) and then using the resultant 'best features' tuning the parameters of the algorithm, again using cross validation. I would do this for each algorithm and see which comes out with the best accuracy..... 

Would there be another approach/order to this. Feature selection in some cases can be performed irrespective of the choice of algorithm so I suppose you could start with that and use the resultant features to then follow the above steps?

I guess a TLDR would be: Should feature selection/engineering be performed before algorithm selection/tuning or nested within the model for each algorithm?"

My only issue is that I can't find solutions to the exercises anywhere online. I get that the author wanted students to work them out for themselves... But after working them out for myself, I usually have no idea of whether i'm right or completely off track. 

So does anyone here (or anywhere really) have the solutions to the exercises? If so... would you mind sharing them?

I can kind of accomplish this with Google Prediction API spreadsheet add-on. But I need to do it 1 field at a time by deleting a given serp result and determining what Google thinks it should be.

Quick question on taking a training model and then using it for prediction. 

Assume I have 2 data sets, the first is small and has the truly observed outcome. This data set is also unbalanced (N = 100, Targets = 25, Non-targets = 75). To identify best features, model parameters etc, I am using leave one out cross validation and a balanced cross validation data set approach. This can be summarized as follows: 

     1) Remove 1st observation and down-sample Non-targets to be equal with targets
     2) Train model 
     3) Make prediction on removed observation
     4) repeat steps 1 - 3 100 times to account for sampling variability 
     5) Aggregate prediction votes and classify observation as majority vote

After developing this model and identifying the proper feature, parameter settings etc. I want to apply this to a new data set and classify each observation as Target/Non-target. To do so should I 

A) 

    1) Train model using optimal features/settings on all training data 
    2) Make predictions on second data set using newly trained model

B) 

    1) Train model using optimal features/setting on balanced training set down-sampling Non-targets (same method as above)
    2) Make predictions on second data set
    3) repeat steps 1 and 2 100 times to account for the sampling variability 
    4) Final prediction is based upon the aggregate voting

I wrote a python script that goes through a spreadsheet of crime data in my county and generates a charts for each crime in each town in the county with the current number reported, last month's numbers, percent change, etc.

I've written various other scripts that go through large amounts of data (phone records, bank records, etc.) and make it uniform and readable or pulls out relevant information (e.g. the dates of all transactions over $3,000 if we're looking at a drug dealer's bank records)

This is a brand new project, but I'm trying to make a tool that detects whether or not Tweets from a given geographical area have gang-related content and records the ones that do.

I could look at the average number of ads/day a user sees just to get a metric of average time online.  I could also create, for each user, a distribution of what time during the day they're online, for example.  Both of these seem quite reductionist for the wealth of information present.

Anyway, I would be interested in this subreddit's thoughts on how best the information of time online could be summarized in an interesting way."

Unrelated phd - how to proceed?,2,3,False,False,False,datascience,1495500052,True,"I have a nearly entirely unrelated PhD (biomedical engineering) and have been working as an engineer in biotech now for about 2 years. I’m not really making as much money as I’d like to and it generally seems like the payscale and job prospects are not that great in the industry. Perhaps as important, much my job is pretty boring. One of the good things about the job though is I’ve had the opportunity to learn and use R and SQL pretty regularly to handle the relatively large volumes of data we generate and search for trends or drifting processes, and I’ve come to enjoy this aspect of the job much more than the rest of it. 

Because of this, I’ve become interested in data science and have taken some Coursera courses, taught myself some python, read some of the recommended textbooks like Intro to statistical learning, etc. As a trial, I’ve shot out a good 30 resumes or so to data science related jobs trying to highlight all the computational work that I have done, which is admittedly probably limited, but I’ve received no replies. I suppose this isn’t much of a surprise given my lack of background in the field. I wanted to figure out the right way to transition to the field as effectively as possible. Would it be worthwhile to do one of those online masters, like the Georgia tech MS in analytics, or is that overkill? What are the other best alternatives? Or is it just not worth it at this point, as I’d be giving up some significant domain expertise?

Entering Data Science from a statistics background,5,5,False,False,False,datascience,1495585558,True,"Note: I am going to cross-post this r/cscareerquestions as well. 


My question revolves around how to enter the ""field"" of data science given a background in statistics and econometrics. 

To provide context, I took a few math courses (up to the level of undergraduate real analysis), so I am no stranger to proofs. I took courses relating to mathematical probability as well as econometrics, so I think I am well-equipped on the statistics side. What I do not have is the actual programming know-how or portfolio to put it all together.

I have done some research, and I know there are several options in general for those without a strictly CS background, namely MOOCs, boot camps, and higher education. Disregarding the higher education option for now, the two options require a basic understanding of what data science is and the general tools of the trade. I am working on this via CalTech's CS156 lectures and subsequently Andrew Ng's CS229.

(and other pet peeves)",6,3,False,False,False,datascience,1495666810,True,"I'm not saying that I'm not grateful for all the predecessors in the past who paved the way but the buzzword usage of ""big data"" in mixed-background corporate boardrooms is so hackneyed and overused nowadays that it's a deprivation of any intent to properly define what they are actually talking about....they treat it like a black box and somehow the genie works....aka statistics and algorithms

All the salespeople and business negotiators who know how to use rudimentary Excel pivot tables and SQL think that their 'loose definition' of big data allows them to smear this buzzword in every crevice of their conversation, proposal titles, and presentations just to sound smart in front of the uninformed. Big data is a misnomer tacked on to everything for it to seem more je ne sais quoi than what it actually is.

I mean, it's cool because they are educating themselves on the new trends but after a while, it gets so old and unimaginative...if it's a data frame with 1 million rows just be humble and call it a data frame already...if it's anything less and you can open the file on excel without it lagging for 2 minutes, the data is not big enough to qualify -- that's the rule of thumb.

If you are practicing the discipline among peers, you don't dare utter that term unless you want to be the laughing stock...the term 'data science' in the future will also fall into this category...just call things predictive analytics or bayesian machine learning or the precise term for what you are doing already. if it's a tuple, call it a tuple already..having something be called a 'data dump' is much more refreshing than it being called 'big data' -- on the condition that data dump is the accurate definition of what is depicted.

You gotta use more precise terms instead of a bloated conglomerate term that could mean everything and anything that could qualitatively be described as ""big"" and any 'thing' that could be broken down as ""data""...in the same vein, any hard discipline could be classified as a ""science,"" which would also make the term ""data science"" obsolete as well because a lot of disciplines are sciences and they generate data....

All these candy conferences with 'big data' in their title are there to introduce the topic to the layman or to the businessmen with investment money trying to upscale and sigma six their business. It's a double edged sword because machine learning, algorithms, and automation will lay off half their staff. The people whose jobs are in jeopardy would rather turn away from the technology and do busy-work for the rest of their lives instead of retraining for industry

I have a pet peeve with corporations refusing/neglecting to implement some of this machine learning, algorithms, and automation correctly to their business model while adapting to the times...programming needs to be taught in school and treated as importantly as studying a foreign language. MBAs need coding classes to get their feet wet into the business world of tomorrow..data analytics is a start

...I also have a pet peeve with too many companies trying to save money by hiring no-name consulting companies-who-claim-what-they-know-what-they-are-doing but fall sub par with industrial standards to the point that the progress never develops and these money-conscious companies subsequently shy away from hiring true talent or established companies that could upgrade them properly because they are afraid to put value and invest in the future.

Some conservative companies actively try to suppress this technology due to their ""higher morals"" when the money that the company can save can pay off their severance packages...not to mention that you and I are both wasting our adult lives at work doing the mindless tasks that could be automated..it's hard to let go but do you want to be a pencil pusher for the rest of your career? time is money and we're wasting both. Time to retrain for industry and do something worthwhile that has greater impact and brings higher sense of self; something that you always wanted to do while sustaining your bottom line...because after all, life is too short"

Advice on transitioning my career into more advanced data/analytics?,1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1495762417,True,"My background/resume:

I'm 25 years old.  Graduated 2.5 years ago with a BBA in Management Information systems from a US school with a top 10 ranking in that degree.  So in college i took:

- Intro to Programming (java)

- Intro to Data Management (SQL)

- Web Application Development (capstone course - developed web apps using java/sql,html,css)

- Energy Informatics (R)

I also took Statistics and Calculus courses early in my career and aced those courses.  Finished with a 3.14 GPA and a 3.54 GPA within my MIS classes.

(note - even though i took these classes in college, it's been two years and my skills aren't that great anymore.  I have that background though and i'm confident in my ability to pick it back up again.

After graduating i took a job as a business analyst and i'm really dissatisfied with my job.  I do a lot of work in excel, I set up and basically run my company's whole salesforce reporting, I use SQL minimally, and I try to use R just because i want to improve my skills, but i rarely have any need to use it.  My pay is well below average for my degree, and I don't see my career going anywhere at the company I'm at.  

All along I've wanted to get into a career in more advanced analytics, and I want to develop my skills in R/enterprise tools for data visualization.  For whatever reason i wasn't able to get the jobs i wanted after college and i've had no luck interviewing since then.

At this point i don't know where to go.  I'm extremely passionate about data/statistics/analytics/etc. but i don't know how to develop those skills further or get into a profession that can help me develop those skills.  Meanwhile I'm pretty envious of all my friends from college getting great jobs consulting at big-4 firms and making significantly more money than me.

I'm wondering if anyone has been where I am and has some advice on how I can get where I want to.. I can't see the pathway.  

Are there particular jobs that I should be looking for (in the area of data/analytics/informatics/etc.) that would accept someone of my skills?  Should I look into grad school? Do i have the prerequisites for an MS or MBA in Data Analytics?  Is this even the correct subreddit to ask these questions?

I just feel like i need someone's help so that i can take the necessary steps.  

Thank you!

tl;dr - i have an MIS background and I'm trying to move towards a career in data analytics. What are the steps I can take? I'm lost."

Request for Resume Feedback. Aiming for Data Scientist / Machine Learning roles.,15,4,False,False,False,datascience,1495777008,True,"Hello everyone,

First time posting here 😊

Here's the link to my resume:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8LY1mcmNUcENUxkcDY2UVM0Rnc/view?usp=sharing

Would anyone be kind enough to review my resume and provide some feedback?

I’d really appreciate any feedback that you can provide, particularly if you’re working in the data science field or are used to looking at DS resumes.

I am hoping to land a data science role where I can develop my skills in Machine Learning, ideally in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Examples of the kind of DS opportunities that I want to target:
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/270937560/
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/345457055/
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/270954646/

I’m Canadian but have family in Texas, and looking for roles anywhere in US, but ideally California or Seattle area. 

I’m currently finishing up my Masters in Big Data in UK, graduating in July 2017. I’ve listed the highlights of my coursework and projects that I’ve worked on, just to give you an idea of the DS fundamentals that I know. 

I crafted my resume based on the skills and experience that I would have gained by the end of my masters, as my prior experience is in design engineering and consulting and nothing related to data science. However, I may not be presenting my skills/experience in the way that I should.

Two KEY questions that I'm trying to figure out:
1. Is this resume tailored towards a starting DS/ML position.
2. If you saw this resume, would you setup a follow-up call ?

Any other qualitative feedback is greatly appreciated!!

Thank you so much for your time and help in reviewing my profile.

---

A few notes regarding my resume based on the feedback that I've read on this subreddit:
*      I put education first since I'm currently studying and will be applying for jobs as a graduate student.
*      I am not able to weave the technical tools (Python, R etc) that I've listed into the achievements at each of my jobs, because I did not use any of them at my previous jobs. The only thing relevant I used was Excel.
*      I combined the job's responsibilities with my achievements instead of separating them, because I was trying to be brief and concise and was trying to focus more on achievements. 
*      I am hoping that the ""Projects"" section under my Master's is sufficiently framing my activities to data science, particularly because my prior professional experience is not DS related.

Edit:
Sorry, I should have made it clear, I changed any identifying information including the name of the companies, my contact info, email addresses for anonymity purposes. 

Obviously, if I was a founder of fitbit then I wouldn't be looking for a job right now. I thought that it would be obvious that fitbit was a placeholder name for my startup, and also because I used my reddit ID for my email and github account on my resume. But I guess I was wrong. My bad...

But I'm not lying on my resume. All the underlying information is correct and can be backed up, EXCEPT that the version you guys are seeing have placeholder company names and contact info. Also, my name is not David Hutchinson but I guess it's a bit better than having another 'John Doe' on a resume

How does data science fit into a firm with low-frequency data about their business?,8,17,False,False,False,datascience,1495803130,True,"I work as a data analyst for a commercial insurance brokerage. I'm trying to come up with a plan to nudge our organization in a more sophisticated direction when it comes to the analysis we do internally and for our clients. As the insurance industry is behind the technology curve in 95% of cases, I believe there's a big opportunity to make a splash with data offerings. There's definitely more that we can do with the tools we have (i.e. the big players in BI, more or less), and I have that on lock.

What I'm uncertain about is whether a data science platform would even work for our organization. If you don't know anything about brokerages, know this: most of us don't have many clients, and the information about the clients we have doesn't change very often. We're a fairly large brokerage and we still don't have 10,000 clients. What I'm trying to get at is that we're not GEICO with everyone and their dog having an auto policy and a homeowners policy and maybe a motorcycle policy and maybe little Jimmy is going off to college as well so he needs renters insurance and so on. Even for our largest clients, the information we have is scant and changes at a snail's pace.

I have the following available to me:

- Client demographics, but mostly limited to where you're located, what industry you're in, how long you've been in business.

- Coverage information. We have all the policies we broker for them on record, but we don't necessarily have all the important details about those policies in a place we can query.

- Transactions. As a broker, premium dollars flow in to us and out to our carrier partners. Our revenue is a commission on that premium, and our sales staff gets a cut of that commission.

Unfortunately, that's about it at this time. Here's what I know I need:

- More client demographics, especially financial performance and cultural observations (e.g. what's your risk tolerance? how do you approach safety in the workplace? etc.)

- More about the clients we don't have. What's the market like out there where our sales staff hasn't had any opportunities? How much do we already control of the markets our clients are in?

- More about the coverage in the policies we broker. I need every data point, full stop, but the data points that I need the most are those that carriers use to calculate their rates.

If you're still reading, thank you. Maybe I'm answering my own question here, but do we need to get all these data gaps filled before thinking about uttering the phrases ""machine learning"" or ""Bayesian inference"" or anything like that? If not, what can we do with our current, low-frequency data? What am I missing?"

(using a movie dataset with several tables) - We'd like you to tell us which genres are most clear-cut and which are so muddled that they tend to be listed among several others for a typical movie.

In other words, let us know- for each genre in the dataset- how many genres the movies in that genre are in, on average. For example, if an average Horror movie is in 1.3 genres and average Adventure movie is in 2.9 genres then we would say Horror is a better-defined genre than Adventure.

To polish up your answer, please provide both the average and maximum number of genres for movies in each genre but sort the list in descending order by average genre count.

Please give me some guidance and see if Im making the right choices.,10,6,False,False,False,datascience,1495902964,True,"So in May 2018 I graduate college with a degree in Physics and Applied Math with concentration in stats. 

I really want to to go to grad school for stats or data science. But maybe work for a year or two before I start grad school. I'd like for the work I do after my undergrad to be data science-y. 

For this summer I have a 'data analytics' internship at a small marketing agency which means nothing honestly. They use a marketing automation platform for 1 or 2 of their clients but there's no CRM integration so there's barely any data. I helped them get data from their software API but other than that I spend my day doing inane tasks like making plots of Google analytics data and exporting data to excel and writing a report about what it means. It doesn't feel like I'm doing any real analytics. 

In the meantime I've completed a series of MOOCs on Python and did a few small projects and feel good about my basic understanding of Python. Right now I'm doing the 10 course Data science specialization in R by John's Hopkins. 

As soon as it's done, I'm gonna finish reading 'Hands on machine learning with sci kit learn and tensor flow' and then I want to take some MOOCs on databases and THEN start building a portfolio. 

Does this seem like an okay path? My stats background is decent. Because of how courses are structured at my college, I can't take time series but I will be taking stochastic models and mathematical stats and a course in probability and stats for data science. 

What am I missing? What should I add/improve. Should I take the Stanford machine learning course? Read ISL/ESL?

Is this wrong application of PCA?,8,4,False,False,False,datascience,1496008732,True,"Hey reddit

I think im applying PCA wrong. 

I have a time series financial data that has time, price, and bunch of factors that affect that theorteically the price, such as inflation, interest rate, unemployment, etc.

I'm using PCA to find out which components have 0 eigenvalues (i.e. ignorable) with respect to price so I can ignore them in my future code (in case anyone is wondering, beta factor modeling).

Here's the code I am using

        
    	df = collect_df() # basically compiles many pickles into one giant DF, indexed by time... minus PRICE. Nothing fancy
        df.dropna(inplace=True)
    
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        df_std = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df)
    
        pca = PCA()
        pca.fit(df_std)
    
        variance_ratios = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
        factors_and_pca = dict(zip(df.columns, variance_ratios ))
        pprint(factors_and_pca)
    
    
        plt.bar(range(len(factors_and_pca)), factors_and_pca.values(), align='center')
        plt.xticks(range(len(factors_and_pca)), factors_and_pca.keys())
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show() 

Here are couple of problems and questions

1) I noticeed that the 1st column almost always has the highest variance ratio. If I remove this col (col 1) via (del(df[""col1""])), the next column (i.e. col2) becomes the highest variance ratio column. 

Here's the original graph: https://s2.postimg.org/uzfaj0xjt/plotted-1.png

After I remove the first column (quandl-FRED-BASE), i get https://s2.postimg.org/vdgmimhnd/plotted-2.png

In other words, every time I shift the array over one, the graph always says that the 1st column has the highest variance ratio (which naturally sounds wrong)

Am I misunderstood? Is this not how PCA is used? 

2) I am still confused - how can PCA figure out variance ratio w/respect to the price if the price column is NOT passed into PCA?  I've been following this guideline (http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html) that uses Iris data packaged with scikit learn.

For the record, I was indeed intending to go actuarial, but for reasons too long to explain, I've been drawn more and more to this field in recent months. 

So having said all that, would landing in a Data Analyst or Junior Data Scientist position and staying in it for 3 or so years (on top of learning new programming, techniques, etc.) be sufficient (or not) to transfer into the full-fledged Data Scientist position? Or do I absolutely need a Master's for this? I don't mind going this route if need be, the only problem though is the debt I'd incur, which is something I'd of course have to plan around...

Follow up question, if I don't need a Master's, are there any certifications of sorts I should (or perhaps have to) earn?

Ideally I'd like to be able to take some stored data, run certain statistical methods/algorithms/processing over it, and then serve it up to users in a nice looking web app.

I've done a little scripting in everything, and my SQL is quite good, but basically know very little about accomplishing the rest.

What would be a good method of doing this for a small volume of data/no. of users? Medium? Large? What about for more processing-intensive analytics?

For something basic I'm thinking you have a cronjob script (Python, etc) on your database running every 15 minutes or so which pulls out the data from the relevant database, does the necessary calculations, then maybe feeds the data back into another table on the database. End users accessing the dashboard on your web app then pull these analysed values (don't really know anything about how this is done).

What would a good system look like? How does it change when you start scaling? I feel like I've learned a bunch of things (NoSQL dbs, different scripting languages, etc) with no understanding of how to piece them all together.

1. SMU

* Curriculum: 
https://datascience.smu.edu/academics/curriculum/coursedescriptions/  Seems decent based on what I've been able to gather. I've been told machine learning is integrated into several of the courses already so I shouldn't be alarmed by the lack of a required machine learning class, although they will also be launching a dedicated machine learning course soon that I would likely take.

2. Northwestern 


* Curriculum: http://sps.northwestern.edu/program-areas/graduate/pdfs/2016_Grad_Program_Curricula_2016-17.pdf (scroll down to pag 16).  This is ""predictive analytics"" rather than Data Science, but the differences don't seem huge other than perhaps more of an emphasis on the statistics side of things vs computer science.

3. Regis

* Curriculum: http://www.regis.edu/CCIS/Academics/Degrees-Programs/Graduate-Programs/MS-Data-Sciences.aspx (scroll down to program requirements). 

That last program I'm not as familiar with, but it's substantially cheaper than the other 2. The total cost for Regis is ~25k vs ~50k for the other 2. The ""name brand"" of the school is weaker, but that's not necessarily a huge deal if the program is decent.

I'm aware these are all fairly pricey (especially the first 2), but it's a cost I'm willing to pay. Currently I don't make all that much in my BI role (around 60,000), and I'm hoping one of these will be able to help me transition to a higher paying job, hopefully at least in the $85,000 range, so it should pay for itself quickly (and improve my happiness quite a bit by getting me into a vastly more interesting job). Of course there are much cheaper ways to get a lot of this knowledge, but I think based on how I learn and my general personality type this type of program would work the best for me (plus, there is some value to just having a Master's degree to get your foot in the door/help your resume stand out).

Any thoughts or advice are appreciated, assuming it's at least reasonably educated (I'd rather not just get random baseless conjecture/speculation muddling up my thoughts). Thanks in advance!

A few weeks ago I submitted a post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/69zyfr/detecting_external_influencers_on_reddit/)) asking for some suggestions on how to improve a heuristic based vote manipulator detection python script. 

I haven't had much success, but I agreed to share my code and I'd love for anyone else to take a stab at it! The [github](https://github.com/benrules2/influencers) project is here, and a blog post with a longer write up can be found [here](http://www.cyber-omelette.com/2017/05/detecting-reddit-vote-manipulation.html).

Here's the rapid fire version. This script has two modes of operation. The first is to look at a single post, and look at the first 5 users who commented (configurable in the code to more than 5). I believe the earliest commenters will be the most likely to have been bought. Their account age, karma, number of interactions in the specific subreddit are gathered, along with a graph of interactions with other users in the thread.

The second mode of operation is the gather a ""fingerprint"" for the subreddit, but repeating the above steps but for a group of posts.  Right now I'm grabbing the top 50 sorted by week. This gives you an average value for all the above stats, and writes each individual post's stats to csv.

The idea being that if something suspicious is going on, the single post will have a major outlier from the collection of posts. So far I haven't been able to get anything concrete from it though.

I have also used the csv output for a group of posts to look for outliers and then check if there's anything suspicious about it. Again, no signal.  

I've also just started a new job, so my business hours redditing will be pretty infrequent and I may be slow to respond to discussion. Don't fret, I'll respond eventually! "

I understand how the CNN is going to work on my data, but I need advice on how to set it up in Keras.

In my dataset, each datapoint is structured as follows. There are *n* columns, each of which is sensor data of people performing an action. There are 10 rows where each row is a single person's sensor data for that event. The label column is a score for how well they performed. Since each of their performances is related, each datapoint is a 10 by *n* matrix, and the label column for each data point is a 10 by 1 vector of scores.

In my first layer (at the least), I want to set up convolutional neurons (I'm starting with 5, and moving on from there) so that each row shares weights amongst the observations, in such a way that the order I put the row in the datapoint doesn't matter (aside from it's correspondence with the label).

MS in Data Science worth?,10,2,False,False,False,datascience,1496542749,True,"**TL;DR** Got into an MS in Data Science program, is it worth it if its my only option and my undergraduate study was a BA in Neuroscience and a minor in computer science?

I recently got into a MS in Data Science program. I am unsure if I should even enroll in the MS in Data Science program. I have read a lot of reasons about why I should not enroll in this type of program. Some of the reasons are:

*  Programs are young.
* They can be easy because they are young and not worth the investment.
* You can gain all the skills via MOOCs and self learning for a fraction of the cost.

While I understand all of these reasons, a lot of Data Scientist jobs I have seen online ask for a minimum of a masters in a quantitative discipline. I feel like an MS in Data Science would allow me to get through this hurdle.

My background is a BA in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science and I think I have a decent technical background and consider myself a decent programmer and have learned statistics, discrete math, calculus, and linear algebra while in school, but my degree is not quantitative. So would this masters be worth it? Thanks for your help!

Simple cross-validation question,1,3,False,False,False,datascience,1496624016,True,"I'm having trouble understanding some concepts of k-fold cross validation and how to use it in sklearn.

My understanding is as follows:

Divide your data set up into k stratified sections. Now perform an iterative procedure where you perform a traditional train/test split and one alternating section is used as the testing set. At the end of this iterative procedure (k iterations), each of the k # of sections has been used to represent testing data.  Next, you average all of the accuracies of the splits and this is a representation for the overall accuracy. The model you use is the split that gave you the highest accuracy.

 


I have three questions:


1 - Supposedly, the benefit of this is that your model will have been both trained and tested against each data point in your training set which doesn't really make sense. Haven't you simply picked the model that gave the highest accuracy (which is just a specific train/test split)? 



2 - How is the overall accuracy the average of all split accuracies if we are sticking to one model which is shown to (probably) perform better than the others? Wouldn't the best estimate for overall accuracy be the specific accuracy for the best model since that is the model we are using? We aren't even using the other models.

3 - It seems that in sklearn you can only use cross-validation to give accuracies of each of the splits. How would you go about training a classifier using the best model from a cross-validation and applying it to future data?"

"Help with ranking by scores that contain multiple variables, with max score = 100",2,7,False,False,False,datascience,1496648524,True,"Hi DataScience,
 
Apologies if this is the wrong place for this- would be happy to post elsewhere if needed.
 
I needed help creating an equation for ranking items based on average evaluation scores, with the caveat that each item will contain multiple, varying data points (not all items will have the same amount of scores), AND, if any item receives a “star” (score of 100), I do not want to even consider the other scores contained within that item.
 
For example:

* Item A receives scores of:

100 (star)

12.5

25

* Item B receives scores of:

12.5

25

50

50

* Item C receives scores of:

12.5

12.5

* Item D receives a score of:

12.5

* Item E received a score of:

100 (star)
 
Looking at the above, since item A contains one score of 100, the subsequent scores are moot, and I would want to rank item A as highest as possible (along with item E).  Since item B’s scores add up to more than 100, but do not contain an individual score of 100, I would rank the items as follows:
 
**A and E as both 100 AND Item B lower than items A and E**

Now my question is, what would be the best way to rank items B, C, and D, in relation to A&E? While I am inclined to average each item’s scores up, how would I accurately rank items C and D, to show that item C received two scores of 12.5 and item D received one score of 12.5.


For the purposes of my analysis, I need to cap the score at 100.

Criticisms on my data analysis work?[X-post MLQuestions],3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1496687545,True,"Hey all,

I was wondering if there's a specific subreddit/discord channel or something where I can go to get feedback on my data analysis work. I've chosen to do some work on the New York crime data - basically predicting the type of crime. The link to my notebooks is [exploration notebook and prediction notebook](https://github.com/IanQS/Machine-Learning-mini-projects/tree/master/data_exploration)

I do have some self-criticisms but I'm not sure how to address them so I'm hoping the collective wisdom here can help? 

**Explore:**

1) Map data. I've plotted it but ""so what""? I don't know how to draw any conclusions from it. Anyone have any resources? 

2) I've dropped some variables, for example datetime (dd/mm/YY) and kept day month year, since I reason that the model should be able to ""reconstruct"" the datetime if all of it turns out to be important. I'm not sure if this is a valid assumption, or if what I'm doing is wise. 

**Predict:**

1) I'm defining ""correct"" if the class is the same, but I feel like my error function is wrong. I feel like I should be using cross entropy during the training process but I have no idea how to do that...

2) I feel like using real numbers to represent my classes is wrong and that I should be using One-Hot Vectors since there's no real ""distance"" between a class 1 and a class 2. I'm not sure if this opinion of mine is correct.

Also, I figure I should probably share the dataset. I'm not sure what the common method is so if people could suggest that it would be much appreciated

"How would you develop an ""Analytics Lab""?",1,7,False,False,False,datascience,1496711615,True,"Hello, I am looking into making a sandbox environment for testing out software tools or prototyping data analytic solutions at my company.  Not sure if it is possible to make one that is flexible for most business use cases and can be used by users of various backgrounds.  But first some background:  I am part of a business resource group (BRG) at my company tasked with improving and sharing data analytics knowledge throughout our company.  I am not part of our IT organization, but on the business side. I am a data analyst with several years (19+) of experience at an automobile manufacturing company in the U.S. - sorry not Tesla :-).  

I have a degree in Industrial Engineering with Python, Pandas, Jupyter notebook, scikit-learn, etc, knowledge stack under my belt.  Our business resource group consists of members from diverse backgrounds, which includes some IT members.  So that should help, I hope.  It is supported or backed by one of our executives for overall support.  Very few of our members have programming backgrounds and probably don't know their way around a terminal.  I would say most have the skill sets of a typical entry level to mid-range data analyst (proficient in SQL, Excel, and one or more BI tools like Tableau or QlikView).  I, along with some others, fall in the ""power users"" crowd.  We have a few Python people and even fewer R people.
  
Ideally, I would like this analytics lab to be an environment that is conducive to reproducibility and ease of use.  It would also be language or technology agnostic as possible, but mostly geared towards open source technology.  
  
My first thought would be to focus on infrastructure and/or use of virtualization software.  My ideal environment would be for users to be able to setup or duplicate the environment or analytics project from another user without having to perform complex installation procedures.  I have used VirtualBox in the past and I think our IT uses VMWare.  So I was thinking maybe leveraging these type of virtualization software for this analytics lab.  I should also mention that our users are not all located in the same building or even in the same part of the country.  So that needs to be taken into consideration.  I haven't had any in-depth discussions with our IT members of our BRG group yet.  I would like to first get some feedback and ideas here.  I know I have some major hurdles, I think especially with our IT, and our budget is very limited.  My company is a fairly big company so our IT is geared towards ""enterprise"" solutions.  We've had solutions provided in the past by IBM, SAS, Microsoft, etc.  But due to major budget cuts, I think our IT is forced to look at open source technologies.  It also helps that they are hearing a lot about Python and R since there is overwhelming interest in AI and machine learning.  We do make heavy use of robotics and machinery that is being converted to adopt IoT-related technologies here at my company.  Our users and IT use various data persistence technologies - anything from sqlite, MS Access, DB2, SQL Server, Hadoop, and MongoDB.  We supposedly have a ""data lake"" somewhere too.  Of course, we also have the usual BI tools whose use are scattered throughout our company like Tableau, Business Objects, and QlikView.
  
Then I think the next general direction would be to let the business use cases or problems drive or dictate what tools or solutions to research or use.  We definitely don't want to jump right into tools or technology first, but to first understand the business problems that need to be solved, learn from and meet with subject matter experts, and then worry about tools.  
  
Anyways, I think this is about it.  Sorry for the long post.  Thanks for reading!
  
TL;DR - Need to develop a sandbox analytics lab for testing/prototyping for users with various backgrounds and located throughout the U.S.  Since my company's IT is very ""enterprisey"", Need your feedback, ideas, suggestions, maybe tell me this is impossible, etc."

What is the most efficient way to prepare messy excel data for analysis in R or Python?,28,36,False,False,False,datascience,1496759558,True,"I've been given Excel files of research data records, and I need to do a statistical analysis. I am so used to collecting my own data and taking care to keep records in single header for column names + data format for easy porting to R or Python, that I am a little stumped on the best way to transform data that was not carefully put into columnar formats. 

  

I don't want to post the data here, but I will briefly offer the gist of how the data is set up now. The first column is subject numbers; the top row is dates; the second row is two other categories each paired to a date. Rows 3-100+ are the actual data that match to the participants for each date and category.  

  

Essentially there are two header rows, and I need to melt something somewhere so that I only have one header row.  

  

What is the best way to rearrange the data into a data table? Am I looking at making this into a Matrix (column header, row header) and then doing my analysis?

  

**Very abbreviated Example Table**  
(My data has 35 different dates)  

  

SubjectNo| Date| -    | Date| -    
- | - | - | - | - 
- | **Count**| **Style** | **Count**| **Style**

Need Career Masters Degree Advice with an Analytics Route,0,8,False,False,False,datascience,1496864256,True,"I am currently in the insurance industry. I interned as a college student at this company and have been full time as an entry level Data Analyst for about a year but have been at the company a total of 2 years.

I have a B.S. in Applied Math w/ minor in stats and graduated with a 3.85 GPA.

I'm looking to start pursuing my masters degree as I am 23 years old and ready to staple down a strong foundation for my future sooner than later.

My current options: 

• Return to my alma mater for a MS in stats. This University has a stats program that has seen better days but also may have a bright future if things go well. I am familiar with the environment and some of the professors since I took some upper level stats electives while I went for my math degree. I want to do this part time with my job so I don't have to quit since I don't want to take the pay cut. I'm making near 50k in the midwest area currently.

• Go to nearby university and pursue a MS in Business Analytics

• Quit my job and pursue a more advanced degree related to biology/chemistry and math/stats (bioscience, bioinformatics, etc.) full time at a nearby university and take a big pay cut as a TA


Now onto what I want to do with my career:

I have some computer science experience and am fairly well versed in basic programs such as Excel, JMP and SQL. I have only began to start using R as my company is behind on times in the data department (they are currently undergoing a data overhaul to make things better).

I have experience working on predictive analytics models and have had a fair amount of exposure to SQL to the point where I feel that I can generate useful queries rather easily.

My career interests are definitely not in insurance. Biostatistics interests me for sure and possibly machine learning (I don't have enough exposure to say if I believe I would enjoy this or not) in various industries but moving in the future to the west or more tech areas is something that possibly interests me.

I currently have no undergrad school debt and am beginning to start saving up more for my future.

Any ideas or possible routes that I could take in addition to these would be great. Recommendations on my situation would be very much appreciated.

Was hoping to get some feedback on something I've been working on recently, and see if anyone was interested in collaborating on a project.

In the spirit of all the political happenings these days, I thought it would be cool to try and build an ML classifier to predict whether a twitter user is a political bot account based on their profile information. Ideally, I'll like to turn it into a Google Chrome extension in which users would be notified if some of their followers (or a specific profile they're visiting) are suspected political twitter bots.

I have a bare-bones proof-of-concept classifier available here: https://valkommen.pythonanywhere.com/ where a twitter url can be entered (e.g., https://twitter.com/wilson2823), and the classifier outputs a probability of ""bot"" or ""not bot"".

Where the collaboration comes in, is I need help from someone who is experienced in JavaScript and/or building Chrome extensions to make this happen.

So, does this seem like a worthwhile thing to try? Is anyone out there actually experienced in building extensions and would like to help? Thanks for your feedback!"

Combining heuristics when ranking social network news feed items,0,7,False,False,False,datascience,1496927616,True,"We have a news feed, and we want to surface items to the user based on a number of criteria. Certain items will be surfaced because of factor A, another because of factor B, and yet another because of factor C. We can create individual heuristics for each factor, but we then need to combine these heuristics in such a way that it promotes the best content considering each factor while still giving a mix of content from each factor.

Our naive approach is to load the top n from each factor, take the first of each, and make those the first 3 of the feed. Then take the 2nd from each feed and make that the second 3, and so on and so forth. Ideally, we would have some algorithm for more intelligently ranking these feed items - our first thought was to simply sum the three heuristics and pull the top items using the resulting combined score, but there are no guarantees that the heuristics are evenly-scaled (or are evenly-scaled for that particular user), which could result in one factor dominating over the others in the feed. Is there some more intelligent way of ranking these news feed items (akin to what Facebook does in its pseudo-chronological news feed)?"

I ran t-SNE (BH Optimized Sklearn version) on a ~150,000 X 4000 dense matrix of data. The original dataset was a sparse matrix with shape ~150,000 X 700,000. I reduced the dimensionality of the original using Sklearn's TruncatedSVD, retaining ~80% of the variance.

My problem is: after running for 37 hours on a 64GB, 16-core VM in Azure Cloud, my code resulted in a Memory Error. I have no idea why this happened. I have gotten memory errors before while running t-SNE, but they almost always happen relatively quickly after starting the process. And, that was mostly the result of a previous implementation of t-SNE that scaled O(n^2); whereas, the current complexity of Sklearn's t-SNE implementation is O(n log n), so confused why the script failed with a memory error.

1. My master's thesis project was basically processing and imaging raw earthquake data (I don't remember how big the data set, at least 5-10 TB) and analyzing it in a geological setting 
1. A couple summer internships/research positions in which I was exposed to real work and real data

Ever since I started reading about the data industry, it seems that there are a lot of paths one can take. Throughout my job searches I've come across various positions that are very polarizing; those whose requirements I generally meet, and those that my skill set is nowhere near. 

Ideally, I'd like to develop a skill set that is useful to a company and myself in the longterm. However more often than not, I feel bugged down by all the terms, database languages, and algorithms that I come across. I would really appreciate some general advice, and some questions that I hope could be answered in detail are:

1.  What makes up a strong foundation for a data analyst (coding languages, querying languages, machine learning algorithms, etc.). What is a good blueprint or way to go about building this foundation?

1.  How do different industries (e.g. medical vs. automative) differ in what a data scientist or analyst is required to do?

1.  Should one aim for mastery in a specific skill, or be well rounded in many aspects of data science/analysis?

1.  What is the best way to advance my future career? I'm not talking about changing  positions every other year, but how do I stay relevant and avoid stagnation?

Lastly, I realize that there are many great resources online to learn different skill sets. I came across https://www.coursera.org/ that offers courses in various topics. What is the general opinion of their data courses?

Likelihood of finding a job with a 12-week bootcamp and no advanced degree?,8,10,False,False,False,datascience,1497282440,True,"Hey all,

I've done some searching around on here and haven't found anyone who was in my exact situation. I'm starting a 12-week data science bootcamp in a few weeks, where I will learn Python, R, and Hadoop and come out with several projects as a portfolio. I'm lucky enough to have the financial support of my parents right now, so I have a few months of headway after the conclusion of the bootcamp before I need to really start worrying. 

Some background:
I have a bachelors in chemical engineering (with a ~3.2 gpa from an average state school, if that matters at this point), and have a 3 month chemistry R&D internship and a year of chemical process support (hands-on work with hardware both in the office and at customer sites, as well as data analysis and some meddling with Python to try and automate a process). The customers in question are semiconductor manufacturers, so I'm hoping some recruiter finds the fact that I've worked in overseas semiconductor manufacturing cleanrooms interesting enough to call me in (yeah, right). Anyway, my technical skills for this job would be data analysis with Excel and macro creation with Excel and VBA. Like I mentioned earlier, I dabbled in some Python while at this job - I spent some time actually learning the language to try and parse text documents and create charts that specify chemical delivery volumes based on specific events in the log. I really enjoyed trying to create something that worked well, but I really didn't have enough time because of how hectic the rest of the job was. 

So yeah, any advice? I'm on the east coast in case that matters as well

I began the EE degree because I am interested in applications in synthetic Biology, and circuit design and control theory are useful in this field. However, I think my specific interest (visualization and prediction models for plant genetic alterations) might be classified more as data science. 

Might it be better to simply work and continue learning statisics & programming on my own? There are certainly plenty of resources. How important is a relevant degree? Is EE relevant?

I dont have:

1. Used car dealerships also sell wholesale.  i do not have how many vehicles they do.  So, this would mean that im underestimating their inventory.

2. Used car dealers get their inventory from trade ins, wholesale resllers , and auction.  different customers will use different channels in different proportions.  I do not know any of these data points.  

So, if im a whole sale reseller, i dont know how many vehicles a car dealer buys from whole sale resllers, so i cant calculate my share.

I can only calculate the proportion of vehicles sold to consumer, that the car dealer buys from us. correct?

I want to find reasons for the change in ROI between two periods.

I find important combinations of dimensions using a custom made decision tree. It allocates a score based on the change in investment share and change in ROI for a combination.

Would love thoughts on this approach.

I am worried that if I take the PhD, I will be getting a huge pay cut (about half of my current income) and I am not sure whether this will pay out in the end. What value do you think the PhD will add to my career path?

So recently my boss's boss asked me if I would host two of her kids for a day and let them see what an average day in the life is like for an Business Analyst like myself. They're both going into their junior year of high school in August, so they're getting close to the time when they will need to choose which schools to apply to, as well as choose which major to declare on their application. She wants to expose them to a few different kinds of jobs before they start that whole process.


My problem here is that I can't really figure out how to make my job duties seem remotely interesting to an outsider. Nor is there really much of an opportunity to show them around or do a hands-on demonstration with physical tools or equipment, because the job is conducted 100% on a computer.


And nobody wants to sit there the *entire* day watching some asshole just sit there and write SQL queries, debug said SQL queries, pull the results into Excel or Tableau, and then create some powerpoint slides. I do absolutely intend on spending a good chunk of time going through stuff like that, because that's pretty much the core of my job. But it would really suck if that's all I did.


Given that, I've come up with a couple ideas for engaging activities I can do instead:

* Pick out an interesting open source dataset that at least somewhat pertains to their interests and use it for a simple, fun analysis (maybe something on colleges)

* Go through a couple web-based sandboxes such as [this neural network sandbox](http://playground.tensorflow.org/)

* Go out on campus and actually collect some basic data on something, then analyze it

* Create a Tableau dashboard that uses information collected at the zip code level and their personal preferences to rank zip codes by how much they'd want to live there

The curriculum seems very well though out, the instructors are good and there are a few related to the field of quantitative finance which is my main goal after completing the degree. I just wanted to hear opinions about the programme, advice and recommendations for a student looking to start a career in quantitative finance or if that fails, data science.

Any criticism, help and recommendation is appreciated.

1.  I graduated with a bachelor's in Political Science almost a decade ago, for some reason thinking that I would be okay just 'having a degree'

2.  After many years of bouncing around, I started taking some MOOCs which led me to eventually completing a Master's in Analytics Degree

3.  I got hired on over a year ago by a Fortune 100 company to do 'data science', but it turns out that most of the tools required to do such work (R, Python) are not approved for use due to the open source component -- SAS is approved, but my department still hasn't received its licenses.

4.  I work with billions of rows of data on a daily basis using Teradata/SQL and find trends, inconsistencies, make recommendations, etc., but I'm really missing the predictive side that I studied so hard to learn.  

Given the above, what is the best way to transition into a role where I can do more predictive work?  I don't even need a 'data scientist' title, but I just want to work on modeling and use machine learning, etc.  

Should I put a github together and put some project work in there?  I just feel a bit hopeless, as in without any on-the-job predictive analytics work, I will never be able to transfer into one of these roles in the future.  "
"Data sets for supervised learning with Race, Sex, and other sensitive topics?",5,1,False,False,False,datascience,1497973654,True,"Hey there,

I'm a data scientist looking to create racism-proof ML algorithms by comparing the rates of false positives to false negatives between demographic groups, and integrating that into the objective function.

Does anyone know any good data sets to try this out on that include this sensitive information?

Thanks! 
CeleryMan35



Edit:  People seem to be misunderstanding what I am saying.  


What I want to ensure the confusion matrix looks the same for each demographic.  This will algorithm include race and gender.  It will use these sensitive parameters to inform which non-sensitive factors can be acceptably used.  


Eg, Location vs Recidivism.  If using location produces a reduction in RMSE, but also causes the algorithm to improperly exonerate more white people, and not improperly exonerate the same number of black people, any algo will use it.  I want to create an algorithm with a Loss function that will optimize RMSE along with balance in the confusion matrix:  Ratios of false positives to false negatives.  


If this ratio is balanced between demographic groups, an algo cannot be accused of being biased against any demographic group, as it will be misclassifying each at an identical rate.


This would permit nonparametric modeling in areas that have previously been disallowed: Eg, consumer insurance.  "

Career Help,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1498009657,True,"Hello Reddit Community,
I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Biology, and I feel as if that is the biggest mistake I have made for myself. When I started college I was eager to succeed and become a dentist. I never thought about doing anything else besides that, but as my grades plummeted I realized that the path I envisioned just wasn't going to happen. I struggled through my tough science classes and it felt like a drag and it even took me an extra year to complete my bachelors but I finally got the degree that holds zero value for me. Every time I sit and try to come up with a plan on what to do next I feel as if a heavy rock has been placed on me. But the clock is ticking and it doesn't stop for anyone, so I do need to figure out what my next step is on this road to success. So far I have thought about doing nursing, I never wanted to do that but with my background in science and poor GPA it seems to be a valid option. My second thought was completely changing my field of education and trying for the IT field. But for that I have no idea where to beginning from. I know Data Science is a huge growing field right now and they earn well also. But how do I figure out that that is the career path for me? I am afraid to make the wrong choice and regret it later or waste my time. I know, I know, that is life and I cannot be afraid of it if I want to go somewhere. I need to stop thinking the ""buts"" the ""what ifs"" and go for something already, as of right now I'm wasting time regardless. Honestly, I just want to make a lot of money with a slightly easier path than becoming a doctor of some sort. Just look at the Kardasians, living in millions for doing what? I always thought about becoming a Youtuber, I am a creative person, I want to be famous, who doesn't? Or be one of those Instagram models? Why not? It all seems nice to think about but not practical for the future, or I just don't have the courage in me.
What my nursing friends tell me- they started making 93K and only have to work 13 shifts a month- that's like working 150 days out of 356 days. Sounds nice but why hasn't this pushed me to do that then. Going for the corporate world means working a 9-5pm job M-F. I ask myself do I want to wear scrubs for the rest of my life or business wear, nice pencils skirts? And I honestly don't know the answer to any of these questions. Can I get a trial and error at this life. There are an endless amount possibilities I can choose from yet I can't pick any.
The nurses out there, please tell me the pros and cons about what you do. And if this was the route I chose what would my next step be? Should I go for an associates first since my GPA is so low and then do a bridge programs? Is getting a second bachelors degree worth what you guys do?
Anyone in the IT field, (data scientists, QAs, anyone) how do I enter this field with a biology background? Should I find some internship? I looked into those data science boot camps but they seem pricey for something I'm unsure of. Any insight on what your job entails of would help.
Redditters please help me clear up the clutter in my mind, let me know what you would do in my place.
Thank you"

Getting into Data Science without a degree,19,17,False,False,False,datascience,1498047954,True,"Hi folks; I was wondering if anyone had any advice.

I completed a year of my undergraduate degree (Electronic Engineering) before pulling out for various reasons. Fast forward nine years, and I've been working for a number of reputable companies in the field of Data Analytics for the better part of five of them.

To date, my lack of degree hasn't completely hindered my job prospects, but I am aware that there's a potential glass ceiling in terms of pay, and certain companies are likely to throw my resume out without looking at it due to my lack of schooling.

I can see two options from here (if there are more please let me know!):

1. Going back to college.
Is starting from scratch and undertaking a bachelors degree, before going on to a masters the only option if I wanted to make the jump from being a Data Analyst to a Data Scientist? Or are there schools out there who will overlook the previous lack of schooling and take experience / professional certification into account in lieu of a degree?

2. Trying to get a Data Science role without formal schooling:
Does anyone here have experience with companies hiring Data Scientists without formal schooling under their belt? If so, what evidence could be used in lieu of a degree / qualification?

Your thoughts on my conundrum are much appreciated - thanks in advance!"

Question about Model Selection,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1498073345,True,"I'm reading a book called Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow. From the book: 

> One way to [fine-tune your parameters] would be to fiddle with the hyperparameters manually, until you find a great combination of hyperparameter values. This would be very tedious work, and you may not have time to explore many combinations.

> Instead you should get Scikit-Learn’s GridSearchCV to search for you. All you need to do is tell it which hyperparameters you want it to experiment with, and what values to try out, and it will evaluate all the possible combinations of hyperparameter values, using cross-validation. For example, the following code searches for the best combination of hyperparameter values for the RandomForestRegressor:

    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    param_grid = [
        {'n_estimators': [3, 10, 30], 'max_features': [2, 4, 6, 8]},
        {'bootstrap': [False], 'n_estimators': [3, 10], 'max_features': [2, 3, 4]},
      ]
    forest_reg = RandomForestRegressor()
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(forest_reg, param_grid, cv=5,
                               scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')

    grid_search.fit(housing_prepared, housing_labels)

However, from the [scikit-learn docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html): 

> When using ensemble methods base upon bagging, i.e. generating new training sets using sampling with replacement, part of the training set remains unused. For each classifier in the ensemble, a different part of the training set is left out.

> This left out portion can be used to estimate the generalization error without having to rely on a separate validation set. This estimate comes “for free” as no additional data is needed and can be used for model selection.

And then it lists various estimators that have 'out of the bag' estimates implemented, and RandomForestRegressor is one of them. Does this mean that the book's example is ""wrong"" in the sense that this technique isn't actually needed for random forest regressors in scikit-learn?"

What I want to propose is that I can do things for people.  I can graph for them.  One person asked me to shorten file names for her so she doesn't have to rename them individually.  I can run models that people buy specialist programs for.  But the problem is that I'm up against a group of really independent researchers.

How do I sell myself to these people who like to do it themselves?"

I am planning to get my Masters in Data Science which is a pretty big sidestep from English which was my undergrad degree. As a result I have not taken any Math since high-school. To get started I retook PreCalc since I had not taken it since highschool and am now taking statistics. I'm good at math so I am not worried about the course work. That is all that is required for me to enroll in a data science program at the UMUC (University of Maryland online system). As I do not have any experience in computer science the advisor let me know I would need to enroll in a noncredit course before I started my maters course work.

How many news articles should I scrape for a data analysis of the news?,6,6,False,False,False,datascience,1498247264,True,"About a month ago I was inspired to begin scraping articles from news sites to to see if analysis could reveal a few things about the way the news is written today, including 1) whether digital-native publications have markedly different features than print-to-digital ones, and 2) if orgs of different political leanings write differently. Other potential hypotheses abound, which is why I want to make sure I have enough data.

I'm at about 60,000 articles in my SQLite database now, scraped with a patchwork of BeautifulSoup and regex (I scrape RSS links from the Wayback Machine, then churn those scraped links through another scraper). The news articles go from mid-2017 back to 2014 (mostly), and so far I have articles from the NY Times, LA Times, Vox, CNN, Breitbart, and the Verge (any recommendations for other publications is welcome). I know the answer to ""how much data"" is always ""it depends"", but my original goal of 100,000 articles seems kind of small if I want to be representative across different kinds of news orgs.

So, how much data? And what considerations should I be making as I scrape it? I haven't yet decided on specific algorithms/tools for the actual analysis, but figured Naive Bayes could make an appearance, and probably regression. I'd like to see what a neural net finds, but I'm still not very seasoned with using them.

I am trying to be skeptical of new master programs like this before making choices.

Their reply:

""Regarding Python, it is used in a limited way in some of the Computer Science modules, however the modules 1. Fundamental Maths and Stats for Health Data and 2. Biomedical Modelling for Health Data both use the R programming language in delivery and teaching. R has been used primarily in academia and research and focuses on better, user friendly data analysis, statistics and graphical models. Python has more traditionally been used by programmers who want delve into data analysis or apply statistical techniques, and by developers that turn to data science. For exploratory work, R is easier for beginners and that is certainly true for many of the students who join our course as statistical models can be written with a few lines of code. ""

How to speed up this very basic and naive python script ?,17,1,False,False,False,datascience,1498561195,True,"I've two files with almost 20000 rows in each. In one file there is a IPv4 network address column (cmplete along with subnet mask). In another file, there is an IPv4 address column. However, some of those addresses are 'host' addresses while others are 'network 'addresses.

My task is to add two cells against each row in the first file ... one cell indicating the quantity of the IPv4 addresses of the second file which fall within the network specified by the current cell in the first file, and another cell indicating the 'serial-numbers/primary-keys ' (another column in second file) of the those matching IPv4 addresses.

I've used openpyxl and wrote the following code ...

    from openpyxl import load_workbook

                continue
        if matching_serialnumbers:

Adding business requirements to statistical segmentation. is this the right way to do it?,1,8,False,False,False,datascience,1498566460,True,"So, I am trying to segment my customers by the ""most important to focus on"". whcih was a broad request. i know two things from the business end:

1. They will want a top X customers to be labeled major accounts.  This should likely be done by revenue.

2. They arent going to want a straight revenue ranking for the other 98% of the customers

So, i decided to create a wallet share estimate for each customer and use that as the target variable in a regression tree.

I would  force the first break done on total revenue to get the major accounts.

then let the tree segment the rest.

is this a right approach to encorporating business requirements to a segmentation request? my thought process ok?

Im transitioning from finance to more of a data science role through virture of online classes and self teaching.

Can anyone offer some advice?,11,14,False,False,False,datascience,1498582441,True,"Hi Guys, I was wondering if I could get some advice about something.

After a few initial phone screens, I was recently told that a company I had applied to would like to have me out for an onsite visit. I was told the salary for the position would be ~$90,000, which seems a bit low for the location, but this would be an entry level position (so maybe this is reasonable?). I was also told that there would be up to 80% travel time, in which we would meet with clients to discuss their needs (i.e., discuss with them what types of data they have available, what they'd like to get out of it, possibly present results, etc.).

The onsite consists of a 20 minute presentation, followed by three 45 minute one-on-one interviews.

My problem is that I'm naturally a pretty introverted person and have a lot of anxiety about this kind of stuff -- the idea of 80% traveling, constantly meeting with different clients in a business setting, presenting results directly to them etc., etc., does not make me feel very good. I just need some opinions on if anyone else has been in a similar situation, whether 80% seems pretty excessive (I know some people love it), etc. This stuff is starting to make me question whether I want this job or not, and I can't decide if it's my anxiety taking over, or if this just really isn't the gig for me.

Do data science jobs exist where the majority of time is spent cleaning and analyzing data rather than meeting with clients and traveling? Thanks!"

You might be seeing this question quite often and I know that because I've read all of them. The problem is I am more confused than ever.
I'm an Indian guy who comes from a poor family. I always loved computers but my financial condition never allowed me to pursue it, as engineering is quite expensive in India.
So after passing intermediate, I opted for commerce. I had zero interest in it tho. 
After doing Bachelor in Commerce, I got a job as a data analyst in a marketing firm where I came to know about data science and it lights up my hopes of being able to do what I always wanted to do.
Fortunately, with the sheer amount of data that we have to work on gave us the opportunity to learn Python and incorporate it in our daily work. I can't be happier so, I started learning Python and I am in love with it.
I finally have a purpose in life and I am very motivated to work for it at any cost possible.
Now, I need help and after browsing and searching the Internet, I am more confused then ever.
Please help me to build a roadmap for my Journey to be a data scientist.

1)How to study? which topic to start first(maths/programming)
2)What to study? courses/books/anything

That said, what I think I want in a job someday is something under the ""work to live"" category. I certainly don't mind working hard while at work, occasionally putting in long hours, etc., but on the average I want to have a job where I put in the 40 hours and can be done. I don't want it to be expected that I always have side projects going on in addition to work.

How to visualize logistic regression with only categorical predictor variables/features?,3,4,False,False,False,datascience,1498598495,True,"Let's say we were running a logistic regression model whereby the model only had categorical features, e.g.

I used C++ for my thesis project. I've also used R and Python for data analysis and machine learning personal projects. I've gotten interviews for Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, C++ Developer, etc jobs. I've had a fair amount of initial phone screens with HR that rarely lead to a technical interview (I haven't had this problem for the C++ developer roles). I've had some technical phone screens for Data Engineer and Data Scientist roles, but I apparently did poorly on those too and rarely get invited on-site. I'd say I get callbacks at a lesser rate for Data Analyst roles, but at least some on-site interviews for them, whereas I've gotten nearly 0 on-site interviews for Data Scientist/Engineer roles

I've gotten so many different kinds of technical questions or questions about my resume. I've already kept track of the ones I got wrong but I felt I should've gotten correct if I studied more. I spent the necessary time researching those problems to make sure I get them correct next time. But what's frustrating is that I'll rarely get asked a similar question like that again. If I do, it'll be at least a few months afterwards, when I've already forgotten it.

I've applied all over the US, but am now focusing on companies close to where I live and the Bay Area, as I pretty much only get on-site interviews for them. I already have a Github, my own website, etc. 

For those with a Master's in Physics, was your search for a DS this difficult and time-consuming? What should I be spending most of my time studying to prepare for interviews: SQL, data structures/algorithms, stats, Hadoop/Hive/Pig, machine learning, etc? Or should I learn deep learning, neural networks, tensorflow?

Exploratory analysis on electricity-related dataset?,0,3,False,False,False,datascience,1498669477,True,"hey all, I'm trying to get better at some open-ended analytics and came across a pretty massive dataset that has a lot of stuff I can play around with. Thing is, I'm actually having some trouble approaching what I thought should be a reasonably simple problem given my Econ background. I want to give price modeling in R (given some clearing demand and a rough aggregate supply) a shot, and I think I have everything I need, but it seems like I just have a mental block about it.

My dataset has power quantities (in megawatts) and price bids pertaining to each individual electricity generator (commercial) for a state in the US, as well as telemetric data on how much electricity was actually generated, over 15-minute intervals throughout the day. At first glance, the setup seems fairly simple: the sum of telemetric generation data in each quarter hour is my clearing demand curve, and the sum of all the quantities (at the given bid price) associated with each generator during that quarter hour is the supply curve. 

I have two roadblocks, though. First, there's not just a single curve for the price/quantity related to the bids; ***there's 13***, and I'm not sure how to go about aggregating them. Second, how do I handle the cyclical nature of this data in R? To clarify, in the CSV I have, the first 517 rows have all the observations for each generator at 12 AM, the next 517 have the same observations but at 12:15 AM, the next 517 have the same observations but at 12:30 AM, and so on. If I load this into data.tables, is there a way to aggregate by timestamp (which is a feature/column in the dataset) so that I can model discretely instead of stepwise per 15 minutes? 

I can pass out the dataset if anyone wants to take a closer look, and clarify my thought process as much as possible if people want more on that. Thanks very much in advance for any suggestions, and cheers!"

I'm new to Reddit, but I worked on a personal data science project where I downloaded a lot of recent Trump tweets and analyzed which words were used together in the same tweets. For example, if the words ""they"" and ""gone"" and ""Hello"" were in the same tweet, they were marked down. I did this for groupings of 2, 3, and 4 words (I tried 5 and my computer crashed).

Also, this is still a work in progress, there may be some bugs (I've noticed that empty strings end up being checked sometimes).

Here are the results I found were relevant (sorry for the poor  formatting, I'm still new to reddit, and I don't want to publish my files). The brackets contain the word groupings and the number on the right is the amount of tweets that grouping appeared in:

How to practice data science use case interviews?,14,39,False,False,False,datascience,1498769032,True,"I am working as a data scientist for a financial company in Europe at the moment. While my daily job does involve data modelling, the technical level and understanding required are not necessarily high. Most solutions just work because there is no prior foundation to compare against. It makes me feel like I am unable to truly improve as a data scientist by just my daily work alone. It also doesn't help that I am still at junior level, and while I have theoretical background on most algorithms, I find it difficult to know when to apply which technique, what kind of data works best with it, or how to determine the best metric to optimize.

After some quick searches, use case interview questions (especially those from the big tech companies like facebook or airbnb) really sparked my interest. [Here](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Facebook-Interview-RVW14402094.htm) are some examples. I found myself struggling to come up with reasonable answers for most questions. 

In the process, I found this book http://datascientistjobinterview.com/ which looks like exactly what I am seeking but there are not many reviews available for the book, which makes me a bit hesitant.

My goal is not just to pass some interviews. I want to improve my overall data science and analytical abilities, so I can come up with and give reasoning for solutions for most industry problems that appear in interviews.

What would you advise me to do? Take a look at the book above, or participate in some Kaggle competitions, or something else?

Thanks in advance."
Which masters degree is better for getting jobs in data science/analytics: MS Statistics or MS Computer Science? Why?,11,3,False,False,False,datascience,1498772218,True,

I am a fifth year college student entering my last quarter. I am graduating with a CS/Bioinformatics Degree and I hope to enter into the data science industry after I graduate.

Finishing a minor would take at least an extra quarter and maximum two extra quarters. What do you guys think about the benefits of getting this minor?"

Data Science internship interview questions,3,6,False,False,False,datascience,1498796559,True,"Howdy. So I have a scheduled phone interview for a data science internship role at a large NYC company. my first phone interview was yesterday but it wasn't really a technical interview, she mostly asked stuff like what I like the most about data science, why I applied, what data science worthy projects have I world on, etc..

I was wondering what I could be expecting from this interview call which is going to be from a technical hiring manager.
Also how different are data science interviews from regular software engineering ones?

[Question] Minimal sample size for k-means clustering to be valid as a comparison to a larger population?,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1498808405,True,"I assume this is a some-what unusual question. I'm not experienced using k-means clustering, so excuse my ignorance. 

 



I have a set of 15k images, that I wish to cluster into 'visually similar images'. That is, I wish to cluster them into groups that, for humans, appear to be similar. ""humans"" being the key-word. I would ask human observers to judge how visually similar each set of 2 images appears, and use this judgement as the distance between these 2 images. (i.e. on a range of 0-10, 0 being not at all, 10 being identical, how similar are these images? > 0 being infinite distance, 10 being no distance)

 




In theory, I would want to collect the distance from each image compared to each other image, but using (n^2 -n)/2 would be (15k^2 -15k)/2 = 112 million distance, which would mean I'd need 100m+ human judgement. Yikes, that'd be very very very expensive. 

 


Instead I though, maybe I could do it like this*: I could take 2 or 3 smaller samples from my 15k images, each smaller sample being size around 100 images. For each separate sample, I'd collect the distances (only around 10 to 15k judgements now > affordable), and then for each sample I'd perform a cluster-analysis. Then, if the clusters are very similar, I could make the assumption that these clusters, found in each of the smaller samples, are also (to a certain extent) present in the  15k images. 

 

My question, how small or large would my 'smaller samples' need to be to do something like this?

Is Discrete Mathematics necessary for a future in Data Science?,8,2,False,False,False,datascience,1498810666,True,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but currently I'm doing a Bachelor in IT with a major in Data Science and I was wondering if having Discrete Mathematics as a subject will help me or will be required in the future.

So I just wanna know if it's worth putting all that effort into learning it cause I'll basically be starting from the beginning.."

An example of data science project in banking. Could be interesting for beginners.,8,31,False,False,False,datascience,1498841878,True,"Some time ago in another thread I was asked how data science project at my work was going. And this is the answer. I think it could be interesting for junior or aspiring data scientists. There is not much machine learning, instead most part is devoted to working with data. In fact, if you don't work on projects with deep learning, don't write algorithms by yourself or don't do some other cool and innovative stuff, chances are that this will be most part of your job as well.

An introduction is in order. I am a junior data scientist in Russia; previously I have worked ~4 years as an IT-analyst in ERP-system implementation and then deciced to change career. I have talked about my way to data science [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6df1tm/d_how_did_you_first_break_into_machine/di2hl9q/).

At first I hoped to get a job in an advanced IT-company so that I could use cool machine learning algorithms to predict whatever. The reality wasn't nice and I couldn't land a job due to serious requirements. At last I got hired by a bank and now I'm working on a project to predict probability of customer's positive reply to bank's offer.

I didn't think this at first, but the project turned out to be quite useful for my development as data scientist. There are many problems at this place of job, but at least it is relly good as a starting point.

One more important thing is that I am the only person doing machine learning in my department. Both of my bosses know some of it, but the first one uses SAS, and the other has little time to spare. So I do the project by myself and they help me with sql and with business insights.

Now for the project itself. 
The idea is the following: bank wants to offer credit cards to his clients (who already have a product in this bank). Client can reject the card, can activate it by himself or can activate it after a call from the bank (maybe they are reminding him about the card, offering better terms or saying something else).

I won't describe the project in very accurate terms so that I don't break NDA, but I'll give general description of project's stages. Also in 2011 the bank hosted a competition which was solving almost the same problem: predicting probability of customers response. Here is my jupyter notebook solving the challenge: [github link](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb) and [nbviewer link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb). As the notebook is strictly about challenge, any coincidences with my real work are pure coincidences, of course...

1) At first it it necessary to decide what exactly will the model predict. It isn't always obvious what exactly should be predicted. The discussion can take many days. Also the prediction should be actionable - I mean that business should be able to do something based on the prediction. This stage is crucial. Also accuracy metric needs to be defined, usually it is dictated by business needs.

2) After this starts data collection step. At first it is necessary to decide which data will be used. Another point is that you can't take all the data. Companies keep data for a long time, you can easily get millions of rows. So there are technical limitations. Also, are you sure that people behaved last year the same as in current year? And two years before? And 5 years? Choose the data carefully. And often you have to optimize sql queries - CTE, careful joins, reasonable filters and so on. This can decrease query run time significantly.

3) Now you can start working with data, this will take most of the time. I won't describe this step here, the notebook is about it. I just want to point that while notebook simply brushed some areas (like calculation correlations), in reality you'll pay a lot of attention to them. And business limitations are necessary. You may have to include some variables and to drop others. You could be able to create new variables or not. And so on.

Learn to do fancy tricks. In the notebook you can see an interesting way of splitting a continuous variable into bins using Decision Trees. Some people do it manually using their expert opinion. If the person is truly expert or has a great (and working) intuition - wonderful. Otherwise it could be a good idea to use some optimization.
If it is possible, automate the tasks and write functions. There are some examples in the notebook, but you'll need much more. For example, there is a function to select the best split for continuous variables. It is good... but will you use it each time for each variable? Surely, you may do it once for each variable or for most important of them, but doing it each time will be slow. It is better to write a function, which takes a list of columns and transforms all of them.
Do you need to plot a lot of similar graphs with different variables? Create some interactive plot (plotly or ipywidgets in python).

4) At last it is time for machine learning. In such a project you won't have a lot of freedom. Banks are binded with a lot of regulations, among them transparency. So it is likely that model has to be interpretable. This means that each variable should have a coefficient showing how much it contributes to the result. So no deep learning, no cool models. In fact logistic regression is a most likely choice. Though even with this you have some possibilities: tune parameters, choose the variables and so on.

5) Penultimate step is reporting. Having a model isn't enough, you need to show how it works and which results does it produce. Build excel report, make it nice and understandable. Add graphs and be ready to explain everything in it.

6) At last arrives the production step. So you have predicted probabilitied of positive response for customers. Maybe you can simply give the predictions to your colleagues and they will make decisions based on them; or you could need to work further and do something with this data."

So here is my question, do these skills hold a good value? I'm heading to Uni to study for an MSc where I hope to do a module in Information Retrieval and Data Mining, Graphics based learning and NLP. Are there any other areas that are particularly good for this sort of work? I'm just thinking that I really enjoy this currently and if there are ways to improve it I would love to find them out. Other than learning maybe JS in order to deal with the various JS blockades put up by websites I can't think of many ways to really make what I do better.

Any advice is very welcome, thank you."

How do I take advantage of this unique situation I'm in to make sure I am employable as a Data scientist in the future?,4,8,False,False,False,datascience,1498943863,True,"Current situation - Got my first ""REAL"" job as an 'ETLish type developer at a marketing company. Before this I went through a coding boot camp and had a couple side projects I was doing after the boot camp until I got the job.  
  
Anyways, so my current job is doing ETL work but it's not traditional ETL, more like cleaning/matching data for different clients helping them with some type of analysis usually. We mostly deal with marketing companies or departments so most of the data I deal with is customer info, prospects etc. So I got hired in the same day as the first data scientist at the company who is technically the ""Director of Analytics"". So he will actually be building a DS team over the next couple years or so.  
  
In my interview I told them I want to be a data scientist in the future and that has been a goal for me for since I started learning about data science. So my goal is to transition to a data scientist role within the company as he is building up the team. So the best part about this is since he is in the process of getting an environment setup and things like that he has been showing me alot of the data science work he does and how to do it. I've been reading some intro to ML books and trying to apply some stuff to the data we have (We have tons of data) and I've been meeting with him weekly to go over the things I learn in the book and data science topics. I'm already in the process of making a NLP model that will classify some fo the custom orders we get so our company can get a better view of whats really going on.
  
One thing I don't want to do is fall into a ""data analyst"" role and more towards data science. So what skills should I focus on to make that would make me be considered more data science than a data analyst? As far as I understand these 2 titles overlap a bit but data science is more focused on predictive analytics, building models and things like that where an analyst is more exploratory analysis. So what skills/knowledge should I know to make me employable as a data scientist in the future. I pretty much have access to all the data we have so should I keep just trying to build models that add value to the company or customers as I'm learning from home? I went to a comm college for 2 years but didn't finish the degree so I'm scared that if I were to leave this company it could be hard for me to find work as a data scientist but I know I can learn and do most things with the available libraries out there. Say I built models that were successful and accomplished some cool things with projects could I get hired as a data scientist in a  year or 2 without the mathematical background and degree?  
  
Sorry long post just want to make sure I focus on the right skills while I have unique opportunity I'm in and have a mentor that is open to helping me.  
 
 Thanks guys!"

Predict New Customer Electricity Usage,10,6,False,False,False,datascience,1498962405,True,"Hi,

I have been tasked with building a model that can predict (or try to) a new customer's electricity usage for the next 12 months, without any prior data on their historical usage!

This is incredible hard to do due to the huge variations between individuals and there is very limited data when a customer joins to effectively do this. 

I was wondering if anyone else has been asked to model something that you know just can't be done accurately and how you went about it? 

Secondly, how would you go about modelling this? I figured something Bayesian so I can easily model the confidence around the estimate. 

So far a very basic linear model returns a r squared of 12%, not very good and makes me think its not worth spending much more time on it and using a simple weighted average."

What is the name of this function?,2,4,False,False,False,datascience,1498995410,True,"I'm making a generalized assumption about the maximum amount of money in an account based on severely limited data of individual transactions above or below a certain amount.

For example, if the amount of *deposit* transactions above $5 in my dataset is 57:

`
> sum(data1$Value_IN.ETH. > 5)
[1] 57
`
and 5x57 = $285
then I know based on just this evidence that the account has at least had $285 deposited in it or more.

Similarly, if I do 
`
> sum(data1$Value_IN.ETH. > 400)
[1] 1
`

then I know based on just this evidence that the account has at least had $400 in it or more.

Lastly, if I do
`
> sum(data1$Value_IN.ETH. > 1)
[1] 181
`

Then I know based on  just this evidence that it has had at least $181 deposited into it or more.

I am trying to figure out, in a given instance where a random value of the amount of transactions greater than or equal to produces the highest value.

For example even though there is only one transaction above $400, any user knowing that there is at least 1 transaction above $400 can estimate with perfect accuracy a minimum account value higher than any user who only knew there were 57 transactions above $5 and any user who only knew there were 181 transactions above $1.

But suppose there is a user x who knows there are 28 transactions above $100. This user would know with certainty that the account has had at least $100 deposited into it 28 times, or 2,800$, a much higher estimate than anyone else so far. How do I find x in my dataset using R, and how do I define x in one line, or a few lines of code?"

Automated data cleaning and formatting questions,4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1499037578,True,"Hi all,

I am working on a script to automatically clean and structure data that comes from a variety of sources into some uniform format.

I will be receiving spreadsheets from each source that will contain a selection of the following fields (*** indicates data that will always be present):

- First and last name (in the same cell or separate cells)***
- Social security number
- Employee number (not necessarily all numeric digits)
- Address (all in one cell or split over multiple)
- Paycheck size (summed over the month or broken down into pay periods)***
- Work location
- Job type
- Hours worked
- Hourly wage
- Other random garbage data

The formatting and composition of the data can vary dramatically from source to source,and column titles may or may not exist. However each source will likely format the data, at the very least, in a similar format each time we receive it. 

I have broken down the process into several steps:

1) Identify the data field in each column.

2) Group the data fields by entry.

3) Scrap the garbage data and format each entry uniformly so they can then be read in by a different piece of software.

I am using python and am currently on step one. Fields like SSN and monetary values can be easily identified using regular expressions, but I'm running into trouble with values like name, employee number, and address. I'm thinking that machine learning might be the way to go for these values, but I'm having trouble getting started identifying the features I want to use.

Has anyone worked on a project like this before or have any advice on how to get started ?

Thanks!

**TLDR** 

I get spreadsheets from many sources with different types of personal data and I want to identify which columns contain which class of data so I can clean the spreadsheets. Any advice?"

- AWS Solutions Architect Associate

[Meta] How do you feel about user flair?,10,11,False,False,False,datascience,1499125843,True,"While I am [working on content](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/wiki/beginner) for the subreddit sidebar/wiki, one simple content addition that occurred to me is user flair in the subreddit.  User flair is just images and/or text that goes next to a person's name when they post in the subreddit, not link flair which is a larger discussion.

Anyways, I would like to know how people feel about it.  Basically, here are the questions I have:

1. **Should we have user flair at all?**  
*(Note: If not, you can skip the rest of the questions.)*

2. **Should users be able to assign their own flair, or should it only be assigned by mods?**  
If assigned by mods, this could either by a case by case basis, or there could be a verification process like in AskScience or AskHistorians.

3. **What kind of flairs should we have?**  
Off the top of my head, I think flair could relate to any of the following: experience level, specialization, role, interest, reason for being in the subreddit, etc.  Or it could just be something fun.

4. **What should flairs look like?**  Flairs can take a lot of shapes and sizes, with images and/or text that may have customizable parts that can be edited by the user (if allowed).

Main outsourcing risks and how to avoid them?,0,2,False,False,False,datascience,1499150025,False,
"Is it easier to break into the field if one is stronger in math over programming, or if one is stronger in programming over math.",10,7,False,False,False,datascience,1499154536,True,"I am a math undergrad, who is minoring in computer science and have been looking into the field of data science. I have seen that the math courses that people recommend most are linear algebra, calculus, and numerical analysis, with some stats peppered in. I will be taking 2 proof based linear algebra courses in my undergrad, and hopefully a graduate level analysis course next fall. 

That being said to do well in these courses I have to devote a lot of time to my math classes, and leaves me with little time to allocate to strengthening my programming skills. So I am wondering if even though I may not spend enough time on programming, will I be able to transition over if I have an adequate background in math?


Edit: I have thought about math grad school, and my adviser suggested the grad level analysis course next fall. Would that be a useful course for a data science career? The reason I ask is because I have seen a few posts mentioning the theory of probability would be helpful, and I know that is backed off analysis.

I don't have a lot of experience with cleaning data/NLI and am a bit worried about creating a messy data pipeline as a consequence. The datapoints in the database have a label but the labels were not applied in a consistent way, so datapoints in the same category have different labels like this:

I have a personal request to make. I am a Master's student in USA, having almost completed my courses in Data Science and Engineering, although under EE track not CS track. I have taken courses in Machine learning, Probability, Statistics, NLP and am looking forward to completing my masters by getting some work experience through and internship. I know how hard it is to crack an internship and I am trying my best and giving interviews. 

Here is my request, I seem to find myself uncomfortable in a corporate environment. I have been involved in social work since 8th grade - volunteering at orphanages, slums, old-age homes etc and nothing makes me feel better than helping someone out every single day. Can you all guide me so I can merge both of these worlds together. I know and believe that data can help us solve crucial problems in education, healthcare and in fact any field. How do I look for entry data science roles in such organisations working for social good. Please let me know your thoughts, any organisations which work for such causes, anything at all. Thank you good people! 

PS - I don't have anything against corporates, I just want to add more meaning to my work and life. I am only 23 and I know first I should build my skills and get some work experience. But I feel like if I want to bring about a change, I should start now. 
I am also super shy, so I find it difficult to discuss this with friends and family, especially when people my age don't seem to understand what I believe in. "
Getting a bachelors in data science - where do I go from here?,16,2,False,False,False,datascience,1499208051,True,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently following a bachelors degree in data analytics  - it's a combination of Computer Science, Math, Statistics, and some Economics at my school in the United States. I only have about 1 year till I graduate and I feel totally unprepared going out into the real world. I was taught basic R in my program but it wasn't taught efficiently so it's hard for me to say that I even learned the basics. I have a decent understanding of Java. Don't know any python yet. I need some advice as to what I should learn before school starts again in September. And where I should go about to learn this. Thanks for your help!"
Any guide to DS from scratch?,1,3,False,False,False,datascience,1499220612,True,"Hi, I'm new to the whole data science thing and I just started interning at a advertising company's data analysis spot. I have some experience with Java, Python, and C.   
The project manager gave me a quick run-down of what they do here. He covered some stuff that I should learn in the next couple weeks (it's a 2.5 month internship). I don't really know where to start learning. Here's the general picture:  
- They are a advertising group that is divided into 3 sectors, Front-End Development, Server-Side Development, and Data Analysis. I'll be in the Data Analysis group.  
- He covered the following program/languages/packages that they commonly use. Flume, Kafka, HDFS, Yarn, MapReduce, Hive, Spark, HBase, NoSQL.   
- Since I'm one of their very first interns (it's a small company started a couple years ago) they don't really have too much experience in mentorship, that's why I'm asking online as well.  
- From what I've seen in the past 2 days, they mostly use Python/Java/Scala to write their code.  
Honestly I'm just a bit overloaded as it's a ton to take in, I'd appreciate if I could get maybe a walkthrough to help learn everything I need. Preferably free resources.  
I'm just hoping by the end of the summer I can work on a couple projects, maybe some individual projects, build portfolio, and overall learn how to be a data analyst.  
After the summer I'll be entering my 2nd year in college as a Computer Science major with Applied Math, Stats, and Economics minors. However, given the amount of credits I have, I'll be graduating within 3 years so I'd like to get as much work experience as possible. Thanks!"
Math textbook for data science,8,5,False,False,False,datascience,1499221774,True,I started getting interested in learning pretty much all I can on data science but I would like to refresh/learn some math.

Interning as a data engineer and looking for resources to learn basic concepts of data science given my experience and knowledge.,3,9,False,False,False,datascience,1499223462,True,"Hi :) 

So as it says in the title, I'm interning as a data engineer (graduating in December with a computer engineering major.) Currently I'm writing applications in python/pyspark to ingest and integrate data into into AWS . I have some knowledge of dataframes thanks to the experience I've had with pyspark but no experience whatsoever with analysis of said data since I'm doing the back-end work for the analytics team. That being said, I was wondering what the best resources are to move forward. I'm really interested in big data analysis but the amount of resources listed here are overwhelming so maybe knowing my background will help you suggest some.

In terms of programming, I would say I have a fair amount of experience. In terms of statistical experience, I don't have much. I'm very much an interactive learner, so if there are any jupyter notebooks that you know of that go through the very basic statistical concepts alongside code using python libraries such as pandas and numpy that would be super helpful. If that doesn't exist, a really good book describing the statistics I would need to know would be great too.

Thanks for listening and I'm all ears for anything you have to say!

Calculating Risk: Can this done with probability? If not how?,8,1,False,False,False,datascience,1499608153,True,"Lets say I have 30 products that are offered to our customers.  I bundle those products into 3 Bundles of 10.

The Risk:
The customer can stand pat as is, but if he opts into the bundling program.

The customer has to buy the entire bundle. He also cancels products in the other bundles that he does not buy.  He can buy all 3.

So, a customer could be heavily spending in bundle C and sign up for Bundle A and drops all product C's products. causing a net lose in revenue.

**DataSet**
10,000 customers. different penetration rates amongst the 30 products.  All products are subscription based billed once a month, with revenue data dating back two years. so i can find trend in penetration rates.

**Assumption**
I have an assumption/estimate of how many customers will opt into each bundle. but, not which of the 10,000.

**Question**
Is there a way to quantify risk here using probability?

I mean if we have 10,000 customers and 15% are expected to opt into Bundle A.  We will suffer loses in B and C, but that depends on which 15% of are customers opt in. As some could have alot of products in B and C, some may have none.

Basically, is there a way to calculate **Expected Loss** from this issue?

The reason I ask here is that this seems like something a monte carlo or bayeson stats could solve.

Im good at self learning, but need some direction of where to learn here.

Thanks!"

Using the sales of previous two days to predict sales of 3rd day?,3,4,False,False,False,datascience,1499636260,True,"A beverage company is interested in minimizing the days when their stuff are not being sold in stores.

Two reasons for zero daily sales are:

1. Item is not on store shelf due to poor management, this creates missed sales opportunities.


2. Item is on store shelf, but no one bought it.

The company is interested in scenario 1, to pin point stores that have bad management.

The data contains daily sales for 1000 stores, for a whole year, for 10 different products. So for each product, each store, there are 365 days worth of daily sales data. A ""0"" means it was not sold on that day.

The company also sent out people to visit stores daily so we have labels of when a product is on the shelf, and when it is not.

I want to build a logistic regression model to analyze the days when 0 sales occurred for each product/each store, and classify whether it's due to scenario 1, or scenario 2.

Currently, my predictors are product ID, days of the week (Mon, Tue..), size of the store shelf dedicated to a product, ...
but since the sales of previous couple of days can have a huge effect on whether something will no longer be on the shelf, I plan to include sales of the previous day, and also the sales of the day before that in my model.

Problem is, the sales of previous few days can be correlated. Will this cause problem in my logistic model?

What recommendations/advice do you have? Any comments would be appreciated.

In addition to user flair, general moderator duties and various minor changes to the sidebar and wiki, I have been spending time behind the scenes developing content and thinking about the general direction of the subreddit.  At some point it occurred to me that our subreddit has a unique advantage over others.  

**We are a subreddit made specifically of individuals who can use data science to improve our subreddit.**  More than that, we can use our skill set to help develop the entirety of the larger, loosely affiliated Data Science community of subreddits (which I will henceforth call the **Data Science Network**).

To that end, I have started using the reddit API to collect data and perform analyses of interest.  Already, these analyses have helped determine which subreddits should appear on the sidebar, and which users should be given User Flair.

Eventually, I hope to look into questions of user churn/retention, user/post overlap between subreddits, topic modeling, semantic analysis, etc.  In the meantime though, I will just be using analysis where I can.

Where should I go next with my career?,4,5,False,False,False,datascience,1499776912,True,"Hi all, firstly I'm really sorry for yet another career post on this subreddit, but all the career posts on here usually get great replies so I'm hoping someone can help me. 

To give you a bit of background, I was an average student and moved abroad to study marketing at university, completing my BA degree 2/3 years ago. I started working in marketing as an account manager but was always most interested in the analysis aspect of each campaign. I moved roles to a very large global company but still within marketing, in the hopes of doing something more analytical. Essentially I wanted a purely analytical role, so I told the business of my intentions and that I would like to transfer to the analytics team. 

This was back in October 2016. Since then I've completed courses online to learn python and SQL, and back in March there was an opening in the analytics team and I got the role. My current role is more of a data analyst than a data scientist, where I focus mostly on historical data and finding patterns/trends to generate insight for different teams, but it's towards data science that I want to move. I've completed courses on python for data science, and in the last few weeks I've managed to use pandas and other modules in my role in order to start getting some practice in this field, but I'm still lacking a lot of skills.

In the next few months I will start building my first model which will be really good practice, but I'm wondering what I can do in my free time to start building on skills that make a data scientist. I've been touching on the subject of machine learning in my own free time, but I feel like I am lacking the mathematical background to understand it in depth. I'm okay with the technological side of the role at the moment, but it's the mathematics and the logic behind data science that I really want to develop, in order to be able to make the move in the next few years.

Given my background, where do you think I should be focusing at the moment, and what are some good resources to achieve that? Thanks in advance"

Classifying a trip as risky,4,3,False,False,False,datascience,1499873635,True,"I am currently an intern at an insurance company working with telematics data. I haven't been given much direction and feel lost. I have the trip data from a single driver to play with. 

It contains, gps info (speed,location,time,date,day,rural/urban,timezone,daylightsavings,state,zip,...), behavior factors (seatbelt y/n speeding y/n, stopped,...), harsh driving info (was there a harsh break or accel or decel, etc at this specific ping), and lastly, the info of top 3 locations spent at with distance from them.

I have done eda and found out interesting things,for example, this particular driver seems to drive harshly at lunch hours (maybe driving while eating? Or maybe just traffic) and seems to speed mostly in one state on a single road. I even built a couple models to predict harsh counts and whether or not they will be speeding. I feel as though I am not utilizing this data nearly enough, though.

I am asking for any suggestions/tips/insights as to what I should explore next. I thought about attempting to classify each trip as risky or not or trying to do an association rules, but I am unsure exactly how I would do this properly. Any help would be appreciated. Criticism is also appreciated! This is my first taste of data science outside the classroom and I want to make the most of it. 

Edit: In this particular case I have no info of whether or not a crash occurs. I am told in the future we will be able to combine that information, however, I am told to explore until then.

Confidence Intervals for Promotional Uplifts.,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1499875103,True,"Hi,

I'd love to get some thoughts on how to devise a way to get confidence intervals for uplift values.

Let's say a promotion for a product (1 USD off purchase) is being sent out to 10,000 people (Test Group). The Test Group consists of the entire population  eligible for this promotion minus the control group consisting of 1000 people.

Here's how I am currently calculating the uplift -

Pre Period - 52 weeks
Post Period (Redemption Period) - 10 weeks

I am currently calculating uplift by Measuring the difference in Redemption Period Spend for Test Group - Control Group weighted down by a factor accounting for pre-period differences between Test & Control.

Promotional Uplift = Redemption Period Test Spend - (Redemption Period Control Spend * ( Pre Period Test Spend / Pre Period Control Spend ) )

Now, I am just wondering how to apply a 95% confidence interval to this uplift value. Would appreciate any suggestions!

Opinions on this graduate program?,6,2,False,False,False,datascience,1499877730,True,"Good evening everyone! I've been lurking this sub for a while and while I know that the general consensus here is to lean more towards established degrees I'd like to know your opinions on this program:

What worries me is that the name of some of the courses are too general and ""catchy"" (I will have taken most of what's in the first year anyway by the time I graduate, even if at an undergrad level). I like the compulsory internship, which from what I know might also take place as a Research Assistant at the University's Institute for Data Science and Analytics. I'm geared towards the Data Science track.

To add some context, I attend the BSc in Economics and Computer Science at the same Uni and thus know (and like a lot) the faculty and will probably talk with my professors once lectures start again, but at the same time I'd like to start thinking in advance about the matter because I'm considering taking some extra classes (in mathematics) as a non-degree seeking student if I decide not to stick with this in order to increase my chances at getting at a good program elsewhere.

/u/weodude has expressed interest in doing this, so I will voluntell him that he is responsible for the inaugural Question of the Week post.  I was hoping to do these every Monday, so /u/weodude, how does aiming for the 24th of July sound?

If you are interested in answering a question of the week, I might start a google doc listing the schedule.

**Simple Questions**

At times, the sub is flooded with similar questions about Master's programs, transitioning into the field, and other smaller problems. I want to encourage these questions to be asked, but I don't want to flood the feed with the same question over and over.  

On Wednesdays, a new post will be stickied for Simple questions.  If you have a question about:

* Etc

Please ask them there.  

All of this is tentative, so if you have any issues, recommendations, questions, please let me know.  This is all an attempt to make the community better for you guys, so your opinion is important to the mod team.

I currently work in the environmental science/hydrology field, but do a decent amount of work in Python/R/GIS/VBA (especially GIS + R) and have a solid background in stats. I have a BS and an MS in water resources + GIS certificate (not engineering degrees...).

I'm not an engineer and because of this feel that I may have trouble advancing further in my current position. I certainly **need** to brush up on my calculus skills, but I was wondering if this program would be attractive for getting started in data analytics/eventually as a data scientist.

I’m about to start a DS fellowship-type program in the Fall with a goal of getting hired around October-December, so I have this summer to get as far as possible before my program starts.

Along with working on projects, I wanted to understand the models better beyond simply running them in Python, etc. I have two textbooks, [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), and I’ve read a couple of chapters into both.

My question: I’ve mainly heard professionals recommend reading ISL, but had some also mention ESL. I have the quantitative background to understand ESL, but the material is slower to read, and the problems are difficult. I enjoy reading the book and working through the exercises, but the main issue is that it takes time - plus, I still am aiming to build some projects and/or a blog, so it’s not the only thing I’ll be doing.

CS Undergrad becoming a Data Scientist,4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1500154741,True,"Dont know if this is the right place to post this. But. Still. 
Currently a first year undergrad CS student. Haven't learnt much other than discrete math basics and basic programming. I really don't feel like becoming a ""dev"" even though how fashionable it may sound/be. Was looking through other job options and found data science as a very interesting topic. 
•How much programming is involved?
•Can I get a entry level job in relating field as a CS Undergrad or do I have to do MS or PhD?(My university has courses like Data Mining, Machine Learning, Advanced data structures etc. as upper year choices in bachelors degree)
•Is work mostly based on algorithms or what? I have seen 30min-1hr long videos on overview of Data Science and as interesting as it sounds, I have a feeling that it's actually going to be really intimidating. What kind of work is done? All I know is that ""data will be taken, analyzed using algorithms to produce results and predictions"". Is this it and if yes, how is this done? Like writing an algorithm and processing data through it? Would love a brief overview. 
•Apart from data science, I really love databases, any idea on careers in that?

[Meta] The Future of r/datascience and its moderation,6,67,False,False,True,datascience,1500173032,True,"As u/__compactsupport__ mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6n7r3o/what_about_data_science_interests_you/), we have been looking towards discerning what r/datascience should be and how it sets itself apart from similar subreddits.  To that end, I wanted to present my view of the subreddit going forward, and how that will inform our moderation decisions in the future.

 

**What is the purpose of having a Data Science subreddit?**

The primary purpose of having a Data Science subreddit is to provide a place for DS practitioners (both amateur and professional) to discuss and debate topics relating to the field/industry.

 

**What kinds of posts should we have in r/datascience?**

* General Data Science Community/News discussion
* Great examples of DS, given in a context that helps educate and inform
* Industry/Career questions and advice (absolute beginners would be directed to the wiki)
* Perspectives of DS community, including open questions, critical comments, and AMAs
* Networking of DS professionals
* Fun DS trivia and ephemera
* Posts about non-commercial tools/platforms/courses, given context
* Posts about commercial tools/platforms/courses, with approval, if setup correctly for discussion rather than advertising

*Note that the above list will likely inform future link flair categories.*

 

**How does r/datascience differ from similar subreddits?**

* r/MachineLearning
* r/deeplearning

These subreddits are more focused on the academic, theoretical side of machine learning. Our subreddit should be focused more on the industrial, applied side of machine learning, statistics, and other methods. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't have posts discussing new research or results, but any academic/research material should have broad interest to DS practitioners and be placed in a proper context. Simply posting a link to a paper or blog discussing a novel technique (or even an old one) should not be accepted, and instead directed to r/MachineLearning. Users who want to discuss such things in the subreddit should post a text post that lays out what the paper is and how they are thinking about using it in their DS work.

 

* r/statistics
* r/AskStatistics
* r/rstats
* r/pystats
* r/MLQuestions
* r/learnmachinelearning

These subreddits are mostly for asking questions and providing help for specific techniques in statistics, machine learning, R, or Python. Our subreddit can provide limited help in these areas, but shouldn't accept questions that aren't generalized to the context of a Data Science problem/project. In other words, specific discussions about how to optimize k-means should be directed to the appropriate subreddit, but discussions about whether to cluster market segments using k-means would be acceptible (assuming contextual details were included).

 

* r/DataHoarder
* r/datasets
* r/opendata
* r/visualization
* r/dataisbeautiful

These subreddits are focused specifically on data/visualizations, which while important to data scientists, are only a means to an end for us. These types of posts should be handled like with r/MachineLearning, where material should have broad interest to DS practitioners and be placed in a proper context. Simply posting a link to a fun dataset or visualization without context should not be accepted."

Invest More beyond Tools to Improve Reporting Performance,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1500349422,True,"As a type of front-end data service intended for end-users, reports in applications have received a lot of concerns about their performances.  It’s all users’ wish that parameters in and query and aggregate results out in no time. Though less than twenty seconds’ waiting time is within a tolerant range, three to five minutes will threaten to extend beyond a user’s patience with the worst product experience. 
But why is a report so slow? And how shall we optimize its performance?

Data preparation 
Usually a report in an application is developed with a reporting tool. Each time when the reporting process is slow, users tend to point their fingers at report developers or reporting tool vendors. In fact, in most cases slowness is a symptom, the real disease lies in the data preparation stage. This means data handling is already slow before the reporting stage. So it’s no use to simply optimize the report development or to push the reporting tool too hard. 
Reports are for viewing. Since the ability of our naked eye is very limited, there’s no need to let a report present a large amount of data. The descriptive computing mode the reporting tool adopts, though intuitive, is not suitable for complex computations. It’s inappropriate and pushy to let a reporting tool deal with big data computing and complex computations. Reporting tools are only good at handling the arrangement for small data sets, and simple computations. It takes not long to get them done. 
About 80% of slownesses in reporting are caused by terrible data preparation. Though a report presents only a very small amount of data, the original data for generating it could be in huge amount. It takes very long to filter and aggregate a massive volume of data to get just a small volume. A similar thing happens with a complex computation, for which the most time-consuming job is the data preparation. So data preparation is the bottleneck in trying to facilitate the report building. Ways to optimize the data preparation process are:
1. Optimizing data preparation code. Generally it is SQL code or stored procedure code to optimize. Sometimes it is the application code (when involving non-database data sources or multiple databases). 
2. Scaling up/out the database. We can also scale up/out the database, like clustering, if there is a huge amount of data and there is nothing more for code optimization to do.
3. Employing a high-performance computing engine. We can replace traditional databases that are poor in performance or costly for certain operations with a better computing mechanism.

Report presentation stage
The computational performance problem might also happen during report presentation stage. 
A typical scenario is building a multi-source report, for which joining and aligning multiple two-dimensional data sets by the primary key, and sometimes grouping and aggregation, are needed. As the reporting tool requires that all calculations be written in the cells, the relationship between a cell and other data sets can be only expressed by dataset filtering, such as the formula ds2.select(ID==ds1.ID). The calculation has quadratic complexity. This has little impact on performance when the data amount is very small, but has serious effect if there is a bigger amount of data (say, thousands of rows) and a lot of data sets. The time it takes in performing the calculation could range from seconds to dozens of minutes. 
But the time can be significantly reduced if the calculations are handled during data preparation stage outside of the reporting tool. With data sets coming from a same database, we just write the SQL JOIN statement; if data sets come from different databases or we want to save the database from high computational pressure, we can use the HASH JOIN algorithm outside of the database. The HASH JOIN algorithm treats multiple databases as a whole and brings a much higher efficiency than the filtering join used by the reporting tool does. It achieves an almost instant response for a several-thousand-row data set. 
On the surface, the poor performance is a report-presentation-stage issue, but its solution is often found beyond the reporting tool. 
Another scenario is a grouped and aggregated report with detail rows. Its problem is the slow computation caused by the handling of a big amount of data during the report presentation stage. The solution is the same – moving the data computing out of the reporting tool. 

Data transmission
Data transmission is another bottleneck of the reporting performance.
Currently, many applications are J2EE-based, reporting tools are developed in Java, and JDBC is used for database access. The problem is that, since the performance of some popular databases’ JDBC is bad (we’ll omit the brands here), it takes fairly long for users to retrieve data even in a slightly large amount (tens of thousands of rows). Here’s a paradox: database has a light pressure and delivers quick computations, and report tool handles a relatively simple computation, yet the overall reporting process is still slow. 
Neither application vendors nor reporting tool vendors are capable of improving the database JDBC performance. What they can do is thinking of ways from outside. According to tests, data retrieval performance can be increased by several times using the multithreaded processing (a precondition is a light-loaded database). No reporting tools, however, have ever provided the parallel retrieval functionality directly (It’s difficult to make it a reporting tool function because the data segmentation plan varies with database products as well as data retrieval syntax, and thus needs to be controlled by code). Still, the solution is implementing the parallel retrieval during data preparation stage beyond the reporting tool. 

Controllable Cache
If we can cache the results of recent computations for generating a report, then when other users perform queries using the same parameters, there will be no need to re-compute the data and they can just return the results. Obviously this will enhance user experience. This kind of cache functionality is offered by many reporting tools, but not for intermediate results. Only the final result of the computations for generating a report can be cached, and different reports have separated and unconnected caches.
1. Partial caching. For certain types of reports, particularly the commonly seen multi-source reports, most of the involved original data is static (historical data) and only a small part is dynamic (current data). The lifetime of the whole-report cache data is measured by the shortest data history, which results in repeated computations. To cache a part of the data can extend its term of cache validity, and thus reducing the amount of computations. 
2. Reusability of caches. Different reports may reference the same data. But a fragmented cache mechanism for reporting will result in replicated computations over same data. If a cached computational result can be made available across all reports, the amount of computations may be considerably reduced.
Controlling cache is complicated and requires coding. It’s difficult to provide such a function within a reporting tool, but it’s relatively easy to implement it during the programmable data preparation process.

List reports
As previously mentioned, the relationship between reporting and big data isn’t as strong as many reporting tool vendors advertising big data report claim it to be. 
There’s indeed a type of list reports that can be called big data reports. A list report, which lists transaction details in a certain period of time, is frequently seen in financial sector. It features a huge amount of data across thousands of, even ten thousand, pages. The computations, however, is relatively simple, listing data, for most of the time, or summarization by groups or pages at most.
Generally reporting tools adopt a full memory storage strategy in order to manage inter-cell computations flexibly. It is very likely that the strategy will lead to memory overflow when loading a big list into the reporting tool. Besides, it takes intolerably long to retrieve and load the list.
It’s easy to think about a way of presenting data while retrieving, page by page, causing no danger of memory overflow and reducing the time users have to wait. All databases provide cursors to retrieve data out part by part. Users may flip pages on the front-end, which demands the ability of retrieving data out by random page number (i.e. by rows), but databases don’t offer the kind of API for doing so. Retrieving data with conditional filtering not only is quite slow, but can’t ensure data consistency.
There’s no better way than to get it done during the data preparation stage. We can devise two asynchronous threads: one for retrieving data from the database and buffer it to the external storage (suppose there’s too much data for the memory); and the other for receiving a front-end request and loading data from buffer by random page number (i.e. by rows) to return.

With a linear SVM on a (small) balanced class dataset I'm getting 80% accuracy. 

I balanced the classes by upsampling the minority class (120 texts) to match the majority class (180). Without doing so the SVM naively always predicted the majority class. A Bernoulli Naïve Bayes predictor also increases my accuracy in the same manner. 

As I increase the folds of a k-folds cross validation my accuracy increases. This seems like some kind of future leakage perhaps? 

For instance: 

At k=3, accuracy = 78%

k=5, accuracy = 81%

k=10, accuracy = 85%

k=20, accuracy = 91%

Masters program or full time employment?,2,2,False,False,False,datascience,1500430062,True,"I have one semester left in undergrad (graduate in December 2017) and am lost on what are some ideal next steps. I am majoring in computational modeling and data analytics with a 3.6 GPA (3.9 in major). This is a new major at my school and covers a lot of machine learning, data visualization, data collection and web scraping, calc, stats, experimental design, linear algebra, and mathematical modeling. We used R, python, and MATLAB mostly. 

The past two summers I have interned as a data analyst where I mostly created excel report, used SQL for analysis, and did some ad hoc analysis. No big data tools or statistical modeling. The coolest thing I did was create a web scraper to mine some data. The department I'm in (operations) is focused just on making sure the business is functioning and not so much about predictive models or real statistics. The company isn't mindful of data science despite having tons of data.  

My question is now what? I've considered working here full time but I feel bored messing around in excel all day. I miss implementing machine learning and creating predictive models. Unfortunately, most data science jobs I've browsed want a masters degree at the least.

 I've also looked into some data science master programs such as NC state, USC, and UVA. I'd love to attend one of these programs but I'm worried about future employment (since they're newer programs), how I'll pay for it, and if I'd be able to get in. Most of the data science programs are less than a year but upwards of $50k. Does anyone who has attended one of these programs know if I would be able to work as a TA or something?

Need a breakdown of what statistics/data intensive computing techniques I would need to solve these hackathon questions,2,2,False,False,False,datascience,1500485595,True,"Hi there. So let me preface my questions by saying I am not looking for answers to these questions. I would like the solve them on my own or programmatically. These pertain towards the hackathon that the NBA is hosting in NYC for university students.

**Basketball Analytics Questions:**

After the Golden State Warriors acquired former MVP Kevin Durant in 2016, some NBA fans speculated that the Warriors would not lose consecutive games at any point of the season.*

a) If you wanted to determine the probability that this prediction would be true (i.e., that the Warriors would never lose consecutive games at any point during an 82-game season), what is one approach (or a few approaches) you may use to solve the problem? What answer do you get? Exact answers are of course welcome, but approaches that lead to approximations (and those approximations) are fine, too (please specify the precision of your estimate). Assume the Warriors have an 80% chance of winning each and every game.

b) So, would you have agreed with that hypothesis?

c) Finally, at least what % of a team's games would a team need to be expected to win (assuming that win probability stays constant from game to game) for there to be a greater than 50% chance that the team never suffers consecutive losses at any point in the season?

**Bonus Question**:When are teams eliminated from playoff contention? Using the results for the 2016-17 regular season as a test case for your quantitative solution, please generate the date that each team was eliminated from playoff contention. We are purely looking for a date when a team was eliminated from playoff consideration, not any specific seed. 

**Business Analytics Questions:**

A term in an NBA team's lease agreement states that it must pay a penalty fee every time it fails to reach 17,000 attendees in three consecutive home games. The onerous fee has caused the team to request assistance in assessing its risk. The team estimates the probability it will reach 17,000 attendees in a home game is 75%, and each game has an equal likelihood of eclipsing the 17,000 threshold.*
a) Given the 75% likelihood of hitting that number each game, what are the odds that the team will avoid a three-game streak with attendance under 17,000 for the entire season? Please build a simple simulator to determine your answer. (Note that there are 41 regular season home games; assume each game is independent.)

b) The team has the option of pursuing an aggressive comp ticket strategy that can increase its odds of hitting the 17,000-attendee mark in every game. Suppose it wants to have a 90% chance of avoiding paying any penalty fees throughout the entire season. Assume the probability, p, of eclipsing 17,000 attendees is the same for every home game - and each game is independent. What probability p should it target in order to achieve a 90% chance to avoid paying any fees?

**TL:DR**: So it's been a while since I've covered stats or data intensive computing problems. But I've learned regression techniques, clustering techniques, and classification techniques in these courses. What types of techniques or other stats techniques would you and should you apply to each of these problems and why?

Time series detrending suggestions?,13,4,False,False,False,datascience,1500487858,True,"Hello all,

I am currently working on a project to forecast hourly electricity usage. We have variables of Actual Hourly usage data as the dependent variable and temperature, temperature squared, lagged usage by 24, 48, and 72 hours, wind speed, precipitation, dew point, cloud cover, and relative humidity as possible independent variables.

I will be doing time series regression to create an equation for hourly usage forecasts for the entire year of 2016. Data is available from 2013 until present.

The question that I hope I could get some input on is what variables should I detrend and how?

I've detrended the dependent variable using weighted averaging over seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly effects. Is differencing a better option for this variable? Or maybe another detrending technique?

My real concern though is whether or not to detrend the temperature to remove the seasonal term. However, I know temperature is a big driver of electricity usage and I'm unsure if taking the seasonal trend out would be beneficial to the model. 

An overall encompassment - what would you suggest to do on the basis of detrending before running some time series regression analysis?

I am doing a market segmentation for an insurance firm and I am struggling with what time interval to use for financial data.

I've read in books that taking data for up to half a year back is enough for most segmentations. However, the hard part of the insurance industry is that not all customers pay at the same time (monthly, quarterly, annually). Therefore, picking data from half a year back will introduce a bias in the customer's behavior. 

With this in mind, I was thinking of taking the accumulated financial information of 2016 and change my segmentation to the customers who made payments in 2016.

Let me know what you think!

I have read a lot that Machine Learning is involved in this, but where? 

Also, the Data Analysis part seems really simple. Ive seen a hack competition by an analytics company online and all we had to was the following:
-Use pandas numpy matplotlib in python
-We were given a dataset on Loan Approvals
-Made some histograms/box plots to see what actually induces a real change in the approval of loan
-Cleaned some data with null values
-Found out that most of the time Loan approvals are based on Graduate status for females and Salary for males. 

Is this really it? Idk if this seems easy to me because I like doing it or whatever I did was not actually data analysis? 

Im doing an undergrad im CS and the coding involved in the hack seemed very basic, I felt like all the functions I need could be written on a cheat sheet and I can use that to make my everyday analysis.

1. the creation and automated update of a cohort from the local population which is representative of the country as a whole, in order for statistical comparison when research projects are done. Or,

2. automated checking of output files for disclosure, data not being escaped, etc.

If there any other ideas out there which you think might fit, feel free to suggest them, I would really appreciate any pointers at this stage. I'm starting to go into panic mode! The course is 20 months long and is based around what your department does/what you do at work. So I would like to do something that benefits our service, as well as facilitates the degree."

Trying to decide on career path options and continued education to pursue,6,2,False,False,False,datascience,1500743099,True,"I'm 30, coming from an interdisciplinary background in educational program evaluation and data analysis. I'm currently an administrator in a school, but while my job was intended to be more data analysis and applied statistics, I've become more of a paper pusher. So I'm trying to decide how to get back on track while maximizing income potential.

I currently hold a M.Ed in Curriculum and Instruction. I'm looking at programs at the graduate certificate level, supplemented with MOOCs. 

UIC MESA certificate, I would be taking courses in HLM, multiple regression, multivariate analysis, and program evaluation, applied to education data. SPSS seems to be the main tool. 

Data science certificates I see have more programming courses, database architecture, and machine learning; things I'm more unfamiliar with. R, Python, etc.

These seem like very different tracks. My understanding is the main difference between PE and DS is that PE starts with questions and evaluations tend to have a start and end point while DS starts with a massive dataset and is ongoing. DS jobs I've seen tend to be in tech and retail, and tend to have a higher earning potential. Am I accurate in saying that DS jobs are less about interpreting data and answering research questions for organizational decisions as it is about using technology to make hard-to-reach data automate into practical applications? Anyone had experience trying to decide on paths similar to this?"

Currently I am interning at a large financial institution in quantitative risk and model development.  After working alongside employees with advanced degrees, I have come to realize that a MS/PHD would be best for my career aspirations.

With that said, I have been researching potential programs and I have been somewhat stymied by the process.  Here are my current considerations with a sampling of the coursework:


• M.A. in Economics (Econometrics, Probability, Game Theory)

• M.S. in Statistics (Applied Regression, Statistical Consulting, Biostatistics)

• M.S. in Operations Research (Applied Stochastic Processes, Markov Decision Processes, Statistical Modelling)


For someone eyeing jr data science roles in the financial industry after graduation, would you recommend one masters program over the others?  Or alternatively did you find that certifications/projects/ranking of institution mattered more?    

Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated!

R in production environments,28,13,False,False,False,datascience,1500782937,True,"I am a java programmer by trade. Recently I have been working with R on an R&D Machine Learning project. 

I like R. Once I became familiar with the pros and cons of different classes (e.g., matrix, vs data.table vs data.frame) I found it performed very well. It was also great for R&D because it does not require compiling everything to just test one line of code.

So, lots of benefits to R!

But, I am curious. Is R used in production environments? By that, I mean as part of the business layer in large scale online web applications and web sites. Or, is R more the domain of research scientists?

If the latter is the case, then what are the most common ways of deploying ML algorithms in production? Are Weka and Hadoop better for integrating into production?

I recently successfully interviewed for a Data Scientist position. Here is some information on the interview and how I think I landed the job.,56,163,False,False,False,datascience,1500788367,True,"**Phone Screening**

I was asked some very basic questions: If I had any experience with modelling, any experience with Python or R, and why I was looking for a new job.  I think so long as you answer these questions in the affirmative, then you will be fine.  The most important part is to come off as likeable. Make a joke, seem like a human.  After all, they want someone they will like to work with.

**Interview 1**

This was an interview with an HR manager and the successful candidate's manager.  Here are some questions I was asked:

>Why did you leave your last job.

Be honest.  I said I wasn't being challenged and that I wasn't valued (which was the truth).  This is also a great segue into seeing if this position is different.  

>If you could spend 5 hours getting your model to 90% accuracy, and another 5 getting it to 95% accuracy, would you?

This is a tough question and is probably designed to see if you get the business perspective of data science.  The right answer (to me) is ""it depends on how much that 5% is worth"".  If additional accuracy means hundreds of thousands of more dollars, you bet your ass I am going to  squeeze every ounce of accuracy out of it.  



>Tell me your experience with productionalization

I literally have 0 experience productionalizing.  Not everyone is well equipped with every skill set.

**Interview 2**

They gave me a take home regression problem.  The question asked me to report some simple regression metrics.  I used the opportunity to showcase my scientific ability as well as tell a story.  Don't be afraid to show your model's weakness.  They probably aren't looking for you to be perfect.

There were a couple of soft skill questions from HR that don't generalize well, but that was mostly it.

**Questions I asked**

>Can I contribute to open source?

With some places *AHEM BANKS AHEM AHEM* whatever you create is owned by them.  Now, I don't plan to put our company's library on CRAN, but if I create a library to solve a specific problem, I would feel like I am obligated to share it with the community

>What is the difference between data science and statistics?

People don't fucking know what they want a data scientist for.  They don't even know what a data scientist does.  I just want to see that they have thought out what the role is for and how it will effect the business.

>What does success look like in the role?

Just to set my expectations

>I am worried that I will not fit in because my personality is geared towards research rather than corporate culture.  Do you think that will be a problem?

The one thing I hate is ""business as usual"", mostly because I don't fit that very well.  If you have concerns, you should let that be known.  The HR manager was very glad I brought it up.  If they like you, they want to make sure you like them too.

A day later, I got the offer.  I plan on taking it, and soon I'll be a lead data scientist :)"

Career advice needed.,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1500816535,True,"Hi. I'm from an engineering background. Electrical. So some maths not so much stats.

For the past year I have been working for an IT solutions firm, that provides IT-business solutions to large and small scale clients. I have been mainly reporting and building dashboards on Qlik tools, primarily Qlik Sense. 

Here comes a couple of questions, but before that I'll tell you:


What I know:

In this job, I do enjoy understanding the business issues, reading about and understanding the industry, understanding the company's workflow, and the questions they want answered. But all of that usually entails building a data model and presenting what can be derived from their data onto a dashboard to give them their figures. It does not for the most part pose a challenge and neither does this sort of job put me in the position of advising the business as to what decisions they could make to potentially solve their issues and improve their current standing. I am merely reporting what I can see from their data.

Which is the part that I do not enjoy so much. So I was thinking of switching up.

From what I understand about the business analytics spectrum, the next stage of business analytics, after dashboarding, is predictive modelling. Which i enjoyed being a part of in one of my projects, this part was handled by a different team but due to my curiosity I was in on every step of the way.

So far I had been working on business intelligence, but this part deals with data science along with business analytics. I'm going to call this business analytics from now on.


What I believe:

I believe since ML and predictive modelling in R and Python don't really give a very presentable picture, there must be some tools or software that these are used in conjunction with in the actual industry to study the insights given by these methods. Maybe Qlik sense or other such BI tools.

Is that really so?

If not, then, what do, say, retail stores or FMCG companies, that utilize such models to predict how much stock they need for the 4th of July sale use to report, understand and drive business decisions.


What I don't know:

I recently completed a course on inferential statistics in order to get started with machine learning. Next step in my view would be starting any of the machine learning courses online, accompanied by learning R/Python.

Please tell me if I am on the right track with my pursuit of business analytics and machine learning.

Another question that I have is what sort of profiles exist in the market regarding this kind of business analytics, like financial analyst, retail, consulting etc.

There are further research oriented jobs in this field, if we leave out business analytics from ML, but I think that would require a higher degree in those fields, which I may be considering. What sort of jobs will I be looking at if I pursue an MS in data science?


Sorry for the wall of text. I have a few more questions but I think this much is enough for now. I'll followup if someone replies to this post.

I'd like some feedback on my project: handwritten digit recognition online,10,1,False,False,False,datascience,1500817490,True,"I'm quite new to the field of Data Science, so I try my best to improve my skills. I have spend last several weeks working on a project which could not only be added to my portfolio, but also give me some practical skills and a story to tell.

Here is the [link](https://digits-draw-recognize.herokuapp.com/).

This is a little site (also working on mobile), where a user can draw a digit and machine learning models will try to recognize it. There are two models: FNN written on numpy and CNN on Tensorflow. Both were inspired by cs231n. But models don't simply recognize the images, they are also trained on new images to improve their accuracy.

I collected the data by myself - I drew 1000 images, ~100 of each digit. Then I created the models and trained them on this data. This was my first experience in:

* Collecting, processing and storing the data by myself;
* Building a site and using Flask;
* Buidling models, which can be trained on additional data;
* Working with Amazon cloud;
* Augmenting images;
* Building new good TF structure for my purpose;

I have described the models and the project workflow on site, you can find the links in the navigation bar at the top.

Masters and Side Learning,3,6,False,False,False,datascience,1500909260,True,"Hey all,

I'm currently working towards applying for an online masters program so that I can earn a degree whilst continuing to work, and I'm looking for a bit of advice. 

I have searched through this subreddit and others trying to compare a masters in applied stats vs. a masters in CS, and I'm getting stuck. I've gone through textbooks and MOOCs for learning stuff like R and Python, as well as stats, data analysis, and machine learning, and I'm currently in a Calc III course, and have a linear algebra one lined up right after, as I was initially  leaning towards the stats degree (either from Colorado State or Penn State) which required those as per-requisites, and my bachelors in Health Information Management only required up to Calc II. 

My initial thoughts were that a stronger foundation in math, stats, and how to design and run experiments would've been the better choice to actually be able to apply data science and machine learning to problems, while actually learning the tech on the side/on the job if possible. But now I find myself jumping back and forth now between doing that or vice versa, i.e. getting the online masters in CS from Georgia Tech while doing more stats on the side (also while doing mini-projects in any free time I have no matter the scenario). I read somewhere in my search that getting a stats degree online is a lot of teaching yourself anyway, so I'm unsure if it's worth it now, 

All 3 programs interest me, but as of right now I believe a career towards more machine learning engineering and possibly AI is what I'd like to do, which both stats programs really don't go into much past ""Statistical Learning and Data Mining"", which is why the electives at GT jumped out at me, but I'm just second-guessing if I'd be a bit lost without the statistical foundations for those courses.

I know this question has been asked multiple times here, but I'm just looking some advice to get me out of paralysis-by-analysis.

EDIT: I think another viable option may be the Applied Statistics Graduate Certificate from Penn State to test the waters and *then* move onto GT or continue on with Applied Stats"

I found out that my job as HRIS Analyst-HR Analytics and Reporting position will end in 9 months. I was really hoping this job would start my Data Analyst and eventually Data Scientist career. That might have been naïve, but my time in this job (11 months) hasn’t been fruitful in helping create that foundation.

My question is, can I land a Data Analyst position as-is and learn on the job, if not, is there a job below Data Analyst that I can get, that has a path to Data Analyst? I will be working on my SQL skills and implementing Workday HCM/Workday Analytics over the next 9 months, but with school, I won’t be able to learn R or Python in the meantime.

"How familiar with Computer Science does a ""Type A"" Data Scientist need to be?",7,2,False,False,False,datascience,1500921732,True,"As an aspiring data scientist in college, I thoroughly enjoy Statistics and Math. However, I don't have the same passion for computer science. I'm rather apathetic towards programming, and the concepts of Computer Science don't seem as intuitive or enjoyable to me as Statistics.

From a few internet searches, I found this temperament similar to that of a Type A Data Scientist. My question is, if I desire to be more of the analytical Data Scientist, what concepts of Computer Science should I be familiar with at the bare minimum? For example, is a class in Data Structures and Algorithms (taught in C) useful> Or should I focus on other statistical and/or machine learning courses?

p.s. I realize coding is mandatory and I don't mind coding in R and using SQL, Excel, etc.. to perform analysis, but do I really need to know Computer Science concepts?

Videos to teach NGO colleagues basic 'data literacy',6,18,False,False,False,datascience,1500921981,True,"Hi everyone,

I work for a rather large nonprofit organization, and I am working to build internal change and make everyone more 'data driven' in their projects.  Many of our employees are older and perhaps not very tech literate, and many of our offices are in developing countries where the technology resources are not very new (ex: the whole office is setup on 10 year old PCs and use basic Excel sheets to run everything; its not like everyone has flashy new macbooks and playing around in Tableau all day).

I'm looking for resources, especially online videos, to help teach people basic data literacy skills.  I'm looking for two things:

**Short Teaser Videos:**  For example, TED talks about data, such as Hans Rosling's great material.  For another example, a 5 minute YouTube video that explains commons sources of Big Data in today's world.  Etc.  Less than 15 minutes, and easy to digest for non-techy people.

**Medium Length Overview Courses, cheap or free:**  For example, our employees don't need to learn Python, but it would be great for them to maybe do a few Khan Academy courses and refresh basic statistics ideas, or have them understand how to use Pivot Tables in Excel, or have them learn some basics about using Data Visualization persuasively in powerpoints.  That kind of thing, perhaps courses that are <20 hours in length, and <$50 to do.

If you have any suggestions for materials that I can compile, I would really appreciate it!  I strongly believe that making our employees more data driven and data literate can have a real, meaningful impact in our programs, and I will take any help I can get :)"

Model for optimizing commission rates?,9,2,False,False,False,datascience,1500947921,True,"I've searched this subs history and also done some lite Google searching. This post is just part of some exploring.

I've been given a new problem to solve with data. In a nutshell I'm being asked to create a model to derive an optimal commission rate for sales teams.

Purposefully keeping this as top level as possible but I could provide more details. 

Context is finance, however presumably a model to inform decisions on optimal commission rates would be industry agnostic?

I could just do a linear model and add variables like region, loan amount, term, education level, work experience etc etc. 

But then what is my target variable? Loan amount? Revenue over total loan term? Commission rate?

Exploratory analysis could be plots of commission rate and sales volume, or something else?

Is there a conventional approach to this?

Medicare Cost Reports - Is This Worth Exploring?,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1501041703,True,"To start, I'm a nursing home administrator. Recently, I received my facility's Medicare cost report for 2016, and while reviewing it (the reports are prepared at our corporate office), I realized just how much information the industry has to disclose; these reports contain a full balance sheet, a full income statement, and a statement of owners' equity. Major stakeholders are listed, as well as related companies. Over 20 years of this data [is freely available through The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/downloadable-public-use-files/cost-reports/); however, this data is presented in two multi-hundred MB CSV files for each year of data. For reference, 
[Illinois offers human-readable PDFs of their cost reports](https://www.illinois.gov/hfs/MedicalProviders/CostReports/Pages/default.aspx), but few other states do.

This seems like a huge resource for key decision makers. What do your wages look like in comparison to your competitors? Are you spending more or less than average on expenses such as food, medication, and medical supplies? What are industry trends in profit and return on equity?

I've found a handful of web sites that offer reports based on the CMS data, but more than the data itself, I'm interested in the whole process of learning to programmatically access data, creating models with said data, and then visualizing all of it.

I have minimal scientific training (college calculus, engineering stats, linear algebra, introductory CS coursework in C++), but I'm highly motivated to learn.

Wind gust forecasts - master thesis in meteorology - which algorithms to use?,1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1501078552,True,"I am currently working on my master thesis in meteorology and got into machine learning last year. I have roughly 1500 cases of forecasts by a weather model (a lot of parameters ~ 400) with the respective ""solution"" (the measurements). I turned this into a classification forecast by assigning wind gusts <= 25 knots to class ""0"" and the others to class ""1"" because it has tradition to just report wind gusts above 25 knots in meteorological ground measurements.

My current thoughts are:

- using a very easy algorithm like a perceptron as a comparison

- using some totally different algorithms for skill comparison

-- Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, maybe also some kind of neural network

-- tuning some parameters of these algorithms with cross-validation (or out of bag samples in random forests)

- answering some interesting questions:

-- does the forecast skill get significantly worse when the classification boundary is increased (25 knots -> 30/40 knots) due to less cases?

-- does the forecast skill improve when cases of non-nearby other stations are added? (non-nearby to decrease correlation between the cases)

-- how about combining the forecasts of the tested algorithms? does this yield an even better forecast?

* **Book/e-Book/Videos** - I feel that I learn more hands-on and not too much listening or watching something. However I would like some recommendations about beginner books that could be useful to a better understanding and read before go to sleep. 

* **Datacamp** - They are a platform focused on data science. Are they good? Would I be able to learn everything I need to know there?

I am reading Data science for business from Tom Fawcett. It's really good, with easy language and I feel I am learning a lot but not as much as I would doing things by myself.

That's it. I am more excited with online courses like Udacity but I am not sure.

What would you suggest to me? 
What is the best way to learn data science online? 
What should I learn first?
For someone with my background what would be the best learning plan?

Thank you guys. I appreciate it."

[X-Post][Request] Help us virtually map the accessibility of city streets. Our existing data for Washington D.C. is available via API.,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1501100981,True,"**TL;DR**: We are researchers at the University of Maryland developing new **scalable methods for mapping urban accessibility** by combining crowdsourcing and machine learning. Check out our new tool, [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.io/), that allows users to virtually explore cities and find sidewalk problems, and help us make cities more accessible!

---
Sidewalks benefit all of us. They help improve walkability, increase physical activity, and provide a safe, accessible path for people with disabilities. However, there is a severe lack of information about the location and quality of sidewalks in cities. Our research team at the University of Maryland is trying to change this. **And we need your help**.

[Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.io/) is a new online tool that enables anyone—from motivated citizens to government workers—to virtually walk through cities to locate, label, and assess sidewalk accessibility. Since our beta launch in Fall 2016, over 600 users have contributed **76,000 labels** across 532 miles of DC streets—that’s nearly **50% of the city** (and more than the distance from DC to Detroit).

User-contributed labels are used to develop new accessibility-friendly mapping tools (e.g., route planners, map visualizations), to train machine learning algorithms to semi-automatically assess cities in the future, and to create better transparency about city accessibility (imagine a [WalkScore](http://www.walkscore.com/) for sidewalk accessibility!). And all of our [data](http://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu/api) and [source code](https://github.com/ProjectSidewalk/SidewalkWebpage) is **completely open**, so it's easy for you to build your own applications or perform your own analyses with our data. See: [http://projectsidewalk.io/api](http://projectsidewalk.io/api) for details.

But we are not done. Our goal is **100%** DC coverage and then to expand to five more cities by the end of 2017. To help us get there, we are proud to announce a **new version** of [Project Sidewalk](http://projectsidewalk.io/) that makes it easier and faster to explore DC neighborhoods and find sidewalk problems! Try it out today by visiting [http://projectsidewalk.io](http://projectsidewalk.io/). Even five minutes of your day could help make someone else’s. 

You can also help out by sharing this message with your colleagues, family, and friends and by [retweeting this tweet](https://twitter.com/projsidewalk/status/888040060163162117)!

"Beginning a PhD in the Fall, but interested in data science",8,0,False,False,False,datascience,1501103227,True,"Hello, r/datascience. I've developed an interest in data science but  I need some guidance. I know that you guys see these threads a lot, but I assure you that my situation is somewhat uncommon.

My situation: I have an undergrad Stats background. I was admitted to a PhD program in Biostatistics in a strong school, which I will start this fall. I only recently learned about data science, several months after I accepted my offer of admission. I do not want to leave my program because having a PhD really helps a statistician in biotechnology, and at the moment I'm still very interested in that field.



1) Suppose that I earn my MS and decide that I want to pursue a career in Data Science. Assuming that I have done due diligence by then and honed my Data Science skills (coursera, Kaggle, github and other self-learning), is it better to continue to my PhD if I also enjoy my research, or would it be better to stop and get a DS job? I've read varying opinions (pros and cons) on the worth of a PhD for a data science career, but those answers are usually for somebody who is considering applying to a PhD program, not for somebody who was already admitted. Note that continuing to a PhD would give me time to take CS classes in algorithms and machine learning. 



2) What's the best way to just get a feel for whether I like data science, without sacrificing a lot of time or money? When I ask this, I am not referring to long term self-learning. Rather, I just want a free way to ""explore"" data science without paying a considerable sum for a coursera sequence. If I enjoy data science based on this, I would then proceed to more in-depth self-learning that would involve coursera, github projects, etcetra."

Rules for Crash Course Data Engineering,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1501125223,False,
Some advice for a soon to be PhD?,7,11,False,False,False,datascience,1501132443,True,"Hi r/datascience! So I'm graduating soon with a PhD in physics from a pretty highly ranked school. The thing is, while I heard you would figure out what you wanted to do in grad school, to be honest I still really have no idea what I want to do. Physics research is cool, and I wouldn't kill myself if I had to do it for the rest of my life, but I'm also not *super* into it.

So I've been looking into other options, and one of them is data science. I've done a pretty decent amount of coding in grad school, and maybe even a tiny amount of what could be considered DS. No ML though, and I've been using a somewhat obscure language, so I really would have to teach myself a decent amount before making any moves. However, I think I could do it fairly easily -- I have a strong math background from the phd and a math undergrad, and I can pick up languages fairly quickly, having had to pick up various ones over the years.

I have a couple questions though, if anyone could help me.

1) For people who went into DS from a research background, is it satisfying? I've read stuff about DS work and it seems like it can range from soulless stuff to pretty interesting, important stuff, but I really don't know what the distribution is. For example, I'm not sure how I'd feel about something like figuring out how to increase sales for a company. Are you glad you switched from science research?

2) I like the idea of not being tied down to one specific location, so I'm looking into work I could do remotely on a computer. Do any of you work remotely? Is it common in DS? Or would I really need to spend at least a few years building connections and working in person?

3) I've read a few threads around here about bootcamps and their efficiency/worth and opinion seems somewhat divided. But for my specific background, does anyone have advice? For example, I saw one thread say that phd's might be better off skipping a bootcamp and trying to get hired directly. What has your experience been?

4) Mostly just curiosity, but do any data scientists work part time somehow?

any advice from a similar background would be really helpful, thank you!"
"Freelancers/Consultant, how did you find your first contract?",11,16,False,False,False,datascience,1501145946,True,"I am contemplating the possibility to establish myself as a data science freelance/consultant in the mid-term. With the experience I have, I could help different companies to perform some specific or exploratory data analyses, implement data products (dashboards or other) or, at a higher level, help them designing a global data strategy.

My plan is to work remotely and not on site (there is no local demand where I live and do not consider relocation). On my side this is not an issue as I have been working remotely for a while now but some companies prefer to have the person on site. I am located in Europe and can travel occasionally to meet clients. I assume my main target market would be UK and US.

To take the leap, I would need to have a first decent contract of at least 3 to 6 months. What I have to work on now is to develop strategies/channels to get such contracts. The main ideas I have in mind are:

1. Network. Ask around to some persons I already know if they would be interested in using my services. Main drawback is that I can not do this publicly (e.g. shouting it out on my LinkedIn profile) as I do not want my colleagues to realise that I might leave the company soon.

2. Contact recruiters and let them know that I am available for contract work. I would not rely heavily on this but sometimes this could bring me some opportunities in a passive manner.

3. Offer a bounty. Get some friends/acquaintances/people to know that I offer a cut (e.g. 10%) on any lead on a successful contract. Again, at that moment I can not shout it publicly so it might be a better option in the future. (e.g. once I get my first contract and quite my job).

4. Get in touch with some ""freelancer sales representatives"". I have no idea if such persons exist but I would imagine them as independent consultant/salesman who put in contacts companies with freelancers taking a cut on the process.

5. Freelance platforms. Not a big fan of those as I do not expect high quality clients. Higher quality platforms like Toptal could be an option though but it requires quite some effort to get in.

6. Cold calling/emailing companies. Definitely not something I am interested in as I know by experience from other project that it is time consuming and response rate is very low. This is something I could outsource though.

At the moment I do not know where to start because of all the possible solutions (and I want to have a small portfolio online before starting).
From you experience, which of these channels are more successful? Do you think of any other that could work or has worked for you?

Thanks a lot. :)"

Fresh graduate w/ B.S. in Applied Stats looking to get into Data Science field,13,1,False,False,False,datascience,1501179003,True,"Hello all, 

I appear to be at a pivotal point in my life where my decisions right now could affect my whole career trajectory. I come to you guys looking for some advice and possibly direction.

I recently graduated with a degree in Applied Stats and have pretty good experience in predictive modeling and exploratory analysis both through my classwork and outside of class. 
[Here](https://www.github.com/Njfritter) is my github if anyone would like to look. Also some published projects on a website some of my buddies made:

[Sentiment Analysis](https://www.inertia7.com/projects/28)

[Building a Data Pipeline with Cloudera](https://www.inertia7.com/projects/28)

I have more projects as well utilizing NLP, data mining, and other predictive modeling techniques. I am proficient with Python and R, decent with SQL and have a little Scala/Spark/Java experience.

I want to get into the Data Science field but not quite sure what path to pursue; it is not straight forward like all of my classes have been. My main questions are:

* With my experience as is, would more projects in predictive modeling and EDA be enough to land me a Data Scientist job (most likely Type A due to lack of software engineering knowledge)?
* If I were to get a Data Scientist job, would I be able to make the transition over to using big data tools w/o an advanced degree? Or should I just prepare for the future with an advanced degree?
* Is there anyway I can pursue projects/complete courses at a CC/MOOC to show enough proficiency in CS w/o getting another Bachelor's or advanced degree in CS? 

I have not had much success applying for jobs as a Data Analyst and Data Scientist, and I want to be as efficient as possible in how I go forward spending my time. An advanced degree in say, Computer Science would open many doors; however I would need to gain alot of knowledge in CS just to get to a point where I would be considered for a graduate program.

I apologize if this post is rather long, I just want to make my experience clear. And if any other posts on this subreddit answer my questions feel free to link it as well. Thank you!

[Job Related] Wondering what physical materials I could bring to final interview for a Lead Data Analyst position?,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1501191475,True,"Currently work as a Data Analyst (1.5 years - straight out of school) but am one interview away from a lead role at another company that would truly test/develop my skills and pay a hell of a lot more.

The first in person interview was rough (I thought) and reached the point of a panel of interviewers asking me to go up to the whiteboard and map out an ENTIRE 'master database plan' for a fictitious company including everything from justifying what data I need from the client, how I'll integrate it into our system, what types of databases I'll use in certain situations, ETL processes, data modeling, etc. Then they'd go all Socratic method on me and change one little piece to see how I'd adapt. It was brutal.

They def exposed my weaknesses, but gave me a call back the next morning saying they loved me and wanted to bring me back one last time (with more people there, obviously). Here are my two questions:

1. Usually in final interviews I've brought something physical. A report I made, presentation for a past project, etc. Then I hand out bounded copies and seal the deal. I want to do something similar, but what could I really show? Is there something specific (and tangible) you think I could pass around that would solidify my credibility? 

And 

2. When I first spoke to the recruiter, she asked me what salary I expected. I'll admit I was totally unprepared and hadn't done my research, but it was only a step or so up from where I'm at now, and in the same city. So I felt a little ballsy and asked for the equivalent of a 40% raise. She said that sounded fine and that was it.

However... I checked Glassdoor and the the average pay for that role is literally double what I make now. HOWEVER...I'm assuming most of those associates are people who *actually* met the job description's requirements (5+ years in various realms where I could maybe say I have 6 months). I also met a few of them (same role im applying for) and they're all late-twenties to mid-thirties. I graduated college two years ago, so you can do the math.

So this question has two parts, if I get the offer, is it in bad taste to say ""hey remember that amount I mentioned originally? I'm gunna need more""? And if it's not, then what should I ask for? "

Portfolio simulation project,3,3,False,False,False,datascience,1501197261,True,"Some context:
I am doing this project as a dissertation for my master's in a mortgage bank.

Description:

The bank wants me to do a sensitivity analysis on their portfolio of mortgage accounts.
They already have a simulation (pretty high - level) that simulates their portoflio at the end of each of the next 4 years and outputs capital requirements and their position against their risk appetites.

The inputs of the simulation are their lending plan (how much % of each type of account and how much LTV, redemption rate, probability of default and cure rate to predict Expected losses, HPI, and their desired advances).

What they want from me is to provide them with a framework for testing the portfolio against different economic scenarios and lending plans, playing around with the inputs pretty much.

My approach:
In order to do that, I need to explore the solution space in a systematic way. I am looking into DOE methods to derive solutions at certain levels of each variable.
However,  we have 10 inputs so a full factorial with 3 levels for example is not very feasible (the simulation runs once in 8'').

What are designs I should look for?

Also, the % of LTV must sum up to one, which means that some inputs are dependent on others. How do I deal with that?

Once I have a sample of inputs and their solutions, the plan is to divide it into ""good"" and ""bad"" according to the results (read ""good position against their risk appetites"") and then perform some Smirnov tests to see which values drive good performance, along with correlation analysis between pairs of inputs.

I received many useful comments and a recommendation to try docker....which seems like a solid approach.

Before diving into docker, however, I have perused the possibility of using a scala layer as a possible way to integrate java and r in production using rscala to integrate r and scala (e.g., java web app receives a classification request which is sent through scala to rscala and then  r. In r, ML models are utilized to classify and send a response back to the web app via the scala layer).

I have not yet invested the days it will take to grasp scala (I'm a java programmer not scala) and then rscala. Before embarking on this journey, I am curious whether my proposed framework makes sense.

Or, am I going to hit some major obstacles a few days down the line that will make me regret not just going with docker in the first place?

My background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.

**Architectures**

- Learn how to use Hadoop/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). 

- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.

- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.

**Languages**

- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.

- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.

**Background**

- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.

- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.

- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.

- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.

- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression. You would be amazed how many clients tell me they want to use Deep Learning and have like 500Kb of data."
Opinions about Data Camp,12,11,False,False,False,datascience,1501222786,True,"Hello! I am a junior database developer and I am new to data science and big data. 
I am really interested in those fields and so I took 4 courses on Coursera which were something like an introduction into machine learning, statistics, big data processing and so on. Currently I want to go a step further and learn R or Python. I am curious to find out (from a data scientist point of view) which are the advantages of both R and Python. As far as I've read R is more suitable for the ones who have solid statistics background and Python is much more easier to learn than R but still have powerful data visualization, cleaning and modeling tools. 

Now, my company suggested me to take a specialization from data camp: Data Scientist with Python (https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python). I wanted to ask you if this is worth it and if there are hands-on exercises that helps the student to apply the theoretical knowledge. Also, any other advice regarding starting a career in data science would be really really helpful.

Thanks in advance.

Need some guidance on how to proceed,2,2,False,False,False,datascience,1501245594,True,"Hey! So I am currently working at a large healthcare company doing  analytics and forcasting as an intern(currently in an applied stats masters program) They brought me on and the majority of the team I work with uses primarily excel(so not a ton of analytics) and they want me to develop actionable models to predict patient health and forecast  hiring needs. I basically have unlimited access to all their data(and I mean ALL) it's my first week and I threw together some P.O.C. models and bosses were pretty impressed and want to bring me on full time after graduation (or maybe even before) . So my predicament...

Positives: I am doing data science in a sense and since they didn't have any predictive analytics prior, anything I do going to generate business lift. I also have the unique opportunity to basically building an analytics pipeline form scratch which I think will be a good experience.

Negatives: My issue is as somebody who is just starting out in the field I'm worried that bieng the most analytically enabled person on my team(but also probably the lowest pay grade) doesn't seem like a good idea because most of my learning would be self taught

"am I doing something wrong here? (xgboost, gridsearchcv)",4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1501266933,True,"hi, r/datascience! 

I'll get right to the chase: 

I have a sinking feeling that I'm doing some shoddy data science work, and I was hoping y'all might be able to either a) confirm that what I'm doing is wrong, or b) tell me I'm actually fine. 

I'll try my best to describe the situation -- and my approach -- as clearly as possible, but I recognize this might need some clarification. 

for a bird's eye view: I'm using xgboost and gridsearchcv to identify the best hyperparameters for my model. 

here are the steps I'm performing, in order (step that I think might be inappropriate is bolded): 

* split my dataset into training and testing (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test) 

* pass a variety of hyperparameters and the X_train dataset to GridSearchCV (with cv = 10) 

* identify best estimator determined through GridSearchCV (best_xgbooster) 

* **split my original dataset in train and testing datasets N times, and for each split (X_train_2, X_test_2, etc.) , fit best_xgbooster to the training data and gather the score from the testing sets** 

I feel like this last step might be wrong because inevitably some of X_train (the original) will end up in an X_test_2 dataset, meaning the model I'm generating has 'already seen' the data it's being tested on.  

assuming my concerns are valid, my question is this: 

if we cut out the last step (where the original dataset is split again N times) and simply rely on seeing the results of best_xgbooster on the original X_test and y_test, I'll only have a single value to show at the end of this entire process. 

I'm concerned that this single value might very well be some random fluctuation, and that it will not be representative of the actual robustness of my model. 

is it appropriate to instead perform the *entire* GridSearchCV process over again from the beginning? i.e. split the original dataset into a new X_train, y_train, pass the *same* hyperparameters to GridSearchCV, and use the 'best' model determined via GridSearch to calculate a single value for the new X_test, y_test values? I feel like this will take inordinate amounts of time (given the number of hyperparameters passed, and the overall time it takes for a single xgboosted model to get built), but if that's the case, so be it! 

I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on this, and -- assuming I'm wrong -- some help understanding where I'm going wrong and why. 

thanks!"

Question about the intuition and also best black box Python solutions for neural networks?,4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1501397311,True,"I'm a Data Analytics Intern, and one of my projects I'm presenting at the end of summer intern event is a logistic regression classifier. My project presentation is in a few days, and my boss said that I could probably improve classification accuracy if I used neural networks.

My general understanding of neural networks are that you can add and combine multiple hidden layers to create sort of mini classifiers, so that when you put all the layers together you have one really complex classifier. Backpropagation (something I don't yet fully understand) is the algorithm that helps train the neural network and reduce the cost function. Activation functions don't have to always be sigmoids, there can be a variety of different activation functions. Is this the general idea? 

Also, since I don't yet have a complete mathematical understanding of neural networks, I'm looking to just use a blackbox Python/R Studio package to have something to present to my boss (hopefully with a better accuracy than that of my regression classifier). Any suggestions to achieve this goal?

Has anyone worked with using Hadoop to put AWS common crawl data into an elastic search database? I'm trying to get a rough idea of how hard/expensive this idea would be...,10,2,False,False,False,datascience,1501433688,True,"I want to store common crawl data into an elastic search database. 

This link in the AWS documents looks like it will be my guide:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/indexing-common-crawl-metadata-on-amazon-emr-using-cascading-and-elasticsearch/

The only difference being that instead of storing metadata, I want to store text from the sites. 

This is sort of an experiment and since I know that the common crawl has TONS of data, I'm concerned that I'm overlooking the compute and storage costs as well as the complexity of the problem. 

Anyone have any idea approximately how long this would take and how much it would cost in storage?

I honestly couldn't even guess. Will it take hadoop an hour? 10 hours? 10 days?

Also, I know a lot of effort was put into compressing common crawl data so if I put it into an elastic search database, how much (if any) will the data balloon?

Like if I just try to index that last posted archive of say 50 gb, will that turn into something ridiculous like 3 tb in elastic search?

Overfitting with 130:1 input to variable ratio,29,4,False,False,False,datascience,1501507104,True,"Hi, I'm managing a group of interns this summer and I know just enough about data science to be dangerous, I could use some help on intuitions around overfitting.

We've 1300 data points for property ""success"" that we're trying to model with a mix of variables and random forest methodology. When we use 90% of the data to train and 10% to validate the model, the best we can do is an Rsquare of .7 with 30 variables, but if I use the whole data set in building the model I can get an RSquare of .97 using only 10 variables. 

My intuition as an amateur is that it's difficult to overfit a model this size when there is only 10 input variables, but there might be something about the random forest methodology that has a tendency to overfitt more than methodology I'm familiar with. 

Our desired output is to have a bellwether for where we should invest future development efforts--we don't need an exact answer.

What would the concerns and risks be with choosing to use the 10 variable model over the 30? Would it be reasonable to average the outputs between the two?"

Using coefficient of variation to study distribution of comment vote counts of a submission on reddit.,3,2,False,False,False,datascience,1501523813,True,"I'm trying to study the distribution of comment ""points"" (upvotes-downvotes) on posts of various subreddits, and how the distribution varies with the subreddit of choice. For example, a ""funny"" or non serious subreddit should have high variation - the comment with highest number of votes will vary to a great extent from the mean, than a ""serious"" subreddit, where the distribution will be more uniform (less variation from the mean).

I thought of using the coefficient of variation as a metric to explain this behaviour, and the results seem to make sense, the posts on ""serious"" subreddits have lower CV than those on ""non serious"" subreddits. But, it seems that CV should not be used as a metric for data which are not from ""ratio scale"", and since comment points can have negative values, they do not come from a ratio scale.

Is there a way to get around this problem? Somehow transform the data (comment vote counts) to a ratio scale? Or use some other metric of variation to continue this analysis, which is also consistent theoretically? Does the fact that the mean of most of these distributions is not close to zero (is a high positive value) help the case of using CV?"

Reflecting on a previous interview question. Need advice.,5,2,False,False,False,datascience,1501604812,True,"In a preview interview, I had a case study where I had to classify whether someone will get a disease or not. The probability of getting the disease is 1%.

I mentioned I will use a logistic regression, and I would use many variables such as demographics info, medical history, lifestyle factors, etc. I mentioned it doesn't hurt to start with many variables since we can do variable selection later.

I was asked how many data sample I would need. I said it depends on the cost of data acquisition and the acceptable variance of the model. But later I realized there is a ""rule of 10"" rule of thumb for logistic regression where the number of samples should be (number of predictors) * 10 / (the probability of the rare case).

Anyway, the follow up question is that because the data samples are taken from those that can to the hospital for a checkup, can the results be applied toward the general population? I said no because people that go for check ups tend to be health conscious and therefore would not be an accurate representation of the general population.

But I was asked how to compensate for this and I drew a blank. And how would you quantify the ""difference"" between those that came for checkups and the general population?

Can you advise on anything I answered poorly or wrong so I can improve?

I answered as long as our model contains all the variables that may be different across the two groups, and if those who came for checkups have a wide scatter of values for those predictors (even if the mean might be different than the general population), then the logistic model would still be valid for the general population.

Using the Same Inputs to Predict Different Outputs (x-post r/Analyst),5,2,False,False,False,datascience,1501641698,True,"Hi all,

I have a question about the data set I'm working with that I hope you can help me answer.  I have a data set that (for reasons I won't get into) has largely the same input variables for different output variables.  The data is broken up by country, and each country has all the same inputs with varying outputs.   Here's an example of what I mean:

Target | Country | Variable 1 | Variable 2 | Variable 3 | Variable 4 | Variable 5
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
.044 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.022 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.032 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.096 | USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.412| USA | .4 | 5 | 1823 | .3 | -.4
.112 | UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.102 |  UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.098 |  UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.133 |  UK | .3 | 4.47 | 1900 | .22 | -.2
.099 | Mexico | .3 | 4.35 | 1903 | .15 | -0.5
.111 | Mexico | .3 | 4.35 | 1903 | .15 | -0.5
.143 | Mexico | .3 | 4.35 | 1903 | .15 | -0.5


Hopefully this is enough so you can understand what I mean.  The input variables are the same for each country, and the target varies slightly.

Something about using the data like this for a regression feels *wrong*.  Should I average the target variable for each country even if it greatly reduces the overall number of records that I have?

Edit:  I also want to point out - my target variable came from actual proprietary data, while almost all the other data came from was pulled in from other sources and repeated in order to match the country variable (I pulled it from BP, World Bank, etc. and matched it with the country I had for each record in the proprietary data). Does that many any difference?

To be clear, the above data is completely fictitious.

Thanks!"

I'm a programmer/sysadmin looking to get into data science. Where do I start?,14,3,False,False,False,datascience,1501709946,True,"Hi, everybody. I guess I'm looking to get into data science. I was trained as a programmer, and in the course of my career I've also been a sysadmin, DB admin, network guy, hardware tester, and so on and so forth. I'm pretty good at all of it. But every now and then I'm given a big, messy, ugly dataset and told to extract something useful from it, and I'm *really good* at that.

Just for example, a while back I was working for the documentation department of a major hardware manufacturer, and we were asked to take all the documentation the company had ever produced and put it all online for the first time. This was three decades worth of PDFs covering thousands of products in thirty-odd different languages. All of them had been scanned at some point, and given XML metadata, but the metadata had been hand-edited and was often incomplete, erroneous, or specified the wrong encoding and displayed as gibberish.

My team lead--a better programmer than I was--looked over it for a while and decided it was too inconsistent to automate; the whole team would have to pitch in to check  every document manually, at a cost of some 200 person-hours all told. I asked for a few hours to try to pick out just the entries that were 100% complete and compliant, to save us a bit of time. In the process of writing that script, I noticed that many of the errors repeated consistently, and with a few reliable markers I could deduce what they were supposed to be; e.g. if the metadata specified, say, Chinese Simplified (GB2312) encoding and produced gibberish, usually it was supposed to be Chinese Simplified (GB18030), and it was easy enough to see if the text in the XML file looked like GB18030 encoding.

I put in three 12-hour days, iterating and examining the results and iterating again, finding and nailing down patterns, and by the end of it I had a script that correctly classified 98% of our documents.

This kind of work is enthralling to me, and I seem to be good at it despite zero formal training. I literally do this for fun--spreadsheeting data and analyzing from games is as much fun to me as playing. I'd love to find steady work like this. But just saying that doesn't impress interviewers, and I really don't even know what kind of jobs I should be looking for. I've been calling it ""data analysis"", but I've also seen ""data science"" and ""data engineering"", among others.

So I guess my questions are: How do I find work like this? What should I do to market myself? Are there courses I could take to teach me standards, methods, and tools that I'm not aware of, and/or certifications I could get that would look good? Are there any other forums where I should ask this?

General practice to impute missing values,9,4,False,False,False,datascience,1501753275,True,"I had some doubts related to imputation of data and wanted to discuss them here.

Let's say there is a dataset which is split into train and validation set. Should imputation take place before splitting the dataset or after splitting on training dataset? If on training dataset, how should validation split be imputed?

Follow up question. Let's say we are using KNN to impute the dataset. If I build an application that takes in a datapoint, I would need to impute the missing values for that datapoint before running predictions on it. Since KNN looks for closest rows, I feel I should add this datapoint to my imputed dataset on which prediction model was developed, run KNN again on it, get imputed datapoint and then run predictions on it. Is this correct way to do it? Would this process change for other imputation methods, like BPCA?"

My 7 Year Data Analytics Career Journey,23,59,False,False,False,datascience,1501810158,True,"This week is my seven year anniversary of starting to work full-time after college.  I've had quite the meandering road to work full-time in Analytics, so I thought this would be a good chance to detail the road I've taken.  It seems many posts here ask how people got into Analytics - I hope this helps.  I'm not yet a Data Scientist, but I'm on that road and I think this subreddit best fits this post.  Feel free to ask questions if you'd like any clarifications.

**This will be long!  But I want to give all relevant details to my path as I think it's an example of what an organic road into analytics looks like.**

**Education**: I graduated from a large state university with dual degrees in Economics (BS) and International Studies (BA).  I wasn't planning on working in analytics; I thought I was going to work internationally and spent time getting fluent in Spanish while in college.  Those plans changed!

**First job - August 2010**

* Customer Support Rep for a small tech startup

I had no idea what Data Analysis was at the time, but I started naturally doing it.  There would be a change to our website and I would receive upwards of 2,000 emails about the change. I would go through the tickets and create an analysis - with suggestions for the product team - based on the feedback our customers gave.  This quickly got passed up the chain and became a regular analysis I did for the executive and product teams when a major site change happened.

This was my first foray into analytics - I had no idea what it was, but I liked the process of aggregating, interpreting and presenting data in a way that helped others make informed business decisions.

**Second Job - Promotion - July 2011**

* Promotion to Account Manager for the same small tech startup

I was promoted up the chain in sales, but still wanted to do analytics.  I took over the administration of Salesforce and started making various reports without being asked - sales forecast reports, pipeline reports, backward-looking sales reports.  Anything I could think of - and I became trusted to make those across the company.

**Third Job - Acquisition by large company - April 2013**

* Client Manager for large East Coast software company

The startup I was working for ran out of money.  We were acquired by an east coast software company who didn't guarantee any of our jobs.  Even though I was seeking to be an analyst, I wouldn't keep my job if I played that angle. So I interviewed for and stayed with a Client Manager role in sales.  I also had all analytics stripped from me - they didn't need me for that role.

Well, I still found a way around this.  I learned that the Client Management superiors had no reporting on what I and others were working on.  No analytics around our sales, our renewals or what we were on track to do for each quarter.  Bingo!  I had a new analytics job.

I created a dashboard for the management on my team to track our sales and renewals by rep and by team. They loved it, and I got to keep analytics going at least part time at my new job.

However, an underlying issue remained - I wasn't anything more than maybe 20-25% analytics.  I was getting pigeonholed into a Sales career and I didn't want that to happen.  It was time to make a move, but I had no idea what to do. 

I started talking to others in analytics, asking how they got their jobs.  All paths were unique - but all involved somehow convincing a company to take a shot on them as a low level analyst, even part time.  So I started job hunting for positions like that.

**Interview that changed the trajectory of my career - May 2014**

I had a contact at a growing manufacturing company that had no analytics.  My contact told me I could interview for a lower-level position that I could easily do, while taking on analytics tasks that were needed around the company as a test. I was told the position was a contract one and it was up to me to turn it into a salary position during the interview.

So, I had the interview with the CFO and the VP of Sales.  In the interview, I saw them shift from talking about a general contract position into seeing me as someone they could take a risk on as an analyst.  They had no one dedicated to this and I had enough passion (and a small track record) that they were sold.  I was to be hired on as an analyst 50% of the time until I proved myself capable of doing that 100% of the time.  I took a pay cut, a cut in benefits and signed on.

**Fourth Job - May 2014**

* Analyst 50% of time; other work 50% of time

I knew that I'd be in over my head but *wow* - that was an understatement.  I ended up in the equivalent of an ocean-sized whirlpool.  The company was growing at a 100-120% rate per year.  Employment was doubling every year. And there was no one doing analytics.  On top of that- my analysis had to be *perfect* - a mistake of 1% meant the company over or underordered by USD $1M.  And man, was I not perfect.

I had to learn how to build a database for the CFO, manage metadata, create financial reporting.  I had to make royalty reporting outputs.  I needed to create ordering reports for the sales team, a catalog the sales team could reference at any time of day to see what was in stock.  So much more.  I had to do everything all at once, with little experience.

I was close to being fired at one point.  Not due to lack of passion, but because the margin for error was so low, and I was going to make errors as I learned how to be an analyst.

But I got over that hump, kept my job, and kept learning.  And convinced them to turn me into a full-time analyst.

**Fifth Job - August 2015**

*  Promotion to Data Analyst (100% of time job!)

I call my previous position and this one my Data Masters Degree. I was underpaid. I learned everything from database creation to executive dashboards in Tableau.  I learned SQL from scratch. I learned how to gather requirements from executives and turn them into actionable reports/analyses.  It was incredibly stressful but rewarding. I became trusted around the company and became an analyst supporting nearly 250 people across all departments.  My reports and dashboards were visible all over screens and computer monitors throughout the office - as an analyst, there's nothing cooler than seeing your stuff helping people do their job.

But, all good things come to an end.  Eventually I was told that the company didn't need me as an analyst anymore; they needed to build out a data warehouse and it was non-negotiable that I'd head up that project.  I feared getting pigeonholed as a DBA and started looking for a new analyst job in the area to keep me on track.

**Sixth Job - July 2016**

* Web Analyst

I found a new job as a Web Analyst.  It was for a consultancy  It wasn't perfect, but I was finally being paid market rate for my skills.  I got to learn how web analytics worked.  And more importantly, I was no longer turning into a DBA.

I'm still at this job and am responsible for web analytics at a major international brand.  I have many client stakeholders who live far away from me, but I still manage to create KPIs, manage analytics, create readouts and more. However, much of the job is very basic in analytics when compared to my previous position.

Unfortunately, the company I started working for was bought out as I joined.  This time by a new East Coast company that has bungled the purchase.  Of the 20 analysts at my office to start the year, only 10 remain.  It's a mess-  we are doing boring work that isn't challenging, with no prospects of improvement. I will stagnate here, and that is not good in the analytics world.

So, I have started a new job hunt and feel I'm at the verge of moving into another analytics role at a fast moving company --

**Seventh Job - Search & Offer - August 2017**

I've been searching for a new job.  I put down some pretty specific requirements that I wasn't sure would be easily findable.  I wanted a small to medium company (I find doing analytics at a large company puts me in a smaller role than I want).  It needed to be growing - working for a shrinking company is terrible. It needed to value problem solving (a skill I think I have and I love using). It needed to value technical ability for analysts. It needed to not want to kill its analysts by working them 60+ hours a week.

I think I've found that role- it fits all those checkboxes.  I've done an in-person interview and received an offer this week which I’m very excited about.  I'll again start growing in my technical abilities and make a different at a growing company with an underdeveloped analytics arm.  I'm excited to be looking forward to going into work again.

------------------------

So, that's my story of my first seven years working.  Analytics is an exciting world.  I want to continue to learn Statistics to start working on forward-looking analytics that you see from actual Data Scientists.  I may end up in management someday.  What I know is that I need to keep growing and a path forward will present itself.  Life has a funny way of not going to plan, so I just set up a structure and move within that.

I'm happy to answer any questions.  I know this was long, but I hope it helps give a sense of what an organic path into a career in analytics looks like. "
Apologies for the buzzword: advice for creating a paradigm shift in a team's analytics approach?,4,3,False,False,False,datascience,1501811681,True,"Long story short, I have just been appointed the data science/analytics lead for my team. My team consists entirely of classic .NET and BI **developers** - not analysts or data scientists. These colleagues of mine are tasked each week with completing a variety of analytics projects, from basic report development to predictive modeling/ML.

Remember that these guys are traditionally developers. I'm not saying that developers cannot or have never successfully done analytics, but that is not the case on my team. DS/ML tools are just not on their tool belts at this stage of the game.

Examples of some errors I've had to correct in the last couple of weeks: someone used a unique identifier (an index, basically, which *could* contain predictive info, but didn't in this case) to predict whether a generic customer was going to buy another product; the same person also used the amount the person spent on their second purchase to predict the likelihood someone would buy a product **for the second time**. Lots of ""hand in the cookie jar"" modeling happening.

They also seem to be easily distracted by shiny new tools like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and XGBoost, focusing on testing *n* different models instead of worrying about the data actually going into the model.

**My question for you guys: how would you go about effecting change in the ways in which some of my colleagues perform analytics?**

My gut, as a statistician, is to have them go through rigorous statistical training, since this is really the biggest skills gap they possess. That's not really feasible, given departmental budgets and the amount of work coming down our pipe. I feel like some of my colleagues are being asked to drive Ferraris (and who wouldn't want to drive a Ferrari?), when they've really just gotten their learner's permits."

I've had the fortune of having some good opportunities recently, most notably a job last summer and research this summer that involved using deep learning/neural networks for image processing tasks. When I was thrown into the deep end with neural networks last summer, it was definitely overwhelming but I got to ride on the back of a more experienced PhD student and ultimately learned a lot. Same case this summer: confused about many parts of the project, but benefitting from a lot of help from another PhD student.

Now however I have a lot of random knowledge about neural networks but still have big gaps in knowledge and have only completed one project independently, which was essentially just an NBA in-game win probability model using out of the box logistic regression. I am working as an actuarial intern right now, but that work is all in excel and not what I would qualify as ""data science.""

Do you guys think it would be possible to leverage these experiences to get an internship for next summer? Will it help that I am taking courses in Big Data & Analytics and Database Systems this year? If I can get a job, what companies hire undergrads for these kinds of jobs, if any do at all? Thanks!

Aspiring Data Scientist/Quant needing advice!,28,5,False,False,False,datascience,1501984857,True,"I'm an aspiring data scientist/quantitative investor. I need some advice for my current situation. I'm currently working in Wealth Management as an investment advisor, but I've begun to stagnate in my position/career. I believe it's time to make a move as I'm only getting older and the company I'm working for does not have a bright future or at least a future where a lot of growth is expected. I also don't want to be in an advisor role in the future, but would rather be purely on the buy-side of investing or doing quantitative research as an actual data scientist. 

I have a semi-technical background. I got my B.S. in Economics, but took Calc I, II, III. I also got my MBA with an emphasis in Finance where I took applied econometrics through the masters of economics program and an investment research class that used SAS. Academically I received all A's (3.97/4 for both degrees), but it is was at a state school in Reno, NV. For the last 3 years I've been learning Python, SQL, and various other computer science topics, and I've been able to build some projects that have automated tasks in my current position, and I'm also building out my personal website using the Django framework to showcase my technical abilities.

My goal/desire is to get into a more quantitative role for a firm trying to grow where I can leverage my finance/economics and programming background. Unfortunately my network is not great as my current role is with a tiny firm that hasn't provided me much networking in the finance or analyst world, albeit I am to blame for not networking harder. My current position isn't something to say ""wow"" at on a resume either, but I've been able to learn and accomplish a lot of tasks. But now I'm trying to make a move into a career that will be more fulfilling and not a complete switch from my professional experience. 

I was recently accepted into the Galvanize Data Science immersive program. I won't be attending until early 2018, so I can save money to avoid any debt. I also want to improve my stats and programming before entering the program to give myself the best chance for success. I'm currently hung up on the risk of the program though. It's $16,000 and I'll have to quit my job which pays around $85,000, so the true cost is much higher especially if I'm looking for a job for the average 3 months they state. I'm also concerned that my background isn't the best for landing a job quickly out of the program. I'll be looking for either a pure data scientist role or hopefully an investment analyst or trading position with a hedge fund. I do believe this program will be the quickest way to switch into a more fulfilling position with greater future career prospects though. I'd like advice from those in the field or who hire data scientist as to whether me joining this program is a good idea. Do you think I should take the risk and join the immersive program to get into a more fulfilling career?

I know sports science seems a bit of a joke course but my maths background is strong A's and many national awards in maths, physics, accounts throughout all my school life...bit of a maths genius back in the day.

As I've graduated and looking for a career I want to get back into maths and initially looked at doing masters in statistics, but after more research read about data science and this seems to have a great employment situation in terms of Available work and salary.

However, I am open to any are of work and enjoy statistics. Perhaps careers are not so well paying or easily found on pure statistics? I've not overly researched as you can see.

Would I best go for a career in dat science or there are many more options out there? Of course it's up to me to see what is there and what I think I'd enjoy. I've just been overwhelmed by the data science jobs it seems a great option.

I've been getting a lot of advice on how to break into the industry from my current position, and the most common bit of advice is to create some of my own projects. So I have an idea and I wanted to see if there are any practicing data scientists who would like to mentor me through the project. I'll try to explain my idea below. 

**Study:**
I'm a huge baseball fan and have been analyzing sabermetrics for a while now. I want to research pitchers and why some seem to constantly outperform or underperform their advanced metrics of FIP, xFIP, and Sierra. Michael Pineda for the Yankees is one of the examples that sparked my interest. He has great stuff doesn't walk many batters per 9, but his ERA was a full point above what the advanced metrics said he should be at in 2015 & 2016. This could all be due to bad luck, but I have another theory. Not all strikes are equal. Most agree that walking batters is a bad trait for a pitcher, but throwing fastballs right down the middle to avoid walks may be worse. I want to analyze the quality of strikes a pitcher throws. Good quality strikes would be those closer to the edge of the strike zone. baseballsavant.com provides me with the downloadable data. My hypothesis is that pitchers who not only throw more strikes but throw strikes that are on the edge of the strike zone will consistently outperform other pitchers even when accounting for velocity and movement. 

**Project Outline:**
My study outline will be as follows:
1. download and store the data for each player from 2010-2017. (PostgresSQL)
2. Clean the data and create a quality pitch metric. I think average distance from the corner of the strike zone will be an appropriate statistic. (Python)
3. Run regression models to predict ERA. (Python or R)
4. Complete a write-up and attach to my personal website. (Django)

I will use 2010-2015 as the learning data and then 2016-2017 as test data. 

Another idea is to use a leave one out validation technique to predict game by game based on the pitchers season so far. This will probably be computationally intensive, so I may have to leverage other technologies to accomplish it. 

**Potential Model:**
Expected ERA = B0 + B1QualityofStrike + B2BB% + B3K% + B4Velocity + B5Movement

I would love to get some input if there are ways to use deep learning to create a more accurate prediction or to help highlight players that may have made an improvement in their quality of strikes and therefore may outperform their historical performance. Or any advice on modeling techniques that will provide a better prediction. 

Anyone interested in mentoring me?

Forecasting potential revenue(opportunity of customers) question. Probability the best way?,7,6,False,False,False,datascience,1502062101,True,"We sell alot of subscription products.  So the customer either buys it or they dont.  For big customers, calculating potential opportunity is simple.

If we have 20 products, they could potentially buy all 20 a single time.  So, its just summing the prices of those products.

However, for a tiny customer....they COULD buy all 20 products hypoethically. But, its completely unrealistic.

So, how do i give them a potential revenue number?

My thoughts on this is that it has to be probability based.  For example, either predict a classifier on whether they will by a product . if they will sum the products price.  

or maybe, downsize the potential opportunity by multiplying it by how likely they are to buy that product.  If its a 10k product, that they are 30% likely to buy, multiply it by 30%.

thoughts on this approach/other approaches?"

Introducing aptos: A Python module for validating JSON data and converting JSON Schema documents into various data-interchange formats,0,11,False,False,False,datascience,1502222500,True,"[https://github.com/pennsignals/aptos](https://github.com/pennsignals/aptos)

> Why did I write aptos?

I am currently a Data Engineer on the Predictive Healthcare Team at Penn Medicine. Our team of Data Scientists builds and train models on data received from the electronic medical record (EMR). Working with clinical data often requires tedious validation and type assertion checking. Therefore, a lot of time is spent cleaning the data instead of training models with it.

aptos uses JSON Schema, a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents. aptos allows developers to validate client-submitted data at the source.

While there exist other JSON Schema Python modules, aptos is different because it also supports converting JSON Schema documents into various data-interchange formats.

Currently, aptos supports converting JSON Schema documents into Avro Schema documents, a popular serialization format for reading/writing data from HDFS.

Left academia and looking for options as an aspiring data scientist with an NLP/ML background. Any advice/things to know before I start searching for jobs (and is remote a possibility?),6,0,False,False,False,datascience,1502228673,True," Hey /r/datascience, I was hoping I could get some help as to how I could approach data science with my background.

Before I left a PhD program in Information Science and Technology this spring (I seriously recommend taking a gap year) I took an information visualization class and really loved it. I have experience working with data from past internships (language technologist working with large corpora on an active learning task) as well as my own studies in my undergrad and master's programs in linguists. Even though my background is primarily in applied linguistics I'm a decent Python programmer, have worked usingg scikit learn and NLTK a ton, and find myself happiest working with large sets of messy language data. 

With academia I had a set idea of jobs I'd be pursuing 5 years from now but with my recent departure I'm finding myself sort of in the middle of data science, NLP, and machine learning. I'm currently working on projects to beef up my portfolio to show I have a software development background and am a competent programmer (my github is lacking atm) but I'm really more interested in data science. I also have experience with R and Illustrator, and can code in Java, Perl, and bash. 

My question is are there any skills I should try to develop before applying to data science jobs that will either help me in the field or mesh nicely with my background in natural language processing. Like I said earlier I really like language data and prior employers said having a linguist on hand was useful. I have gotten a few rejections from companies regarding data science positions but that has mainly been from lack of experience specifically in working with hardware and machine learning. 

Also, I was curious to hear from those in the field who work remotely or partially remotely. One of the main reasons I left my PhD was because I have a chronic illness that got so out of hand I was physically unable to work and almost went on disability. Luckily I found a great surgeon who has since helped me tremendously, but it's so important for me to stay close to him since my condition has no cure and I know I'll regularly need specialized surgery to keep it under control. I prefer working from home because it gives me the chance to be in pain, puke, and just generally feel shitty and try to make myself comfortable not around other people, something I've struggled with in past workplace environments and academia. I know this might not be the place to disclose all this but I want to paint a clear picture of why remote work is not just something I want to do but really have to to be a productive employee, and I'm hoping this field may be open to it. 

Anyways, thanks for any future advice and guidance!"

Am I jaded against data science careers?,18,0,False,False,False,datascience,1502287977,True,"Hello!

 I originally posted this to career advice, but I figured I might get more answers here. 
 I'll start this post by giving a brief background of my experience and education. My degree is in Statistics, but I have not been working in the profession for the past couple of years. 
 Currently, I am working for a Software as a Service (SaaS) company for almost two years doing work where I create programs that import data into a database and export it out to vendors in JavaScript and XML. I love what I do, but I really want to do more programming work where I'm actually creating and building things than just import and export programs. I did it for five years three jobs previous to the one I'm doing now for another SaaS company until I was laid off. 
 In between that time, I tried going down the data analytics route, and I found that I was bored out of my mind just cranking out reports in SQL and Business Objects all day long. I'm the type of person that likes variety in their job, and I became so bored doing these jobs that I started teaching myself JavaScript while I was at work and I loved it. After feeling that I was being severely underutilized in my previous job to the one I have now, I made the decision that the field just isn't for me. 
 In my current company, I have been trying to move over to the programming team where I feel like I can finally make steps to getting where I want to in my career. I had already been shot down once since I was supposedly too valuable where I was at. 
 Yesterday, I had a conversation with the VP of that department, and after telling him my background, experience, that I like what I do but I want to do more, and I have been building a project for the past six months to prove I have what it takes to make it in that department; he tried to convince me that I should just go into data analytics. His reasoning was that for every person with my skill set, he could find 100 developers. His other reasons were that the money was there and I could be creative in that field, etc. 
 At this point, it was really discouraging for me that despite the passion that I have for programming and having spent my free time learning Java and building something, that he would try to convince me to do something that I really have no desire of doing anymore. I really could care less about the money since I would rather be in a field that I happy in than making money in a field that I am not. 
 My reasoning back to him was that I found myself bored in the profession and that to get anywhere within it that field, I would need a master's, which I have no plans of wasting my time or energy on. I also said, however, that maybe I have a bias since my other two forays into the data analytics field I wasn't allowed to do any actual analysis since I lacked a master's. He said that not having a master's shouldn't be a barrier, but my experience and a quick Indeed job search say otherwise. 
 So I'm just wondering if maybe I am a bit biased as far as data analytics and maybe the field might be a better fit for me than I currently think. Maybe I had just a bad couple of fits and it made me jaded from the field. I just want a balanced perspective so I know I'm making the right decision for myself in the long run.
 Another perspective that I am looking for is maybe I should start looking for a new job since I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle at this company to get where I want to go. The company I currently work for is a very swim lanes oriented type of company, so I'm thinking that I'm going to be stuck where I'm at with no movement. 
 Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!!"

With that in mind, does anyone have any suggestions on conferences that they've attended that have a good mix of ML/analytics folks that isn't super-specific to one industry?

Im in second year CS and recently a Research Assistant for Data Mining and Analysis position just opened up at my university. Im really interested in going into Data Science and Analytics in the future and this seems like a very good opportunity. I need some advice tho to apply for this position. 
___________________

*The Job Details:*

This assistantship is ideal for an undergraduate student with some experience in computer programming, and who wishes to develop skills in data analysis or in interdisciplinary settings.

Tasks:
•Developing scripts in python, javascript or other relevant languages for data mining
•Manipulating SQL databases
•Researching and experimenting to find the best existing tools to facilitate data extraction or analysis
•Installing and maintaining server-side (on Ubuntu server) applications related to the research project

Required: 
- Knowledge and experience in computer programming in one or more of these languages: javascript, php, python, R.
- Good academic grades
- Capacity to work autonomously and collaborate in a team
- Basic knowledge of and interest for open source technologies and Linux systems 

________________

Now my academic grades are not that great, and for that Im doubting they will give me this position. But what Im willing to do is show them a sample project to show I have experience or knowledge of this and also to show that I am interested. Im also able to get a letter from my dorm coordinator to say ""I was homesick and didnt do well academically but Im fine now"".  

My skills are:
-HTML, CSS and JavaScript + p5.js library experience, havent used JavaScript for much heavy stuff, only made simple web apps like PigLatin translator, tip calculator and a flappy bird game but extremely simple(without all the cool graphics and menu screens, just involved a little ball flying avoiding obstacles. )

-Java. Did some android studio stuff, all my labs were the prof just throwing stuff at us, and quite a lot of people lost marks in this. I know how to develop a model class using a given API, a vague understanding of the MVC, and some understanding of arrays, hash lists, lambda expressions, inheritance, threading, interface, enums, static variables etc. A lot of this stuff I taught myself over the summer through online courses and haven't actually done anything heavy with it other than practicing alongside the instructor or making a JavaFX currency converter app. 

-PHP: very very basic, I haven't been taught this at university, I basically know the types of loops, assigning variables and some more basic stuff like echo. I do have used a guide to help me make a Login system on a web app with a user registration option and a MySQL database on the backend. 

-Python: also self taught, through a guide, did a little Loan Analysis through a step by step guide. I know how to import libraries, assign variables, loops, and then use matplotlib pandas and numpy to show data in different formats and munge missing data(this part i didnt really understand the point of but I just followed the guide). 

-SQL: I know how to create tables in databases. Pretty sure this is very basic. I also know a little scripting that can help extract data, manipulate it etc. 

-Im not sure what open source technologies are at all, i do know what open source means. I do not know what they mean by Linux systems interest. I do know how to use one and have worked on my programming labs fully in Linux(centOS). 

Now what I plan is, write a full report (almost like a ripoff of the guide I used but less brief and showing what I understood and how I implemented it) and providing it as a supporting document. I also plan on doing on of the ""yelp Data Analysis contest"" things and writing a report in it too. The job starts in a month and a half, so by then I plan to focus and learn more about python and data analysis. 

I also want to show deep interest in Data Mining and Analysis, but im not a very good writer or expresser so ill need help on that. 

Any help will be appreciated, and more questions may arise so ill keep editing this post. 

Thanks :D

What to look for in a data analyst position?,12,1,False,False,False,datascience,1502315955,True,"I recently graduated with my masters in business analytics from a lesser known state school.   I currently am a summer intern with a management consulting firm (which runs out after this month and they're not looking to hire a full-time analyst at the moment), but my primary interest is in working with data.  I'm self-taught in R (mostly using MOOCs for the last two years). I'm smooth with data wrangling and visualizations, but I am still very rough in machine learning. I don't think there's any way I can realistically compete with people with true stats backgrounds for data science jobs, any time in the near future. I can do stuff like building business-level decision models or I'm even testing out building my first web app in Shiny, but I'm just not all that proficient with building machine learning models.

I still would like to work in some sort of field where I can code, even if I can't be a DS. The problem is that all data analyst jobs I see are either ""PhD in stats required"" or ""we'll take anybody with basic Excel skills"" (most of which pay about the same as what I make as an intern, which isn't exactly the best sell). There really doesn't seem to be anything interesting in between those extremes. I feel like my only realistic options at this point are to go back for a second masters in stats to catch up to everybody else or to just switch industries entirely to something like finance.

I have read the readmes and think that this is a valid question and the right place, but am happy to be corrected :-)

I include a brief description, with questions at the end:

A colleague is looking at the ways in which data science is being used to best effect (or not) within the UK government. Some brief googling and examination of journals and blogs has shown that there does not seem to be any systematic list or analysis of the public sector's use of data and data science - I think there should be.

My initial search through blogs turned up the fabulous example of the [rogue train on the circle line in Singapore](https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a ""Singapore Train""), but I feel the slapdash approach lacks discipline and will lead to missing out.

Using a helpful Python library called BeautifulSoup, containing the IANA list of top level domain names, I wrote a [script](https://github.com/ababyyou/webscrapers/blob/master/int_use_of_data_first_pass) to find all countries who have a data.gov.**xx** website. The queries timeout quickly to start with, and some more may appear of I do a second pass with a longer timeout.

So now I have a list of countries with an obvious open data website name. But there are many more, such as France, who use non-standard(to my mind) naming, and many are not in a language I can speak fluently. Also - providing open or machine-readable data does not mean that they are doing anything with it themselves.

I have found a great list on github of all the repositories that are tagged as [""government""](https://github.com/github/government.github.com/blob/gh-pages/_data/governments.yml ""Github government list""), which is quite cool - and also alerted me to the fact that many federated countries have separate data portals for each state. Even more have individual city portals, so I need to look at a lot more than national level for my examples.

Still, my search goes on, and I will be more than happy to share the results, or indeed the cool things I have found that others might wish to use. My questions for the community are:

1) Could I be doing this more intelligently? It seems that other than running different levels of scraper, the analysis will be pretty manual and labour intensive. Perhaps I'm missing a trick that you could share with me for comparing similar but non-standard examples?

2) Is anyone else out there doing this? And do you think its a useful topic to explore?

3) Would you like to be involved? Or do you have any examples from your country that I might miss that you think I should be aware of?

How to succeed as an entry-level data analyst?,16,46,False,False,False,datascience,1502567946,True,"Hello all,

Back in June, I started as an entry-level data analyst on a medium-sized analytics team. I'm curious to hear what advice you have for someone in their first year out of college.

A little about me: I work mostly in R and am a solid R programmer (I work 95% in the Tidyverse and routinely write my own functions to automate routine data munging). I also have a solid background in Python, SQL, Tableau.

A little about my team: The team has a few data scientists and a number of data analysts. It is part of a medium-sized company.

Here are a few areas that I have been thinking about targeting for my personal growth over the next 3 - 6 months. Any thoughts or advice on how to improve in these areas? Any new areas I should look at?

1. Technical Skills: I am confident in my data-munging/data visualization skills. I think the next big tool to add to my toolkit is predictive modeling/machine learning. Anything else I should look into?

2. Project Management: I still struggle with appropriately scoping analyses. I often want to dive into a larger/more interesting/more accurate analysis instead of one that has limitations but that gets the job done. Right now, I tend to present my manager with my ""dream"" option and my idea of a ""scoped"" version and let her decide between the two.

3. Identifying New Projects: There are lots of areas for improvement in the company which is exciting but also daunting. Do you have any advice for how to find an area that needs improvement, pitch an analysis to my manager, and execute it with minimal management?"

I've been bouncing around with Udemy, Udacity, Coursera, etc as well as Lynda.com, Stanford videos, and some others but I still feel like I'm unclear on how to narrow my focus. 

Seems like most of the online courses (Udacity Nanodegree or most all of datacamp for example) require a fair amount of prior math or CS experience too.

Looking for an outside opinion: do data analysts provide value if they aren't using mathematical models?,14,13,False,False,False,datascience,1502581574,True,"Obviously using mathematical models is the next step, but I hear about a lot of entry-level data analyst roles where only basic SQL is needed.

Does that provide any value? I thought everyone naturally looks at data and asks questions and comes up with theories but it sounds like a lot of folks on the ""business side"" (usually non-mathematical guys) don't do that at all, or are scared of spreadsheets or something.

Need suggestions on how to learn python.,14,1,False,False,False,datascience,1502650266,True,"I'm an aspiring Data Analyst, I don't have any CS or stats background. I have got a very good hang of R(R Studio to be precise). I have also got a decent hang on statistics. I clearly understand the purpose and usage of various techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, clustering, CART's  etc. 

Now I decided to learn data scraping (that is what I find most interesting at the moment). I learnt a little bit of it on R, but python seems to be far more superior in terms of resources in this aspect. There are tools like scrapy that can do more. 

So I started learning python just the way I did with R, I did a couple of intro courses on data camp and stuff. Now I have moved onto the tutorial on scrapy's website and I'm not able to understand or do anything. Every command I copy paste from the tutorial gives me a syntax error. Moreover, after learning R, Python feels like an alien language, very difficult to remember the syntax style and stuff. Clearly I'm doing something very wrong.

Interpreting precision/recall,6,3,False,False,False,datascience,1502703297,True,"Hello! I'm a newcomer to data science and have been working on a project investigating NYT articles from 1987 and 2017. I used a naive Bayes classifier to predict which year a headline was solely on part-of-speech bigrams, and calculated the precision and recall to better assess the classifier. My understanding of this concept is not great and I was hoping someone here might be able to help me interpret the numbers.

Here are the results:

1987 precision: 0.6610486891385767

1987 recall: 0.7189409368635438

2017 precision: 0.703862660944206

2017 recall: 0.6444007858546169

My interpretation is that the low 1987 precision and low 2017 recall indicate that 2017 headlines are more likely to be misclassified as being from 1987 than vice versa. Does this say anything about the relevance of my features to one year over the other, if that makes sense? When I listed the models' most important bigrams, the top 15 were all found in larger proportions in 2017 headlines than 1987 headlines, so I thought there were a lot of strong indicators for 2017 headlines and therefore 1987 headlines were more likely to be misclassified, not the other way around.

Or is precision/recall not the most informative metric in this case?

Thank you in advance!"
"Career paths - The MOOCs, The Master Degrees and the fool.",17,16,False,False,False,datascience,1502703635,True,"Hi everyone,

Can you spend some time to help this fool decide on which paths to take on his perilous and somewhat expensive journey.\

I'm currently working as a web developer in Perth/Australia and are being moved into the role of a mini-project-officer role.  Work is relatively stable and that is why i have started to plan for the next decade.  

I have been doing a bit of research - and are considering the higher education path in order to pick up DS qualifications and skills (which doesn't always come hand in hand).  

Here are my options 
* Masters Degree at local U.  Which has a good enough reputation albeit a very very very young and untested Masters degree.  This option is probably the most expensive one - and the most lengthy and disruptive.  But i will get a fair bit more guidance and support.  The degree also comes with some forms of industry contacts and support and the local job markets are hungry for DS (or so they led me to believe).

* Online Masters degree from Coursera and the like.  Obviously not as pricey - but i wouldnt get any industry contacts and would be left to fend for myself.  

* Other smaller scale MOOCs (compared to the previous point) - definitely the most economic and in most cases the most effective as well.  But i would be left with no koalaficatons and no contacts.

*  Which leads me to the assumption that  a hybrid approach would work well then?  I could take a Graduate Certificate on the way towards the Masters degree to get my feet on the door whilst skilling up on MOOCs and the like?

Am i on the right track here?  "

Job A: 

- data scientist/software engineer position

- small company, unstable as the offer is ""contingent"" on winning a government contract, may be out of a job when contract is over

- lots of opportunities to learn (Python, Java, ML, developing algorithms)

- very challenging, very outside of my comfort zone

- very cut throat and stingy HR, little room for advancement / raises

- offered more salary, but probably ruined chances of negotiating more because my asking salary was so low and they went about $13K over my asking already

Job B:

- Marketing Intelligence Analyst

- very large and stable company, work the company does is very interesting to me

- great environment and people, beautiful office with lots of perks

- still lots of opportunities to learn for me, but probably not as much, they mainly use SAS and do things I've learned in school

- people who work here do not want to leave

- also less opportunity for advancement based on online research due to large size of company

- offer is $10K (~8K with cost of living taken into account based on locations) less than Job A, similar benefits

I think it depends on what I value more right now, but I also have some questions as well. Job A seems better for my career but B seems like a place I'd enjoy more. I've looked it up but I am wondering if I can get another perspective on the difference between a data scientist and data analyst. And if I chose B, how hard would it be to go from being a marketing data analyst to a data scientist just strictly by applying and not doing outside learning?

The data I have comes from a customer database of a commercial online product. Each data point corresponds to a specific customer and contains a whole bunch of features. Most of the features are based on recordings of how the customer uses the product, but also some information that are available at registration such as for example ”referring website”.

A new customer first signs up for a free trial that is not time based but instead based on how many times the product has been used. The customer then has the choice of subscribing for a paid version to be able to continue using it. Right now about 2% of all customers that signs up becomes paying customers. My goal is to build a model that given the feature values of a customer, predicts a probability representing the chance that the customer will subscribe for the paid version. This way it would be easier for the customer support team to identify the most valuable customers and hopefully by targeting these customers with calls, emails etc. be able to improve the conversion rate to something better than 2%.

The current model that I have built uses a snapshot in time of the feature values of a customer exactly 1 month after signing up. Given these feature values it then predicts the probability of that customer to subscribe for the paying version within an additional 5 months. I have tried different machine learning algorithms and the Gradient Boosting Machine seems to be the best performing one in this case so that is the one I am using right now. The model performs rather well on test data with an AUC above 90%. One problem though is that the number of positive outcomes in the historical data is rather limited so far, which I am aware of will reduce the credibility of the model. With my current model design I can only consider customers that have been signed up for a minimum of 6 months for training (as I do not know the ”outcome” before then) which further reduces the amount of training data.

Now I am thinking about potential ways to improve the model design, both to be able to use a larger portion of the training data, but also to improve the benefits of the model. Right now I can only use the model on new customers that have been signed up for exactly 1 month. This is of course not ideal since many times you would like to target a customer long before 1 month and sometimes you will miss out on potential customers to target that stay quiet for the first month and then starts using the product more frequently later on. 

What would be ideal is a model that updates the conversion probability of a customer as the activity of the customer changes over time. For example it would give a prediction once a day or once a week based on the current feature values of the customer. I am not really sure how to build a model like this in a good way. One approach would be to treat the ”time since signup” as a feature of its own. Then I would be able to get a prediction regardless of how long time the customer have been signed up. Another option would be to use something like a recurrent neural network to be able to catch time dependencies in the data even better.

I will stop elaborating on my thoughts here to keep the post length reasonable. As I said before, I appreciate any suggestions, thoughts or links to similar examples! Thank you for taking the time to read this!

(x-post r/jobs),7,2,False,False,False,datascience,1502813417,True,"I was screened for the first round, completed my data exercise (second round), and went to my first in-person and met with 2 VPs, 2 C-levels and president, and a couple of data scientists, which definitely exceeded the total amount of high level execs I've met in my lifetime.


Their recruiter mentioned that the data science team thought the exercise was great, and more recently that everyone had a great time meeting me and learning about my background.


Now they want me to come in (for what I presume is the final round) to meet with a dual C-level and ""have more time"" with the VP Marketing. Does that seem necessary? Did the marketing guy likely not trust my skillset? Is it a formality? Is this normal for a data science role to meet all these execs? Is it okay to ask the recruiter if it's the final interview and if the marketing guy will be giving me some brain teasers or short problem sets (which he did the first time)?


The last interview burned me out but also got me super excited. The thought of having to go in and do it again for a couple of less people is a bit demotivating. Just want more advice about what to expect and how I should go about this."

I'm quite satisfied with my job and I love computer science in general but I'm looking for something more tightly coupled to my studies and to theoretical subjects, like math, stats or physics.

I currently live in Italy but I'm looking forward to relocate to central Europe (Germany and Holland are my best choice)

Given my current state, would it be a realistic idea to transition to data science?

In this case, what would be a good approach for studying/finding a job? At the moment I'm currently studying a bit of ML (i.e. the Shalev-Shwartz book and the NG coursera course).

I'm also looking forward for a PhD in theoretical physics. In that case, the choice would be perhaps a better fit, given my background, and I read that doctorands are very well accepted in data science fields.

Currently, the approach I came up with is:

1. Wrangle the text into a document-term matrix (DTM)
2. Convert the DTM into a term-term co-occurrence matrix or TTM (using the algebraic trick of inner product multiplication of the transpose of the DTM by itself
3. Perform dimensionality reduction (PCA) on the TTM
4. Take the first k (let's say 50) principal components and construct a new DTM matrix where each term is replaced by a 50-dimensional vector space

I then use the vector space matrix as input for the ML model.

- Building basic models (linked above)

- Generating feature hypotheses and iterating on a model

- Writing reusable and shareable code to get rid of cut and paste

- Using a database to back your modeling efforts

Our team wants to focus on the Deep Learning approach to general AI so we are specifically looking for people with experience and ambition to succeed in this particular field. Your position in such a group aids both the quality of it as a whole as much as it aids you to better yourself since you’ll have access to many other deep learners with whom you can discuss area-specific concerns. Of course, to create such a community we need to implement a safeguard in the form of an interview/ exam to ensure that we are both headed in the same direction. Bear in mind that down the line this chat-room is also a prospect for professional employment so your temporal investment will most likely also pay out in the literal sense, should you choose to engage in the commercial side of things.

This project will be a **paid** venture for anyone who chooses to assist in the development of any product that comes from it.

CV critique and job application advice - will reimburse with pictures of my dog,9,16,False,False,False,datascience,1503053414,True,"Hello, my name's Emma and I'm a final year PhD candidate applying for data science roles.

[**CV**] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LopatLNCiWIPeE_EWsNIHIhh3_JyYBpWvoIaVzImXcs/edit?usp=sharing)

* What level should I be pitching myself at? So far I've been applying for 'data scientist' roles, but I've also seen job adverts for 'entry level' and 'junior' data scientists.

* Does it matter that I don't have Python experience? I have 4.5 years of experience with R, but so many of the jobs that interest me list Python as an essential. I'm keen to learn Python. How common is it to learn on the job?

* Should I include SQL on my CV if I only have minimal experience? I can use run a basic SQL query with comparison and logical operators, but I can't do anything fancy.

* Does it matter that I'm not interested in one specific sector? While there are certain companies and areas that have perked my interest (e.g. FinTech social enterprise start-ups), I'm looking for a role that asks interesting questions of complex datasets in an environment that supports professional development. I'm worried my lack of in-depth knowledge of any one sector may count against me.

**edit** Sorry this was totally unclear. This is for their data scientist position specifically. For their data scientist positions they hire for the whole company then once they choose to hire you they do the matching afterwards. Your interviewers come from a variety of teams. That's why I didn't specify a team/unit, and honestly why I feel like it's hard for me to target what I should be focusing my studying on. I've done a generic overview of my stats courses and now I'm trying to figure out what I should be practicing.

Very noisy problem: how to use a model with above-average AUC but terrible precision on positive event class?,7,3,False,False,False,datascience,1503060155,True,"I have a dataset in which only 0.5% (1 in 200) records corresponds to the positive class (there around 500,000 total records). I have spent weeks doing feature engineering on categorical, continuous, and **text** columns (you can imagine how horrible the latter endeavor was, given 500,000 rows).

The classifier I've built gives me about 0.80 AUC, which I'm happy with -- that tells me the model is okay at discriminating between the classes. But precision on the positive class is absolutely shit -- about 2%. It's much more important to minimize false negatives than false positive in my case.

How can I use this model going forward? The tool into which it will be integrated is meant very much to be a **tool** -- not a system that replaces human judgement (i.e. a human will still have to review each sample, but use the tool as a little reference/context guide). Obviously if there were no human-in-the-loop setup, this model would go awry quickly.... Thoughts?"

Data scientist vs. full stack developer,2,2,False,False,False,datascience,1503069860,True,"Data science and full stack development are obviously two different fields. One focuses on statistics and machine learning, the other focuses a lot more on coding.

Obviously, developers do not focus on statistics and machine learning like data scientists do. However, could we see a future where data scientists with the sufficient programming skills oscillate between data science, and more full stack development oriented roles?

Does it worth to get a CITS certificate to become a Data Analyst?,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1503073191,True,"So my goal is to become a Data Analyst, I always wanted to be in this field but my university didn't provide many classes related to this profession except statistics.

My background is: my finance: investment degree, couple C# classes, and SQL (basic knowledge) from EDX website.

I signed up for CITS classes in my town to get a certificate, it's a one year program. They have some python electives there. But I don't know if it would be more helpful/efficient than getting specific courses from online like python, R, and SQL? Do I need this general knowledge from CITS to become a Data Analyst?

Undergrad Summer Internship and Career Advice in Data Science,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1503083605,True,"Hello, I'm currently a senior majoring in Computational Data Sciences at Penn State. I plan on studying an extra semester so I have another summer to look for internships, which I really want to take advantage of. 

I'm kind of worried since most of the data science intern positions seem to require more technical skills than I currently possess - I've only taken two data science courses that are relevant to the field - a general intro course where I dabbed in SQL and other NoSQL fields (eg: Mongo, Neo4J) and a course in R. I haven't touched other subjects such as machine learning yet at all - I was originally a computer science major so most of the courses I've taken were upper level comp sci courses such as algorithms and programming language concepts. 

My GPA is also quite low (3.04) and I don't have many data science related projects nor previous work experience to show on my resume. I was wondering if you all had any advice for my internship search in the following year. 

Also, since this whole data science program is new at my school, I'm very unsure about my future plans upon graduation. Right now, I'm looking to get an entry-level data scientist job upon graduation, but if that falls short I might end up preparing for graduate school in Data Sciences or a related field. My worries are that my GPA isn't high enough, I don't have too much work experience, and I may not have the skills needed upon graduation. What does it take for someone to get an entry-level data science job upon graduation? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks."
How can I incorporate marketable data science skills into my PhD physics research?,13,12,False,False,False,datascience,1503084030,True,"I'm a PhD physics candidate with about two years left before I graduate. I've decided not to pursue a career in academia and I'm interested in moving into data science after I graduate.

My research is in particle physics and my day-to-day work is programming and data analysis. This *sounds* like a pretty good background for an aspiring data scientist but I feel like my skills and experience are so specific to particle physics that it would be difficult to sell myself for a data science job. I'm essentially a self-taught programmer and data analyst who's learnt just enough programming and data analysis to enable me to do my research and nothing more.

I realised this probably wasn't going to get me a job so I've recently started learning some new skills/tools and incorporating them into my work where possible. I'm teaching myself python and I switched my analysis code from C++ to python. I'm going to try switching my histogramming from [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) to matplotlib and I might be able to find some excuses to use pandas for some number crunching.

Does anyone have any other suggestions? In particular, are there any ex-particle physicists here who can advise me on how to avoid pigeonholing myself as someone who can only do ROOT-based cut-and-count analyses?"

But despite all that, if you look at job postings, they're almost exclusively looking for folks with at least one PhD.

My own feelings on the matter are that it's possible to get into data science without a PhD (I did it), but that graduate-level quantitative research skills are generally necessary for the job, and that it's exceedingly difficult to learn those skills without practicing those skills in an environment that matters.

Additionally, while I believe that programming skills are something most people can pick up from an online course (lots of great Python courses, and even a few R courses), I think that coding is just the tip of the iceberg -- a good data scientist needs to have a solid understanding of math and statistics so as to be able to develop a decent model, and those skills are much more difficult to develop through independent study.

Ultimately, I see these data science courses like I'd view a course on how to swing a hammer -- you might develop the skills needed to use the tools, but it's a huge jump from having functional knowledge on how to use woodworking tools and being a professional carpenter.

How does everyone else feel about all of the online data science courses, books, etc.?

Looking for Peer-Collaborators on Data Science Resume Projects (Python / R).,8,4,False,False,False,datascience,1503258304,True,"I'm looking for people who want to collaborate on data science resume-builder projects and help each other isolate and upgrade our knowledge/skill gaps. Collaboration is a powerful tool. 

**The Vision:**

My vision for this is, to an extent, flexible and open-ended. Here is what I'm proposing at this point: 

* Put together teams of about five peers; people who have similar interests and skillsets.
* Each team will decide upon the team's project.
* Each team will execute the project, help fellow team members isolate and fill in knowledge/skill gaps.
* The results and process of the project will be published on the web. 

Part of my philosophy is that *doing Data Science* is the best way to learn Data Science. Learn Data Science the same way we'd train a machine learning model: apply, learn, apply, learn. 

Trying to replicate someone else's work can be an effective way to learn the skills required to create the work in the first place. It may also be possible to make a contribution to the work or created additional analysis output. I'd like to try to replicate studies like [this one](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6o0g-zB7-SnTVBRN1NQQ3NfcnM) or [this one](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6o0g-zB7-SnMzM5QWxXXzVtSFk). These are merely examples. 

It could turn into something big. Maybe we could eventually create a website where people can take a survey/test to get graded on skill level and interests and get matched up with people who also want to collaborate on projects. It could turn into something sort of like Toastmasters, but instead of helping people get better at public speaking, we'd help people get better at Data Science. 

I think that the teams need to be composed of about five peers. After selecting the first team, I'll start to pick leaders/organizers for additional teams. Each team will be independent, and we will compare notes on what we are doing. We'll start a Slack channel where everyone can communicate in a central location. Individuals will collaborate on teams, and teams will collaborate with each other in a [Team of Teams](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486) fashion. 

A primary goal will be an exercise in technical / analytical skills, and another primary goal will be to exercise soft skills, e.g. project management and working on a team of like-minded individuals.

What is my motivation for starting this project? I want to greatly improve my skillset in this area and building a network of like-minded individuals is a powerful boost to this goal. That is it. 

**Ideal Person:**

* You are serious about evolving your data science skillset and you want to work with other people to do so.
* You're willing/able to spend a minimum of five hours per week working on projects that your team decides to work on.
* You are entrepreneurial, resourceful and embrace a ""fail forward"" and ""agile"" philosophy. I'm proposing that we build something here, there will be a lot of decisions to make and things won't always go as planned. 

I'm looking to create *peer* groups, i.e. [*a person of the same age, status, or ability as another specified person.*](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+peers&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS723US723&amp;oq=define+peers&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59.1448j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). I want to be the coordinator and a participant of the first group, so here is a description of myself: 


&gt; I'm a millennial interested in data science. I recently graduated college with a degree in Economics, studied math/statistics/computer science as well. I have a job as a business analyst at a technology company. I have several years of job experience (some before college). In my current role I'm basically creating a lot of descriptive statistics and wrangling data. My company doesn't have an analytics department currently, and I want to help start one at this company. 

&gt; The term ""Data Science"" [seems a lot like a buzzword](https://www.quora.com/Is-Data-Science-a-meme-term-or-a-buzzword) to me, so I'll be clear about what I think of when I use the phrase. Data Science is a cross-section between machine learning, computer science and statistics. A Data Scientist is someone who uses a variety of techniques to analyze data with the aim of finding insights in the data and/or building applications which exploit data. 

&gt; I've been writing Python for a couple of years now and I use the Python/Pandas/R nexus on a daily basis. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being a capable and experienced data scientist, my current skillset is around a 5. I think that going from 0-5 is a lot easier than going from 5-10. Technically, I'm at a developmental point where the challenges I face are less ""how do I get the program to do xyz"" and more ""what xyz do I need to use to analyze/model this data."" 

&gt; I'm interested in social issues like climate change, income inequality and money in politics. I strive to have opinions on these topics that are based on logic and empiricism. I see replication projects as a great way to 1) develop my analytical skills and 2) develop my views on things that are interesting to me. I'm also interested in business analytics applications (it is how I make a living). 


**How to Apply:**

Write a cover letter similar to the one I wrote above in block quotes. It must have these four things:

* ~500 characters describing you in general. 
* ~500 characters describing what you think about when you think about Data Science.
* ~500 characters describing your current technical skillset. 
* ~500 characters describing applications of Data Science which interest you. 

Writing something like this can be a good exercise in itself. Send it in an email to locking.it.down.806@gmail.com. Please include the phrase ""data science collaborator"" in the subject. I look forward to hearing from everyone. I'd also like to hear any thoughts. "

Springboard data science career track and Insight,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1503273594,True,"

Hi, all

I am graduating next spring with Ph.D. in Physics (high energy, CERN), and I am preparing a transition to data science. Initially, I was interested in Insight data science program, but recently I have learned about Springboard data science career track. Based on the reviews I read, both seem to be solid programs for the preparation for data science.

So I would like to ask a few questions for those who went to either of those programs or know well about them.

- what is the demography of these programs? I know that Insight requires Ph.D, so the most of people who apply to Insight must be people transitioning from academia like me. Is it also true for Springboard data science program? On the website, they only require Bachelors, so I am curious about the demography of this program.

- I am interested in these program mainly because of the possibility to build network and get to know people in data science field. Any thoughts on the difference between these programs in terms of network building (mentorship vs whatever Insight provides)?

- any thoughts on the quality of these programs? Any difference in terms of a position or companies that people got hired after completing either of these program?

Some worries that I've seen after doing research: The Kx suite that they work in is owned by First Derivatives so I'm not sure how truly useful this work experience would be anywhere other than First Derivatives. Additionally, there are a lot of complaints I see about the program, but I know that the people who are most likely to write anything at all are more likely to be those who had a bad experience. Lastly, I'm not so sure about my initial assessment of First Derivatives as a ""top tier global company"" which is based on looking around their website. "

I don't really like statistics. Should DS be off the table?,33,2,False,False,False,datascience,1503316459,True,"For reference I'm an undergraduate in the process of figuring out areas of interest under the computer science umbrella.

I've been spending a lot of time this summer learning about data analysis online and through projects. I really like a lot of the process—mining, cleaning, exploring, modeling, and visualizing data is all quite fun. Writing up reports is great too, if I've got something interesting to share. However, any statistical testing that comes into the picture ends up being something of a chore. Admittedly my current knowledge of stats is pretty basic, but as it stands the thought of getting a Masters or PhD in a statistics-heavy field to realistically be considered for anything higher than an analyst role is unattractive.

Right now I see my choices as being either to suck it up if I want to work with data, or opt for a different path, i.e. software development. Is my perception of my options - or more broadly, the significance/usage of statistics in most DS roles - correct?

Neural Network for Group Membership?,3,5,False,False,False,datascience,1503340043,True,"## The Data:

Lets say I had a dataset from an online shopping platform with the following tables:

**Transactions:** each row is a purchase made on a shopping website:

| transaction_id | customer_id | product_key | price | product_name | 
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------------| 
| 00001          | 3424        | 3254325     | 19.99 | ""blue jeans"" | 
| 00002          | 3123        | 3214321     | 3.00  | ""socks""      | 
| 00003          | 9982        | 2134551     | 33.33 | ""sneakers""   | 
|...|

**Classes**: A mapping of customer_id and true class:

| customer_id | true_class          | 
|-------------|---------------------| 
| 0001        | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| 0002        | non\_provlem\_shopper | 
| 0003        | problem_shopper     | 
| 0004        | problem_shopper     | 
| 0005        | problem_shopper     | 
| ...         |                     | 

## The Goal:

My goal is to categorize specific customers as ""Problem Shopper"" (addicted to online shopping) or ""Non-Problem Shopper"".

Is there a way that I can feed my transaction data as shown above into an artificial neural net and get predictions as of ""Problem Shopper"" or ""Non-Problem Shopper"" assuming I had a list of customer_id's that were true problem shoppers for training and testing. Like so:

| customer_id | true_class          | predicted_class     | 
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------| 
| 0001        | non\_problem\_shopper | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| 0002        | non\_provlem\_shopper | problem_shopper     | 
| 0003        | problem_shopper     | problem_shopper     | 
| 0004        | problem_shopper     | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| 0005        | problem_shopper     | non\_problem\_shopper | 
| ...         |                     |                     | 

I have experience doing binary classification problems with typical training and testing sets but in this case I want to use all of the information contained in the _transactions_ table but then predict the class by just giving the algorithm a set of customer_id's.

## The Question

How can I structure the data and/or neural net to learn from the entire transactions table _but make predictions solely based on the customer\_id_?

Any suggestions, tips, resources, etc. in general would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

"Remote Computing with Python, VIM, MOSH, and TMUX: Better alternatives to jupyter, x forwarding or x2go?",1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1503351670,True,"Hi all,

For context, I've been using neural networks built with tensorflow to quantify objects in microscope images that I've generated as part of my current research project. For training, I upload images from the microscope computer to a remote server via rsync (Xubuntu running GTX 1070s). Until recently, I heavily utilized Jupyter Notebook by forwarding the port pointing to the jupyter server on my remote machine via SSH to my laptop. I would start the server in a TMUX session which I connected to via MOSH, giving an incredibly responsive terminal.

Recently, I've fallen for VIM and have been using it with MOSH, TMUX, and vim-vinegar to manage my projects. When I need to either view an image output from my scripts or view a matplotlib plot, I cannot use the MOSH-TMUX session due to the lack of support for X forwarding in MOSH. I could run everything through a standard SSH, but I was hoping to keep the responsiveness/keep alive aspects of MOSH while still coding in vim and being able to view remote pictures via EOG/feh/ImageMagick. For pictures, I can open an X2Go session on my remote machine or open a second SSH session and view a picture remotely via eog x11 forwarding (not via MOSH). The first option seems a little excessive and clunky (I don't like taking my hands off the keyboard). The second option, even with compression, is very slow for large images due to my understanding limitations in how x forwarding draws images. Even worse is matplotlib outputs, as I have to run the python script from the terminal windows sporting the SSH connection with x11 forwarding rather than the MOSH connection.

Does anyone have a similar workflow with a more attractive implementation? Thank you and sorry for the word soup!"

R solution for high performance and large datasets,7,1,False,False,False,datascience,1503393672,True,"Hi,

Up until now I have relied on RStudio installed on my local machine to do data analysis tasks.

I am trying to figure out what would be the best setup for an improved performance on large datasets while still working in the R language, but I am kind of confused at the moment.

The company I work for are Microsoft partners so I guess I will use Azure HDInsight to setup storage and clusters. I think it would be a good thing to setup a Spark Cluster? But I am not sure what's the best way to connect to this cluster through R. I guess it can be done using a Spark package from RStudio, or I could use Microsoft R server?

I'm sorry for being so vague but it's because I don't really understand how these different parts relates to each other at the moment. I would be very happy if someone could suggest a setup for me and/or explain a little more about the possible solutions. Perhaps you know of any good tutorials covering this subject?

Each of these corresponds to a particular item ID number and type ID, though I don't know which. The full set of item ID numbers and type numbers are very large, but known. The objective is to match a row from the descriptions table to its corresponding item and type ID.

An example of what the data looks like:

Description|
:--|
FT100-32/11-8|
gg782=okay|

These might match up with corresponding items:

ItemID|TypeID|
:--|:--|
FT100|32/11|
gg7|82|

In other words, the ""descriptions"" are usually some string which contain bits of the item ID, bits of the type ID, sometimes mis-spelled, sometimes incomplete, often containing a lot of other junk that isn't relevant. So for example, item ID ""F16"" of type ""32-b-c"" might be written in the description as ""F32bc"", ""F16/32bc"", or various other alternatives.  The format/structure of descriptions are not consistent either.

I've started with a horrifying number of regexes but there are just so many possibilities. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on a probabilistic approach which could give me likely matches based on e.g. string transformation distance. There seems to be a lot of literature out there for similar things processing natural language, broken up neatly by spaces, but what to do when your ""words"" are strings within random garbage strings?

How to store/access mostly non-numerical and non-homogeneous data for video game stats/events,3,9,False,False,False,datascience,1503456688,True,"Hey guys. I'm working on a small project in my free time on competitive gaming analysis. In particular, I'm looking at data for the Xbox One game, Halo 5: Guardians. In theory, my analysis could focus on any game, but this is what I'm working on, so we'll use it as an example. **My question is: how should I go about storing/accessing the data?** I'm looking at match events, which give you a play by play of what happened in any single game. The data is not homogeneous and isn't completely (or even mostly) numerical. For example, there's an event for when a player spawns, when a player picks up a weapon, when a player dies, when someone captures a flag, etc. Each of these events will have its own set of fields (for example, a player spawn event will only tell you who spawned and when, while a player death event has fields for the victim, the killer, each of their locations on the map, the weapons they possessed, etc). You can access this data using the API that the game developers have supplied. The data comes in the JSON format. 

I'm an engineer by trade, so I use MATLAB very often. While I have some *real* programming experience in C++ and Python, I'm much more comfortable with MATLAB, and I've been using that so far. I make the HTTP requests through MATLAB, parse the JSON data in MATLAB, and store the data in MATLAB proprietary binary files. I then load those files later and perform whatever analysis I want to, also using MATLAB. Now, I know the shortcomings of MATLAB, and I've felt them. Right now, I have to save each match's event files in a separate file, and call them into memory one by one if I want to look at them. I've identified over 350,000 games of interest, but I've only downloaded the match events for about 8000 of them. This represents a gigabyte in disk space (when saved as binary files). However, if I tried to load all of these files into MATLAB at once, it would take over 60 GB of RAM, which is more than the physical RAM I have on my machine, and thus makes any analysis exceedingly slow. I have resorted to only using subsets of the match event files at a time. 

From what I'm reading about other people's work in big data (which I'm not sure this would qualify as, yet), it is common to build relational databases, especially for data that is primarily non-numerical. I have no experience with databases or SQL or anything in that realm. Is that what you would recommend doing? I can imagine it would keep things tidier, though I don't know how it would stack up performance wise. I really have no intuition in this field, so I'm hoping I can gain some insight here. And I'm fully willing to start working in a different language if that is more natural for using databases.

Sorry if this question is too broad, not appropriate for this subreddit, or has already been asked. I did search for similar topics but I didn't find anything too closely related to what I want to know, and I didn't really know what exactly to search for. I really appreciate any and all feedback, and I will do my best to provide whatever details are needed to paint a clearer picture. Thank you very much."

How do you run long experiments with Neural Networks?,2,5,False,False,False,datascience,1503500128,True,"Hi, 

Building a NN model includes fine-tuning many parameters including hyper-parameters, architecture, vectorization and more. In most cases it's very hard to know in advance what will work best, and a very common answer to questions like ""What learning rate should I use?"" is ""Do cross validation and some kind of grid search and find the best value"".
The problem is that training a network takes a lot of time (hours or days). 

What is the best strategy here?
Should I try different things on small subset of the data and hope it will work the same way when Ill train on the whole set? 
Also, what is your general strategy when training a network? Do build a network that overfits the training set at first and then handle it using different techniques? or do you try to build the best network from the start? 
Any general advice will help.

To Index Data is To Sort Data,0,0,False,False,False,datascience,1503651746,True,"By JIANG Buxing, Founder &amp; Chief Data Scientist of Raqsoft


Indexing is commonly used among programmers. Without fully grasping the idea behind the technique, a programmer is always eager to take advantage of it whenever they encounter a query performance problem, only to get disappointed by the result on many occasions. By analyzing the principle of indexing, the article tries to show programmers when is the appropriate time to use an index and how to use it. 

Basic idea
The purpose of indexing is to quickly find the records where the value of a certain field is equivalent to a given value (find the right person according to an ID card number, for instance). For a data set with a certain scale (N rows), searching an eligible record using a full traversal needs N comparisons. If the data set is sorted by the target field (called the key for an index), we can use the binary search by creating a binary tree. This way the number of comparisons is logN (base 2). For example, only 30 comparisons are needed for a data set with a billion rows (2^30 comparisons if a billion records are traversed), thereby causing a great performance increase. The key values could be duplicated (find people according to birthdays, for instance); or there is probably a query according to a certain range of key values (find people who were born in a certain period of time). In both scenarios, the number of comparisons is bigger than logN but remains of the same order of magnitude.

To index data is to sort data.

Of course we won’t really sort the original data set. Instead, we create an index, a smaller data set, which stores the key values of all records and the records’ positions in the original data set in a table sorted by the key values. If more fields are specified for key value searching, we can also create an index over each of these fields. For one original data set, multiple different indexes are allowed. But if the original data set is sorted and replicated each time when an index is created, the space consumption could be huge.

Database is designed to take data insertion and deletion into consideration when creating an index. An index with a simple sorting makes the insertion and deletion a costly process. For this reason, a B-tree is used to facilitate the data update. A B-tree is the result of extending a binary tree into an n-ary tree, with data still sorted by key values. (We’ll discuss how to create an index, which covers a lot of aspects, in another article; here we only focus on how to use them.)

There is a further way, hash index, which calculates the hash values of the key values in all records. These hash values are natural numbers falling into the range from 1 to k, and they can be used to locate records directly without a binary search. The hash method finds key values according to a specified exact value, not an interval, because the hash function isn’t a monotonic function and doesn’t show the original order of the key values any more. Yet the method is sufficient in handling many scenarios (like finding a person by ID card number). At its heart, a hash index is also about sorting, according to the hash values of the key values. The following discussion takes the ordinary indexing for example but the conclusion also applies to the hash index.

In view of how the index works, it can’t increase the full traversal performance. So, it’s inappropriate to use an index to improve the performance of grouping and aggregation. 

Single-field Indexes
With a deep understanding about the idea behind indexing, we know the right occasions to use an index and how to write the code properly. 

1. It is very effective with a condition on key values, like finding the person whose ID card number is equivalent to the given value, or finding people who were born in a certain period of time;

2. Most of the time, it is ineffective if the condition is a function of the key values. Other times whether an index can be used depends on the degree of database optimization. Take a scenario where the index key is Birthday but the condition is people who were born on a certain day of a week for example. An ordinary index won’t work because it isn’t sorted by the days of a week. We need to create an index over the function of the key values. That type of index is supported by most databases. Another example is finding people who are in a certain age group with the index key as Birthday. We can’t use an index directly, either. As there is a monotonic relationship between the age and the birthday, a properly optimized database may enable the use of index, which, however, is rarely seen. Besides, phrase a query condition directly over the values of index key, rather than over their function or an expression. 

3. It is effective if a general search condition separated by AND puts the condition over key values at the outermost layer, like finding people who were born on a certain date and whose names contain a certain character. The database will first filter out those who were born on this date using the index, and then find those whose names contain a given character. All modern commercial databases are capable of analyzing a conditional expression intelligently to find the part for which an index can be used to speed up the searching. But for a condition that finds people who were born on a certain date or whose names contain a certain character, the index becomes useless. Since only a traversal can be used for the second part of the condition, the database will skip the indexing to perform a traversal directly.

So it would be better to write the condition over the key values at the outmost layer of a compound search condition separated by AND. Performance can only be enhanced when the index key can be used to narrow down the searching range.

Multi-field Indexes  
Suppose we create indexes over all the fields involved in a searching condition, will that lead to a stronger performance boost?

The answer is a disappointing “No”, according to the idea previously introduced. In most cases, only one index over a single field is useful.

There are a search condition A=1 AND B=2, and two indexes created over field A and field B separately. First index A is used to find records where the value of field A is 1; but as these records aren’t ordered by field B, a traversal is still needed to find the records meeting the condition B=2. We’ll face the same situation since the records filtered out with index B according to the condition B=2 are not ordered by field A. A commercial database will assess the situation and choose an index whose filtered data set is smaller. 

Both indexes might be useful if the search condition is A=1 OR B=2. A properly optimized database has the ability of using both indexes separately to filter the original data set according to A=1 and B=2, and then performing a union.

We can also build a multi-field index over both fields. The result set after filtering according to A=1 is now also ordered by field B, and thus it can be further filtered using the index according to B=2. A database, if perfectly optimized, identifies A=1 AND B=2 and B=2 AND A=1 as the same condition, so the order of the different parts of a compound search condition is allowed to be different from the order of the index keys, though the situation discussed in the 3rd case in the last section should be noted: it is preferable that a condition on the index key is written at the outermost layer.

Yet the double-field index over field A and field B doesn’t work when being applied to B=2, because an index ordered by both field A and field B doesn’t necessarily ordered by field B. To find records according to B=2, the only choice is to perform a traversal. But a multi-field index tends to steer programmers wrong. In fact, a multi-field index over fields A, B and C is valid for conditions including A=?, A=? AND B=? and A=? AND B=? AND C=?, but it is invalid for conditions including B=?，C=?，B=? AND C=?. An additional index over field B or field C is needed.

Since a multi-field index over field A, field B and field C is valid for conditions A, A/B and A/B/C, should we create as many index keys as possible? It seems we should according to its principle. With an index table getting bigger, however, the I/O cost will increase accordingly. So the decision should come from a good assessment about a situation.

Index and traversal
Is a correctly created and properly used index a guarantee of performance boost?

Not necessarily!

The purpose of using an index is getting records according to key values. In most cases, a relatively small number of records are expected to be retrieved from a huge data set. On those occasions, a suitable index, if used properly, will surely give a big boost to the retrieval performance. On other occasions where a lot of records may be retrieved through a conditional traversal, performance might or might not be improved, even could be worse.

Here is the reason:

As mentioned earlier, we create a separate index instead of sorting the original data set. Data retrieved based on the index is not continuously stored in the original data set, even totally disordered if the database isn’t properly optimized. Retrieving a large amount of discontinuous data from the hard disk will be accompanied by the retrieval of a lot of irrelevant data. The data retrieval time shouldn’t be calculated simply according to the amount of data to be retrieved. More importantly, the performance increase brought by the use of an index is limited, not as much as expected. 

Retrieving data in a discontinuous way according to the index may cause duplicate data retrieval. For an HDD, it is most probably that a traversal is better than the index-based retrieval in performance due to a large number of time-consuming head jumps, if the result set is very large. Usually a commercial database will assess the cost before deciding the way to retrieve data. If any adverse conditions exist, the index-based data retrieval method will be abandoned. Generally the performance is no worse than that of the traversal. But if the cost assessment is not as precise as expected, a wrong data retrieval method may result in a worse performance. 
Generally the database data is stored in the order of insertion. If the order is in line with the order of the values of the index key, the data retrieved will be physically stored in a relatively continuous way. In this situation, the index-based filtering can bring a considerably performance increase, even if the retrieved amount of data is large.

Anyone here work at a macro fund or in macroeconomic research? Need advice on MS Econ or MS Data Science,11,1,False,False,False,datascience,1503702613,True,"**My goal:** To work at a macro hedge fund. 


**My background:**
 
-Bachelor's economics, 3.9

-Genuine interest in economics (&amp; finance), thought hard about grad school after Bachelor's

-Took up to intro discrete math during undergrad (Calc, LinAlg, DiffEq, Intro Proofs) to prep for grad school (did not take Real Analysis+)

-Worked in finance (equity research) after school for 3.5 years. About a year of this is working in the crude oil tanker space. 

-Quit my equity research job in 2015 (for various reasons) and I thought Python, R, SQL would help me getter a better job in finance. Began dabbling on Codecademy: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python. 

-Accepted to a two-year research **master's in economics** and accepted to a two-year research **master's in data science**.

**Questions:**

1. Which of these routes should I pursue if I want to work in macro research, MS Econ or MS Data Science? 

2. MS Econ will require (re)learning R and STATA. MS Data Science will expose me to MySQL, Python, and Java. 
Are skills like database management more important for macro jobs and thus will I be better off with Data Science or is R and STATA enough since econ grad coursework is more important?

Looking for a little bit of advice about where to go from here,10,11,False,False,False,datascience,1503737321,True,"First, some background. So I just finished a MA in economics. Took several courses in statistics, including 2 PhD econometrics courses. Obviously, none of it covered statistical learning/machine learning. Thats why I'm reading ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R"" and I'm already in the last chapter.I feel pretty comfortable with what I read, since in basic theory and application  the grand majority of it is quite easy to understand. My issues are as follows:

1) First off, is there any difference, besides terminology, between statistical learning and machine learning? I'm somewhat confused by this, since I've read both that statistical learning is just a part of machine learning but also that its ""pretty much the same thing, with different terms"".

2) Where to go from here? My plan atm is to take a data analyst job to work more on my R and SQL on the job while learning python and more machine learning as well on my free time. I'm not sure how helpful the experience as a data analyst would be tho. Besides that, my issue is also what to read next when it comes to machine learning. My hope is that there is another book which is practical like ISL but covers the parts that it doesn't, like neural networks, so I can learn to apply it before working. I haven't found anything like this tho, sadly. If a book like that doesn't exist then I would have to move to deeper books(like ""Elements of Statistical Learning"") that take more time, so I won't be able to learn it before getting a job sadly. Admittedly however, I don't know if this is the right book either.

3) Lastly, and this is a more fundamental question, to what extent do I need to know SL or ML to work as a data scientist? Being able to apply the techniques is an obvious requisite, but with regards to the actual theoretical knowledge I mean. Would I need to reach a high enough expertise to do research on the topic or is have an understanding of the statistical theory behind it enough?

So those 3 are my issues, an answer for the 1st and 3rd and some suggestions with regards to the 2nd would be greatly appreciated."

Help making a career shift from marketing to data analyst with very little mathematical/technical background,6,0,False,False,False,datascience,1503889202,True,"Hi everyone,

I currently work in Facebook marketing, and I'd like to move into data analysis so that I can begin developing the skills and knowledge one needs for full-fledged data science. I graduated with a BA in Psychology, so as of now, I unfortunately have little in the way of mathematical or programming experience. Here's what I do have:

- One uni class on making basic games/programs in Java
- One class on using STATA to perform some relatively straightforward regressions and visualizations on large datasets
- Intro statistics (linear regression, chi squared, z- and t-tests, that kind of thing)
- Intro calculus (2 of the 3 classes that CS majors would typically take in their freshman year)
- A conceptual understanding of several ML concepts (thanks to a cognitive science class)

Before anyone asks if I'm really sure I want to learn this--some have expressed doubt in other forums--I have a deep interest in understanding how to implement DS/ML techniques. One can't put interest on a resume, of course, but I genuinely get chills when I read about the applications of DS &amp; ML to social good-oriented purposes, and it is a skillset I'm absolutely certain about learning.

Given my somewhat unconventional background, what do you think is the most efficient path from where I am now to a data analyst role? Your input would be very much appreciated. "
Advice/guidance needed for a case study for a Data Science interview,3,5,False,False,False,datascience,1503904120,True,"Hi All,

As part of the interview process of a data science role, I have been given a take home case study.  The context is that the company has purchased data and want me to present my findings and recommendations to a non-technical audience. The problem is essentially a regression supervised learning but I think the predicted values themselves aren't as important as opposed to the rank of the predictions. 

Although I have a technical background, I have never done data science before (i.e. analyse a dataset, build models and glean insights) so I've been spending my last few days furiously learning R and regression algorithms.

Without asking for help to solve this specific problem, I'm hoping to get some guidance. 

My overall plan is this:

* Focus on learning 3 types of regression models due to time constraints (linear regression, decision trees, random forests)
* Investigate data, train regression models on the training set
* Identify which features are significant and understand if they make sense (I'm thinking this doesn't apply to random forest as they are more black box)
* Compare performance of regression models on the test data set
* Based on results, come up with summary of findings and recommendations in the business context

My questions are:

1. Does my approach make sense i.e. fit small number of regression algorithms, focus on findings and recommendations as opposed to fitting fancy models
2. What are the key things I should be focusing on when communicating results?
3. What does the scope of recommendations likely include? (e.g. data doesn't have much value so don't investigate further, purchase more data to get better understanding)
4. Is there a detailed tutorial for R on how to fit a regression tree using rpart in terms of choosing the parameters, assessing goodness of fit etc?
5. Is there an automated way in R to do stepwise regression for fitting a linear model?

Also open to hear how other people fared in similar situations. "

I am currently a self-taught DevOps engineer with 6 years of experience with Linux system design and administration, software lifecycle (build and test pipelines) management, and programming primarily in Python. Through one of my previous companies I became very interested in data science, as we worked with our in-house data scientists to build a streaming pipeline and analytics infrastructure from thousands of customer devices.

Because I only finished 2 years of generals in college before leaving, I want to finish my undergrad degree (at least), and I'm rather light on the maths fundamentals. So my primary question is, given the trajectory of my interests, would it be more beneficial to complete my degree with a focus in computer science or mathematics if I want to get into data science? I already have a decent understanding of a broad subset of computer sciences, and my programming skills are decent. However there are still enough gaps that I could get a lot out of that type of a specialization, while taking maths on the side.

Or would it be better to focus on the mathematics needed for a data science discipline, given that I have a decent amount of practical, real-world comp sci experience?

Resume check - Problems finding a job w/ a masters,13,8,False,False,False,datascience,1504041770,True,"Hi guys.

I was hoping that I could maybe get some advice on my resume. I recently changed it up as to show more of my experience that I had than the last format (this wastes less space). However, I was hoping that someone could check this to see what they think?

In the experience list, the first and last are positions I held and got paid for. For example, the first was while I was a graduate student at the University of Utah, while the last experience was from when I was a research assistant at Florida State University.

Does anyone have any recommendations on things that I should maybe change and what types of jobs I should be looking at? Because I haven't been getting calls back at all. And it's incredibly frustrating.

Value of AWS certifications for Data Scientists,7,6,False,False,False,datascience,1504049812,True,"Hi all, 

For a background on myself, I have undergrad degrees in Economics and in Business Admin (Finance concentration), and I recently received a graduate degree in Statistics (data science concentration) from what is considered a very good graduate school. With that said, their data science concentration was not great in my opinion, as it was focused too much on engineering / mathematics / statistical theory than it was on applicable data science skills. As a result, while I am fairly good at statistical computing / ML / R coding, I have gaps elsewhere in my knowledge (cloud computing, database management, etc.).

As I work part-time, I'm trying to fill the holes in my data science background. I figure getting one of the AWS certifications (certified solutions architect associate is the certification  I'd be leaning towards) couldn't hurt, but I'm also not sure if it's worth my time. I would love to hear from any full-time data scientists what their thoughts are on a certification like this, or on having a strong background in AWS in general.

Automated theme naming in text analysis?,2,3,False,False,False,datascience,1504051266,True,"Say you have a huge body of news articles and you're tasked with finding patterns in these articles. As opposed to reading through each news article and trying to place it in a ""theme bucket,"" you choose to use topic modeling or some other clustering algorithm.

But wait! Those algorithms only kick out labels in the form of numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ..., *k*). You don't want to read through all of those clusters and try to ""put a name to a theme,"" do you?

**How would you go about automatically naming these clusters/themes?**

1. Finding the most informative features (words) for each cluster
2. Finding the most frequently-occurring words in each cluster

So for one user my numbers might be 12000,14000,13000,18000,12000,12000.

I would like to suggest to each person that they search for jobs in a range. For example, range 11000-18000.

When I make a recommendation to a person, I know if they accepted the recommendation or not. Maybe 10% of users accept the recommendation. 

Now I want to make the recommendation that's most likely to be accepted. For example, with the above sequence I gave, maybe range 11000-18000 wasn't accepted but 11000-19000 *was*. This should incur a reward so that I'm more likely to recommend 11000-19000 in the future.

So far I have two ideas:

1. Take a few stats such as number of values, mean, median, range, 25th and 75th percentiles, etc of the distribution, and train a regression model.

2. Use a kind of neural network in Keras that can take multiple numeric inputs and outputs two values.

It also sounds like this is a problem for reinforcement learning.

Can anybody suggest how best to tackle this problem, and which model and software package would be good to look at first? Thanks!"

[Advice] Self Organising Maps with High Dimensional Data,9,3,False,False,False,datascience,1504101739,True,"I am concerned about using kohonen self-organising maps to analyse some large highly dimensional datasets (n = ~400,000 dim= &gt;11) obtained from flow cytometry experiments, specifically the use of the euclidean distance metric to train the SOM and determine node membership. Am I wrong in thinking that the use of euclidean distance when dimensions exceed 3 will give spurious results, would the mahalanobis or jenson-shannon metric be more appropriate?

As a second question, would it be appropriate/valid to first reduce dimensionality to 2 or 3 using tSNE or diffusion mapping and then train the SOM on the dimensionally reduced data space?

Edit: the data isn't sparse and the reason I'm looking at SOM is that it runs faster and scales better with less need for tweaking parameters than other methods (diffusion maps, density clustering, tsne). "

University - Joining organisations to help career,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1504131513,True,"So on monday I, as many others, will start my first year at a research University for my BSc Economics and Business Economics degree with a specialisation in information management and data science (lots of electives to create this path for myself)

I have always been very interested in programming and somehow ended up in data science by learning python and R by myself besides school. As for this, I will continue learning by myself and developing a better understanding of data science from an economic/financial point of view.

My question is though, I see many of my classmates and career hungry old classmates joining these serious and not so serious student organisations, such as something similar to a Debate club, the United nations student association etc. 

And it made me wonder if this is really that important if I consider myself to be more of a person to learn actual skills such as coding and maths instead of organising a party or event.

So do any of you who already finished their studies in any similar field, find having experience in a student organisation giving their job/career opportunities a real boost even if you are already very skilled in computer skills and maths. 

Because I don't want to sound as a special snowflake or anything, but it seems to me that people are only joining these organisations to get their daily doses of social confirmation and unity, which I don't really feel like needing. 

So it would be great if any of you could confirm my thoughts or point me to the aspects that I am perhaps missing right now! 

Also, I don't have any friends or family in my close circles who went to university so it is hard for me to make conclusions out of this by myself.

TL;DR

Does experience in a student organisation of any kind, boost your career opportunities? or should I be more focussed on becoming a well skilled person in programming/maths/ data science as those aren't really things you can get out of a study organisation."
Data Science at Facebook - not what it once was?,1,3,False,False,False,datascience,1504132594,True,"I'm thinking about applying/interviewing for Facebook's New Grad Data Scientist position.

Aspiring Data Scientist with a background in Structural Engineering | Help me Reddit!,6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1504144612,True,"Hello wonderful people of the data science subreddit! 

In short, I want to become a data scientist. I have two degrees in engineering (BSE in Civil, MSE in Materials/Structural), have worked at two engineering firms in the past, and have just recently signed off as the CTO for a funded ed-tech startup. 

I graduated with my masters mid 2016, and only a month after graduation, I quit my job as a structural engineer (I was there for little over a year) to become the CTO/technical lead for an ed-tech startup. I figured I'd be a great fit, as I gained experience programming and general engineering know-how throughout my previous two jobs and schooling. I'd say my main accomplishments was that I oversaw the creation of a SaaS online product, managed to get the companies financials in check, and created some IP algorithms for use in acquisition of clientele.

While at the startup, I primarily did data visualization and modeling for several clients in terms of projections, growth analysis, and market research. I compiled data from several resources across multiple states, which is quite a pain when you're talking about preK-12 school data, analyzed it using Excel, and created some sound reports for my clients. I also did some good work in the financials department, creating projections and discovering trends to help aid in business strategy. 

I also have experience coding in both computational programming languages (C, MatLab, Python) and web-based programming (JS, CSS, HTML5 etc.)

**Why do I want to be a data scientist now?** I don't know, I guess I just like data, and unearthing something that may be there, hidden among a sea of numbers. I like to sanitize and organize, and find things that could tell a story. I also absolutely love programming. I truly believe I have the basic skills to become a data scientist, yet I am not confident I know what it is that I should be pursuing in terms of the technologies of today. *What programming languages should I know? What is an absolute must among any great data scientist? What am I totally not understanding right about the science? What can I do today to get me on the path of becoming a data scientist?*

I have only been on this sub for maybe 10 minutes, I'll admit, and immediately I saw what looked like great references to some good reads. But I wanted to take this time to introduce myself, and let known my desire to be a data scientist. In essence, what I am really asking is, what must I know now so that I can begin my journey?

"New bachelor's degree, postgrad diploma, or should I just give a new job a go?",15,3,False,False,False,datascience,1504183808,True,"I want to ask you for your guys' advice on what path of study I should take next year.

Bit of background - I spent three years studying a BSc in Pharmacology but I've ended up working in Consulting within HR for the last two years (yeah, I don't really know what it is that I do either...). 

The one thing I've really enjoyed is doing some manipulating, analysing and reporting of data (albeit extremely low-level). These were mostly done in Excel. So I've been thinking all year and I have decided that I want to do **something** data-related. But because my study background is in Pharmacology and work experience is around Consulting/HR I really don't have any of the technical or transferable knowledge that other non-data professions have. For example, I've seen others here who come from a Mechanical Engineering background but they've done programming in C, Matlab, Python etc. 

The options I see for myself:

* Study a new bachelor's around data science. [There's a new University of Auckland Bachelor of Science in Data Science degree that started in 2017](http://www.science.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/subjects-and-specialisations/ug-majors/data-science.html) that I am thinking of taking starting next year. It seems to focus down Stats and Computer Science. R, Python, SAS, analytics and machine learning seem to be the gist of it. But studying this would mean investing 2.5~3 years and I will be 25/6 years old by the time I graduate.

* Study a Postgraduate Diploma in Statistics. This is just mainly a statistics PostGrad diploma. But being only a one year course, I doubt I will cover many topics in as much depth as the bachelor's.

* Give entry-level roles in data analytics or business intelligence (if I am even employable without some formal degree). Willing to start off doing basic querying, analysis and reporting, and learn more on the job.

* Also, online courses. But they seem risky as I don't know if employers will recognise them. Online courses seem to be recognised and popular in the US, but they still seem fringe in New Zealand. (any NZers able to chime in on this?)

So what do you guys think is the best option for me? I would like to study a whole bachelor's degree, but do you think there is some other method of compromise or a happy middle?

If I worked there for a few years, what potential career opportunities might be available to me that offer a mid-career salary over $90k? I am starting my career a little late (almost 30) and would like to be able to retire, which is part of the reason actuarial science was interesting to me.

To be clear, I love statistics and modeling. This kind of work is intrinsically interesting to me, so it's not just money, but I am motivated to be able to buy a home and have enough savings to retire comfortably before I'm 70."

Common Question,3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1504214953,True,"I've looked at many posts of people asking a similar question to what I'm about to ask, but I wanted to get an answer more tailored to myself. I was going to start applying to graduate schools for a Masters in DS, but after doing my research, I find myself really doubting that decision because as many people have said, many schools' DS programs are really new and fluffed. I am about graduate with a bachelors in Statistics. I'm comfortable working with C++, R Studio and I'm learning Python and SQL right now. After looking at many posts, I'm wondering if it would be a smarter decision to not go to graduate school, but try to get a job or internship as a Data Analyst instead and work my way up.

Career advice: Where do i go next in data science?,1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1504295326,True,"**Background** I have a masters in economics and statistics.  Im a Sr. Data Analyst with 6 years of experience.  The first 3 as a financial analyst.

**Skillset**:  I am extremely strong in financial modeling.  I have strong skills in SAS, R, and python.  I am good at data visualization knowing d3js and Tableau.

**Weaknesses**:  While I can do most things in SAS, R, and python.  I have limited experience in applying them in a work place setting.  When I apply them towards datascience, I more or less read how to do a technique and then try to apply it to a work problem.  Basically, I hhave a gap in actually applying statistics in a work place setting.   

Additionally, Im prone to mistakes when I get into massive data pulls/aggregations.  However, normally I do this ad hoc,  and on extremely quiick time frames for one off analysis.  But, I am no data architect.

I am personable and give good presentations. My networking skills lack.

**Current Role** I have been at the company for 2.5 years.  I started in FP&amp;A doing financial planning and was promoted to a Sr. Data Analyst at the Year mark. At the 18 month mark,  I was given a 6 percent raise in my current role.  Alot of people on my team got promoted around this time, so it could of been to not upset me that I didnt get promoted.  In the past two months, I got moved from reporting to my old manager to directly reporting to the VP. I have built a much stronger rapport with my current manger than my previous.  My previous gave me a good review, but it was just an akward relationship where he never really spoke to me.

 I make 95k a year in a large city just outside the top 10 in the US.

My work consist of churn modeling, identifying customers for targeted marketing/sales campaigns, and financial modeling.

** Pros of my position**  I report directly into the VP of our department.  I do alot of ad hoc firedrill financial modeling request for him that gives me alot of visibility inside the company.  Basically, on the org chart im on par with people 4 levels above me.  All my coworkers who were Sr. Analyst and were promoted to a manager are 3 Direct reports away from the VP.  This is good for me as i interact with sr management on a regular basis.

Also pros, the VP has a passion for data and would allow me to try out any data science technique i wanted.  He encourages this actually. so i have an opportunity to get alot of experience using stats and data sceience at a large company.   

**Cons**
The only cons for me are  ego related. For other people, they woudl hate the hours.  I have fire drill weeks where i do put in 80 hours a week in the office and nearly no one else in our department has that.  But, I dont mind because i feel like thats why i have the responsibilities i do and report directly into the vp to have those big responsibilites.  I dont have kids or a relationship and dont party. so this isnt really that big of a deal to me.

For me, I dont like how my job title isnt in line with the org chart.  There are many people with less experience than I do, with the next level in job title.  Some are fresh out of school.  I could make more then them for all i know, but I guess i just dislike having the lowest job title in the room all the time even when people are 4-5 years younger.

**Next STep**

I think i more or less will have to ask for a promotion to get one.  I think thats why others have gotten promoted so fast despite having less responsibilities and worse reviews to the point some got let go after being promoted.

So, if i go in and talk to my boss who is pretty high up at the company. I have to have an idea of what I want my next step of my career to be.

I hate reporting. I hate data architetct type work.  I enjoy financial modeling and data analysis that is used for presentations. meaning just not one off ad hoc bs. I like giving presentations.

Also, in my freetime, I love learning datasceince and programming.

I think my dream job would be one of these consultants that comes into a company, looks over their data and helps on the strategy front.  Alot of the consultants that my companies have hired that do this, more or less just copy my work and analysis into powerpoints anyways.

**Question**

1. Would you bring up wanting to be promoted to my boss?  On one hand, my company promotes quickly.  A few people on my team have gone from Analyst to sr. analyst, to the next level up from Sr. Analyst in a single year.  I have way more responsibilites then those people.  And when we had our annual reduction in force, 2 got let go.  So, I feel like its not too early for me to ask for a promotion. But, on the other hand, at OTHER companies, the time i have been in my current role is pretty short and it would be considered fast to promote me.

2.  What skills do i need to learn to make me more invaluable/increase my earning potential in the work force? Id prefer to stay away from Big Data Architect type of work.

3.  What are some responsibilities that I could ask for that would help progress my career/skillset?  I dont have to ask for a flat out promotion, I could just ask for responsibilities that I want to work towards having.

Another example, I have ""Handbook of Mathematical Functions"" by Abramowitz and Stegun. This covers a huge number of special functions, various tables of function values, and analytical techniques for solving families of equations.

I am curious if references exist more on the algorithmic front that are similar? 

I'd be particularly interesting in encoding information, numerical techniques for optimization, graph algorithms, statistical algorithms, etc. 

However with applications or motivation for why/when a particular technique is used.

I suppose a lot of that would fall into some hypothetical ""Dictionary of Machine Learning"", but I'm curious what exists out there in general.

Thanks in advance."

My Experience as a Data Analyst Intern,27,74,False,False,False,datascience,1504753657,True,"**About Me**

I am currently a candidate for a MSc in Data Science. I started the program today and it is a two-year program.

This past summer I was hired as a Data Analyst Intern at a startup. Although I was not officially Data Scientist Intern, I did do some machine learning while on the job and implemented algorithms at various points. I don't think there is much difference between a Data Analyst Internship and a Data Scientist Internship **within a tech startup**. I do not know how data analyst interns operate in accounting firms, banks, etc.

**The Interview**

After a phone screening, I was invited to interview at the office. The first part was a behavioral interview with the Data Team Lead. The second part was a technical interview with the Data Scientist. 

Q1: Explain one of your projects on your resume to me as if I am a client.

A: The best way to answer this question is to be as vague as possible. Clients/non-engineering members don't care about the algorithm you used or the results of the confusion matrix. What they do care about is how these results will affect their profits or their company in general. Don't talk about the decision tree implementation, talk about how the significant factors you found that led to the classification of the predicted value.

Q2: Design a retail/book/grocery store relational database

A2: Basically you want a table of all the transactions, the items and their prices, customers, each with keys that can join to the other table. I was also asked to limit the tables, join the tables, order a table and group by a table. We ran out of time, but the next part was CTEs.

**The Internship**

As an intern I was asked to do a variety of things. However, my most used skill while at my internship was web-scraping. I developed scripts to scrape websites for a variety of information needed to make the company's current information more useful. If you do not know how to web scrape, I highly suggest you learn it. I personally use BeautifulSoup.

The data team was very small so I had the opportunity to work on all types of projects, including working with PDF and free text data. Therefore, I also learned how to work with unstructured data. This is a pretty daunting task and if you ever end up having to work with this form of data, I highly recommend keeping your bosses in the loop. I didn't and finished it with only a day to spare which was not ideal. 

I also worked with the data scientist to productionalize and augment the current models. While the data scientist worked on more pressing matters, I was testing different algorithms and examining outputs in forms such as confusion matrices, lift charts, AUC curves, etc. 

**Conclusion**
Overall, I found this experience enjoyable. Although working at big 4 companies is ideal, I think working at start ups in big cities like New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, etc. is also super valuable. Being on a small team gave me some more responsibility than an intern would get and although none of the work I did was critical, it still provided value and left me in good terms with the employer.

If there was anything anyone else wanted to know that won't remove the anonymity of the company. Please ask. I saw some questions about people asking about data science internships an I wanted to give my two cents about my own ""data science"" internship.

Evaluating search engine ranking (x post from machinelearning),0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1504775512,True,"Hi

I have a search engine where users search by multiple fields (some text, some numerical). It is a custom domain (it's job board, however which domain itself is not important for my question).

I have logged searches, clicks and views from the current search algorithm as deployed in the wild.

I would like to develop a gold standard for evaluating my search engine, so that when I make an improvement I can score it.

One way is to get lots of human guinea pigs to manually annotate and score lots of rankings.

However I am wondering if there's a reliable technique to do this just from the click logs? Would this be less effective? I'd appreciate some pointers towards which algorithm is currently the best/state of the art to use? For example Wikipedia lists about 7 evaluation measures, I have no idea which is the best one, and if they are applicable to data derived from implicit feedback rather than the human guinea pig approach.

Commercial IT Question (Benchmarking and Analytics),0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1504806865,True,"Hey guys!

I'm working on a data analytics problem, and I need some advice - I'd like to track increases in employee productivity as it correlates to investments in high-performance hardware. For example, I'd like to know the improvements in specific task completion times as a result of jumping from an older PC built around a Pentium D (with hardware like 2GB DDR2 memory, 5400rpm HDDs, etc.) to one built around a 7th-gen Core i5 (8GB DDR4, SATA SSDs, etc.). 

I personally understand that these increases are incredibly dramatic, but I need a way to quantify that in percentages so that I can explain it to the average person. I have access to test PCs of each type, and I can gather user statistics, I just need a workable method to gather the data I'm looking for.

Essentially, I'm looking for a way to evaluate a specific program to see how it utilizes specific hardware. If I can get data such as Task X takes 6:32 (392 seconds) to complete on PC 1 and 3:46 (226 seconds) to complete on PC 2, that would be the perfect type of result. This way I can calculate, for example, that PC 2 offers an X% increase in productivity for Task X, and then I can calculate cost-per-hour savings for particular equipment setups, and make effective recommendations on hardware investments within my company. 

Also, if anyone has any other recommendations that might be helpful in this pursuit, please feel free to share!

Need helping choosing software for model at work!,10,1,False,False,False,datascience,1504923683,True,"Hello all!


I was hoping you guys/girls could give me some information on my best paths if I wanted to create a complicated simulation/model to handle some analysis and problems at work. I started the build in excel and notice some of my colleagues doubting the long-term capability of the model. I was considering writing it in VBA so that it could handle calculations that way without needing RAM to hold all the equations/information at once. However, I believe it would probably be better to build it in more specialized software.


**What I want it to do sorted by priority:**

-Create deep decision trees to handle different tasks.

-Calculate a number of a metrics that would provide us information.

-Dynamically (hopefully quickly) swap data sets out in order to see results for different projects.

-Handle long-form logic of different natures.

-Create visualizations of data, perhaps exportable.

-Handle large amounts of information. (Millions of cells in excel, many of them equations. Equations are repeated a number of times, likely would only need one that iterates downward.)

-A wide variety of modeling assumptions.

-Be easy to use/view/derive information from! (For end users.)


**Secondary/Long-term Objectives**

--Switch Decision tree over to a neural-net/machine learning platform for better decisions.

--Simulate a larger market with a number of inputs.

--Monte Carlo type simulation. (I assume there's likely more advanced forms I don't know about.)


**Bonus Objectives:**

---Software that is affordable/free.



**Additional Info:**

----I know some programming. Not much, but I understand the type of logic and believe I solve problems in a fashion suitable to programming.

----My job already has tableau. Not entirely sure what that handles but I know it's at least a visualization tool.

"Interested in joining Data Science field, but currently have no work experience in the field and unsure of how to jump in.",9,15,False,False,False,datascience,1505064535,True,"I graduated from college in 2016 with a degree in applied mathematics. I did take courses in math programming, statistics, and linear algebra, so I believe I have a good starting-off point.

I am interested in this online M.S. Data Analytics program from Western Governors University. But I am wary of spending money for a degree that recruiters and hiring officers do not care for. As far as I understand from this subreddit, Masters programs for data science are relatively new so none of them have really much weight to their name.

However, through the M.S. program at WGU, students will study for and complete these certifications :  
Oracle Database SQL (1Z0-071)  
SAS Certified Base Programmer for SAS 9 Credential  
SAS Certified Statistical Business Analyst Using SAS 9

Additionally, the program has courses in Statistics for Data Analysis, advanced SQL, data science techniques, etc. Info about the masters program is [here](https://www.wgu.edu/online_it_degrees/data_analytics_master_degree#).  

Something that really attracted me to this program is the fact that if I finish my degree in 24 months it will cost me $12,000. Costs even less if I take less time to finish the program. So it is incredibly affordable.

So based on that, I think the WGU program is pretty solid. But like I said, I don't work in the data science field, and I have no idea what is actually important.

I have a full time job in a completely different field. Online courses are my only option. I plan to leave my job in 2019. Is the Masters program from WGU a good thing to invest in if I am hoping to become a data scientist? What else can I be doing over the next couple of years to increase my chances of getting a job in the field?"

An Applied Data Science Example,3,7,False,False,False,datascience,1505120384,True,"Hi,

I work professionally and have a great interest in Data Science. I have been thinking about going ahead and making the step to  apply it at my workplace. Though I have been reading up on the profession, there are a few things about the field (in particular Big Data processing) that I am unclear about. What I would be curious about is setting it in an applied example that might take place at my workplace to really visualize how it works in practice, and perhaps to even help make a business case at my company.

A big example at my workplace would be predicting churn across our subscription products. We have a great deal of clickstream and usage data that we gather through Adobe Analytics, standard marketing data, and specialized customer insight data that tell us about their interests. I imagine with this type of data we could tell a great deal about whether a customer will cancel in the coming year.

With that in mind, perhaps you could help me with the following questions:

1. **Collecting data**
What type of data beyond what I have already mentioned would be most useful for a churn model? What are the most common sources one draws from?

2. **Data Processing**
When are big data techniques (Spark etc) for a model such as I've mentioned appropriate? We do generate a fair amount of data - I am told the clickstream data generates a TB a day. However Adobe Analytics seems to alleviate the need to look into the raw data as it summarizes the data into the metrics you are looking for already. What is the level of expertise a Data Scientist would need with Big Data techniques? Would it be enough to draw data from the clusters, or would there be more required than that?

3. **Data cleaning**
What is the type of data wrangling that would be needed for a churn model? And how would one do feature engineering? There are a great deal of variables to choose from, and I imagine a lot of metrics might be correlated - how would one account for this?

4. **Modeling**
What are the most appropriate models for a churn analysis? Some products are bigger than others, so what models might be best for large datasets and what for smaller? What models perform better for rare outcomes (for example, if you were looking to predict rare upsell opportunities?)

5. **Deployment**
What is the level of proficiency a typical Data Scientist would have with platforms such as AWS? How we do it at our company is the data architect does all that work - is that a typical interaction for a Data Scientist, or would they typically be required to know more?

6. **Maintenance**
We already maintain dashboards on a quarterly basis for senior management. I imagine an effort like this would follow the same process - ie. we would update our churn and other predictions every three months. Is this a trivial process, or is there a lot to think about here? Would this require to update the models constantly as new data becomes available? How is this possible - would you need a new training set?

Thankyou in advance for your help!"

Historian looking for help on how to organize marriages/baptisms data for analysis on dedicated software,4,2,False,False,False,datascience,1505173990,True,"Hello, my friends! As the title says, I am a historian who has stumbled upon a pretty much complete list of all Anglican people married/baptized in a city throughout the 19th century. 

The problem is that the person who transcribed the information (manually, as most historian work is), transcribed it in a way that is really good for people to read, but bad to do analysis/visualizations.

Any given entry on baptisms might look like this: 


Date of baptism | SURNAME, Name | Date of birth | Name of Father and Mother | Additional Comment (Usually origin of parents, but additional comments may exist) 
---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1819/10/03 | CAMERON, Elizabeth | 1816/12/27 | John/Elizabeth Cameron | Belfast/Ireland


While marriages come organized as 

Date | SURNAME, Name of Groom | Origin of Groom | SURNAME, Name of bride | Origin of Bride
----|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------

Now, even untrained me can catch that there is splittable data going on there and there is no explicit indication of a relationship between elements in order to create edges on a network graph. 

My question to you guys is how could I clean/organize that data in order to make some proper analysis. While I am sure that with my sample size (about 900 marriages throughout the century and no more than 20 every year) I could not do heavy graph theory on it, but maybe I could do some cool visualizations in order to extract better conclusions from it. 

At this point, my feeling from reading the source is that 1) over time, the british community had a high rate of loss of its members to the cultural (and religious) context of Brazilian society. I kinda see that because of the low number of children baptized that actually got married in the same place some years later. Obviously there might be some confounding factors such as emigration, but I would want to test it.

2) There are familiar alliances between sections of the british society based up on engagement or not on the African Slave Trade. I can compare the names with the economical activity in other places, but currently I have no way to actually visualize if such alliances exist in a bigger scale.

PS: I have access to Tableau, could dabble in R, the data is in Excel format.

Any help would be very much welcome!"

Data Analyst- One Month In,18,100,False,False,False,datascience,1505226731,True,"Hi everyone, 

I browse this subreddit quite a bit. Actually it is the first thing I do when I get to work in the morning. I see a lot of posts about data analyst positions and I thought I would share my current experience one month in. 

A little about myself: I graduated from a very good small liberal arts school not super well known for its science and math programs. But I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math. My math minor which included probability models, applied statistics in R, mathematical statistics (proofs of t-test and other things you never want to prove like the Rao-Blackwell theorem), and bayesian statistics with R. I chose work over grad-school because I was unsure exactly what field I wanted to go into and did not want to spend money on a degree that would not further my career. I think the biggest thing that set me apart when I was interviewing was my demonstration that I can learn on my own. Personal projects were something that interviewers were very curious about and I was happy to show them a web-scrapper I built or a website with MySQL developed in django. 

A little bit about my job: I work as a marketing analyst for a natural gas company trying to bring insight into different strategies and predict a variety of different things. This means I do all the sexy things like cleaning data, cleaning data, and cleaning data. I currently use python and R for a lot of my data manipulation. Our company actual uses PowerBI for visualization and reports and it is horribly slow, but very free. Coming out of undergrad I was excited to dive right into applied machine learning algorithms and tried to learn as much as I can about that. But, I think the most important thing is curiosity and wanting to learn about the actual business itself. It is impossible to be a good data analyst if you don't know why the data is being presented to you the way it is. In order to answer interesting questions, you first need to be able to ask them and that all starts with playing with the data and visualizations (EDA!!), not just throwing a random forest regression, SVM, or naive bayes algorithm from scikit-learn. 

Overall it has been a great experience. My math training has been the most useful to me so far, SQL skills have been slowly improving, and I have yet to use any bayesian tricks which I thought was the coolest thing I have every learned, except for solid state physics. 
 
Please pm with questions, I am happy to share my resume. I just recently went through this process and would be happy to talk about my interview experience and all the times I had to fail in order to get the job I have today. Learn how to make reports and try to enjoy it because it is going to be a big part of being a data analyst.

Today I got accepted into a data science bootcamp (roughly 3 months intensive) with an 85% scholarship because of a project I submitted.

I'm currently unemployed, with some options on the horizon, so no major loss ito leaving a job to do this. Even only paying 15%, it's still expensive, plus living costs in a new city for 3 months.
Has anyone had an experience with bootcamps? Is it worth the ""in-depth"" nature (as much as you can in 3 months), as opposed to learning the same thing part time?
I know I can get the right profile for data work with some self-study projects. It's more about time and cost. Even online courses to make up a ""bootcamp"" seem to cost a similar amount when put together. I worry about the quality vs in-person checking and continuous project work.

-What course would you suggest next? CS231N? Andrew Ng's DL courses?
-What is the requisite maths to be comfortable in RNN's? I am certainly lacking in my formal maths education.
-Anything other advice you believe could help someone in my situation :)

Hello, 

Warning in advance, this is a long post. Trying to be specific/detailed enough to get appropriate/relevant feedback. 

I have a B.B.A degree in Economics and I spent a year working in corporate finance at a Fortune 500 company doing internal financial planning and analysis on the expense side. I found this work to be incredibly dry and unfulfilling. I was an ""analyst"", but my work was very simple and didn't require much analytical thought or decision making of any kind. I'm currently traveling internationally and teaching English to sustain myself. During this time, I'd like to build my skill-set to set myself up for a more fulfilling job/career once I return to the U.S. and ""settle down"". 

I really loved studying economics in school and even considered a PhD in econ, but I do not think I am cut out for a PhD, and also one of the main things that turned me off from econ is how impractical it is and how theoretical it is. Many of the economic models we studied in school have a limited basis in reality and are not practical to the work force. 

I have currently become really interested in data in general and the contrast it has to econ in general in that it is extremely practical and useful for business. (Speaking in broad generalizations, because obviously some empirical econ work/econometrics can in fact be very practical, but anyone who has studied econ seriously knows that it is a field that is by and large overly theoretical and detached from reality. 

I have decided to start self-studying ""data science"" or ""data analytics"". I do not know the exact definitions of these terms and am using them very loosely, but I basically mean I am studying statistics, data analysis, python, r, sql, data visualization, etc. I do not have a background in coding or computer science, but have done some self study in coding. I am by no means very knowledgeable with algorithms or modeling. My math background is also quite limited. I have studied through Calculus 1. 

My ultimate goal is to find a career that involves analysis/presentation of data in a way that is:

1) Meaningful/useful 

2) Fulfilling/satisfying (My job crunching basic expense numbers and reporting them up the chain of command to operations managers or higher level finance people was mind numbingly boring and unsatisfying. 

I am aware that many ""data science"" positions involve a lot of tedious work such as compiling and cleaning data, but as long as it has an end result that requires some analytical thought and analysis and has some fulfilling end product such as a useful and eloquent visualization or chart (or once more experienced - useful predictive model) then I will ultimately be fulfilled I believe. 

I know that I am at a disadvantage by not having a hard stem background or an advanced degree. I am open to the possibility of a masters degree. I would probably try to aim for a stats, data science, analytics, or possible CS masters, although I probably do not have the required pre-reqs for most programs. I did have a strong undergrad GPA in Econ. 

At the moment, my current plan is to self-study as much as possible and learn the basics that are valuable to an employer and could get me in the door in a data analytics type position. 

I am starting with a course called ""Data Science A-Z"" on Udemy based on this recommendation: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e

I am also re-working through a free intro to stats textbook to brush up on my statistics. Although it is all review since I took two Stats classes at University. 

I plan to learn some Python or R for data science next and begin to work on projects and keep tackling things such as SQL, linear algebra, brush up on calculus, etc, etc. 

Here are my questions for the people on this subreddit:

1. Am I on the right track with my self-study plan? Any suggestions/feedback?

2. How realistic is my ultimate goal/career plan? What are my possible end results based on my current educational background and self-study plan?

3. Should I pursue a masters degree and if so what degree? (I'm very opposed to paying thousands or tens of thousands for a degree unless the ROI is worth it.)

4. Will I forever be limited/relegated to basic data analytics positions with my non math/stats/CS formal background and no advanced degree? 

Please do not be afraid to be harsh or blunt with your feedback. I'm looking for realistic/pragmatic answers and advice based on my specific background. 

**TL;DR: Looking for helpful feedback regarding my specific personal situation. Thanks!**

I have a wealth of experience in analysing data - from R to Process Mining - but very little hard coding knowledge.  Therefore, I can visualise how the data would need to be laid out to develop such a search engine, but lack the knowledge of what tools/code that would be required.

Just Finished Coursera's ML Class | Next Steps,21,44,False,False,False,datascience,1505601191,True,"Hey all,

As per one user's great advice from [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6x3z1y/aspiring_data_scientist_with_a_background_in/) about two weeks ago, I began my journey into ML and data science. I completed Andrew Ng's course on ML and found it extremely interesting. I loved every bit of it. I was on coursera every day, and completed everything in that course. It was very cool to go on Kaggle, read some tutorial kernals, and just find myself noting what the provider should have done differently as per Prof. Ng's advice. I feel like I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of some of the most basic and widely used ML algorithms today, and how to use them properly. 

I'd now like to contribute on Kaggle, but I really do not have the skills to do ML (or really any data science) in Python/R. Though I probably could mash up some code from some popular kernals, I really wouldn't know what I was doing, and so that would be pointless. I've discovered two courses (specializations) that focus [on deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#pricing) / [general data science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python#pricing) using Python, that seem pretty good. At this point, I'd like to learn Python over R.

Has anyone taken these courses? Does anyone have an opinion on what are some good ways to learn Python with data science? Sometimes I think I could be overcomplicating this, but I really don't think it's wise to jump into Kaggle, only to possibly burn myself out because I don't know Python. Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation and can help guide me? Again, I could just jump into the above two courses, but if anyone can help optimize my solution so that I start in a better direction, that would be huge! 

Thanks you, everyone! As it stands, my game plan is to get on Kaggle, build up a portfolio, and use that to help me land a job in the ML realm. I've actually found some interesting jobs that combine both my collegiate background with ML. Pretty neat.

Data originates as the result-sets of various methods of clinical testing *or* as a stream of continuous signals from connected hardware (connected to living things).

Stated broadly, you will have to receive the data, store that data, do (batch) work on that data to turn into meaningful, structured information, then run analyses and lots of statistical/machine learning and modeling on these datasets. You'll want to put the original data in some persistence layer where you can go back and reuse it (as source of truth) if your work elsewhere down the pipeline requires revision, and therefore your data needs reprocessing.

In your dream-setup, what technologies would you use? I'm talking about anything and everything you can think of from the database (influxDB, openTSDB, Druid, HBase?) to the languages you'd use (Julia, Python, R, Go?) and any of the libraries and frameworks you'd bake into your system to handle steps along the way. I imagine we'll be hearing from at least a few people about the wonderful ways in which things like AWS Lambdas can be helpful in a platform like this.

(Hopefully this is the right place to post this. I found no other relevant posts on this sub)

I have a MSc in engineering, followed by 6 months of data science employment (which ended due to funding). I'm having trouble being considered for data science roles due to my non-CS background (I've been told this in multiple interviews, regardless of my portfolio).

Can anyone speak to the job prospects of [Waterloo's MMath Data Science course-work-only specialization](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-graduate-students/overview-degree-programs/master-mathematics-computer-science)*? More specifically, would it be better than say getting advanced analytics experience with one of the big consulting groups (IBM,Delloite...)?

Preconditioning data before clustering,15,3,False,False,False,datascience,1505780697,True,"Hi there-I have a few questions on one of the experiments I'm running. I have a data set with 12 feature variables (10 continuous and  two categorical -which are of interest but not relevant atm). I want to make no prior assumptions and cluster my 20k or so data points into distinct clusters and asses their in cluster variability and cluster to cluster distance (lets start with k means). However-I want to actually visually represent these suckers-and therefore want to do some PCA beforehand. But I'm a little concerned about how PCA will affect my decision boundaries and the variability between clusters and within them. So my questions are:

How common is it that you run pca before a k means cluster algorithm?

What should i keep in mind regarding how pca changes cluster assignment (other than the obvious change of variables which can transform data points in some pretty wonky ways)?

What does the extreme similiarity in the k means clustering and pca algorithms (have read they are almost equivalent up to some constraints) mean in the greater context of the problem?

Thanks!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


(Note: I'll come back and edit the formatting because it's probably terrible)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn’t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&amp;nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master’s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&amp;nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don’t be afraid to switch jobs when you’re bored or it’s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they’re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn’t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it’s always good to mention how much data you’ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don’t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT’s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx’s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn’t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you’re leaning towards the development side.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it’s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won’t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan’s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn’t too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla’s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It’s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn’t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It’s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn’t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford’s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it’s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don’t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they’d like to see my what I do on the side. I’ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I’m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn’t have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you’ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that’s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest…eh. Doesn’t really matter.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- “junior data scientist”, “data scientist”, “senior analytics”, “senior data analyst”, “junior machine learning”, “entry data science”, and so on. When you’re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can’t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you’re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I’ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn’t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


•	What tools I used at work 


•	How have I made processes more efficient at work


•	Anything I’ve automated 


•	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


•	Why the shift from the current job


•	How much I know about their company and how I’d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I’ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn’t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn’t feel complete. I couldn’t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn’t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I’ll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code “worked”, there was likely some test cases I didn’t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn’t follow through.


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you’ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you’ve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You’ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn’t made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn’t prepare for questions they’d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I’d ask them. This did two things: I didn’t obsess about what they’d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they’d ask questions about how I’d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that’s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it’s a way of thinking you’d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you’ll know what you did inside out, so it’s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don’t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:


VP of Data Science – 


•	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn’t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.


•	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it’s what he was thinking too.

•	*How’s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I’d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they’d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

•	*What’s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people


Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they’re working on, what’s the first thing I’d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.


VP tech – 


•	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I’m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

•	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn’t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

•	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that’s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

•	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I’d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

•	*Cool man!*

He probably liked that I wasn’t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.


COO, president – 


•	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.


•	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with “Nothing? Not even selling lemonade?”. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.


•	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won’t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I’m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I’d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I’m all for that. I’m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the “finding meaning” part.


•	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 


•	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn’t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.


Data scientists – 


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.


VP Marketing (first form)- 


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 


•	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn’t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.


•	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.


•	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.


From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn’t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.


CMO – 


•	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.


•	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.


•	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven’t experienced it before so I’d have to learn how to operate within that structure.


•	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I’m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.


•	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.


•	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job


•	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn’t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.


•	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before


•	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it’s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.


•	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn’t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.


After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.


VP Marketing (final form)-


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain’s gears go overdrive.


•	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.


•	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven’t done it in practice. Couldn’t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.


•	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.


•	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng’s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D


•	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I’ve described here- that I felt useless after my master’s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.


I asked him:


•	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


•	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


•	“You’ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I’d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.”


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn’t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like “peace!”


And that was that!


&amp;nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It’s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don’t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don’t let up!


&amp;nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I’ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I’m not a fan of this explanation but I’ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don’t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It’s uncomfortable, you’ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they’ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It’s business. It’s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you’ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I’ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

And that’s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don’t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It’s almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won’t stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn’t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they’re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you’re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You’ll stumble through a lot of material- and that’s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You’ll reach the “aha!” moment when everything clicks and you “get it”. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it’s hard to know where to start and where to go. I’ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you’re lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn’t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You’ll burn out sometimes, and that’s okay! If you’re as driven and passionate as I was, you’ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

Quick Pandas Question - transposing series value counts,9,1,False,False,False,datascience,1505835419,True,"I have a dataframe with a 48 columns, each with the same 4 possible values.

Image dataset for sharing - How to license/make publicly available?,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1505835601,True,"Hi everyone!

I'm generally happy to share for academic/research purposes (and all of my code is on Github anyway), but I'm hesitant because some of the people who have reached out appear to be from ML companies and are interested in my dataset for commercial applications.

An excerpt from a book am reading now: The End of Average. It showcases how considering the average for data sets might be a bad idea.,5,10,False,False,False,datascience,1505891213,True,"I know that &gt;90% of this community might know this as a fact, but still, I felt like sharing this text. It might not be a technical fact related directly to data science, but still a pretty interesting read. In a way it shows how the application of one of the basic concept in statistics needs critical thinking:



*When the Air Force put Daniels to work measuring pilots, Daniels harbored a private conviction about averages that rejected almost a century of military design philosophy. As he sat in the Aero Medical Laboratory measuring hands, legs, waists, and foreheads, he kept asking himself the same question in his head: How many pilots really were average?*

*He decided to find out. Using the size data he had gathered from 4,063 pilots, Daniels calculated the average of the ten physical dimensions believed to be most relevant for design, including height, chest circumference, and sleeve length. These formed the dimensions of the “average pilot,” which Daniels generously defined as someone whose measurements were within the middle 30 percent of the range of values for each dimension. So, for example, even though the precise average height from the data was five foot nine, he defined the height of the “average pilot” as ranging from five seven to five eleven.*

*Next Daniels, compared each individual pilot, one by one, to the average pilot. Before he crunched his numbers, the consensus among his fellow air force researchers was that the vast majority of pilots would be within the average range on most dimensions. After all, these pilots had already been preselected because they appeared to be average sized. (If you were, say, six foot seven, you would never have been recruited in the first place.) The scientists also expected that a sizable number of pilots would be within the average range on all ten dimensions. But even Daniels was stunned when he tabulated the actual number.*


**Zero.**


*Out of 4,063 pilots, not a single airman fit within the average range on all ten dimensions. One pilot might have a longer-than-average arm length, but a shorter-than-average leg length. Another pilot might have a big chest but small hips. Even more astonishing, Daniels discovered that if you picked out just three of the ten dimensions of size—say, neck circumference, thigh circumference, and wrist circumference—less than 3.5 percent of pilots would be average sized on all three dimensions. Daniels’s findings were clear and incontrovertible. There was no such thing as an average pilot. If you’ve designed a cockpit to fit the average pilot, you’ve actually designed it to fit no one.*

Entry Level Job Offer - Help Evaluating,16,2,False,False,False,datascience,1506017188,True,"Hello everyone!

This sub was very helpful in looking over my resume recently and pointing out some things to change. I believe that this helped me to land a job offer recently. Link to the post is as follows: https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6uelis/resume_critique_new_graduate_miscellaneous_career/

Its important to note that is has been only 1 month since I started looking and I have received 3 different offers and am currently finishing the interview process for 3 more companies. This is also my first real job out of college (just graduated from UCLA)!

So an LA media advertising firm made me an offer recently for the position of Junior Business Intelligence Analyst after telling me I didn't have enough experience for their regular Business Intelligence Analyst position, and while I am grateful for the offer, it seems on the low end.

The responsibilities of the role are generally to use SAS and SQL to consolidate data, developing BI dashboards for clients, build machine learning models for forecasting models from time series, testing the effects of marketing campaigns, etc.

The requirements were that I have a degree in Mathematics, Statistics or another quantitative field from a 4-year university, extensive programming experience, particularly in R, Python, and SAS, SQL skills, time series experience, and experience implementing machine learning models particularly on time series. I had all of these requirements on my resume except for SAS experience.

Compensation: 48,000/year (hourly with potential for overtime), average benefits (with 25% matching of up to 4% of 401k contributions)

I only say I think this is low because another offer I received from an insurance company for an assistant underwriter with 48k compensation and similar benefits where the only requirement was that I received a bachelor's degree from a university. The recruiter for this insurance company skirted around this number and even admitted to me that she thought it was low for the skills and experience I bring to the table, at least compared to Silicon Valley. I ultimately decided to not consider the offer since I didn't want to be an insurance underwriter!

Questions:

1. What is the best way to evaluate the offer?
2. Do you think this offer is reasonable based on entry level positions in the field?
3. I am going to graduate school in a year and naturally have not mentioned this to my employer. Do you think this type of work with this media advertising firm is beneficial before I return to school for a MS in Stats?
4. I fully intend to negotiate with them. Money is fortunately not an immediate issue for me. I don't think what they will end up offering is enough to warrant me to not consider the potential of other opportunities I am currently pursuing or continuing to look for another month. Should I still negotiate even if I don't end up wanting to take the final offer?
5. Continue to look?

I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, and I apologize in advance for any naivete on my part. This is all just very new to me!

Thanks for all the help that you can provide me once more!"

"After 7 months, I've finally made a career change into Data Science and Analytics!!!",45,146,False,False,False,datascience,1506024039,True,"A little bit of background... About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  

I started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!

With my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.

Up until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.

After updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  

I quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!  My biggest problem now is deciding what to do if I receive multiple offers but that is definitely a good problem to have.  I would have never thought I would be in this situation but it helps to know that it can happen to anyone so don't give up chasing your passions!

I hope my story can serve as a little bit of inspiration to anyone else out there looking to make a career change, it's never too late!

TL;DR
Bored of my current job, wanted a career change
Took some online courses to learn Python, R, and SQL
Created pretty resume
Applied to every job under the sun
Got a job offer!"

Looking for some help after getting screwed over by a boot camp.,10,1,False,False,False,datascience,1506036280,True,"Hi guys, 

I'll start off by saying I enrolled in a data analysis boot camp with a company that gets rated really well in terms of boot camps. This all started in around May. The class was supposed to start August 15th. It got pushed back and was supposed to start September 25th. So this week I contact them, since they said they would contact me and never did; suddenly they are saying the class is getting pushed back a few months and they're changing the days of the class so that I can not even attend. This was the first I was hearing of any of this and no one even thought to notify me or discuss any of the changes with me. Needless to say I asked for my money back.

So now I'm back at square one. I have a research background (M.S. in marine science) and am very familiar with most advanced math and statistics. I'm just looking for any advice that anyone can give me on how to get into teaching myself the things necessary to get into data analysis since my original plan fell through. I did buy a series of O'reilly books and have been going through them. But I'd be really grateful if anyone could give me some advice; especially maybe anyone that has taught themselves.

Thank you in advance for any advice. "

"At a crossroads in career and life, humbly looking for career advice from the community.",2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1506042331,True,"Ok here goes…I’m an analytical, technical, thirst-for-knowledge, and overall problem solving kind of worker for 10 years now.  I’m very comfortable for data, research, and analysis as I’ve always found those types of projects wherever I’ve been.  Fast forward a few years and a few kids, I’ve decided I’m ready for the official change into Data, whatever that may be as the titles change daily it seems.  The ultimate goal is to be the f*n man that pulls mind-blowing value from data and saves the company millions.

I’ve read some books and taken a few classes on Udemy (SQL, Python, R, MS Access), and it’s obvious I still have a long way to go before achieving strength in all areas.  Although I must say it’s coming along nicely, and most of all I love the process.  This work is energizing.

I’m happy in my current role which is a mix of business analysis, process improvement, and reporting.  Recently I lost an opportunity to join a BI team, and now I’m at a crossroads of deciding the appropriate steps to make this happen.  The rejection was brutal, and I’ve digested it as well as I ever will.  My thoughts have led me to two likely conclusions: it wasn’t meant to be for me in BI/Data at my current company and I need to carve out my own path that ultimately leads to kick-ass Data Analysis/Science albeit circumventing the BI route, or I polish up my skills and prepare to leave the company.  Everything is on the table, and I’m prepared to dedicate my entire existence to this career.  It’s unclear to me what has the most value, or what combination of skills/training/creds will best tee me up for this career.

From my current position I struggle to prioritize the following:

1.	**Online classes out the ass (edX, Udemy, Coursera) and in what order?**  Data Science, BI, Python, R, SQL, UX, Machine Learning, or Visualization (Tableua or Power BI?)
2.	**Formal classes (this is tough, only have one go and we’re talking big $/time commitment)** - MS in Statistics, or MS in any of the new Data Analytics programs OR Certificate in Data Analysis (would prefer just going for the master’s instead)
3.	**Domain Knowledge / Other Certifications** - PMP, Six Sigma, SCRUM, AGILE, any of these worthwhile?

Personally I feel it's either going straight for the master's immediately, or pushing it off and knocking out as many MOOC classes and work projects as I can.  Then knock out the master's to kick it up to the next level.

Risks

1.	Time: I’m not ancient but I’m no recent grad.  Mid-30s.  Having a strong gameplan is critical.
2.	Money: I’m able to purchase one master’s program from a standard school, nothing crazy.

What I’d love from you is any guidance or perspective that will help me prioritize and attack the situation ahead of me.  I've seen the success on this board, and I want some of that action.  I know this field is rapidly evolving and technology will likely kill many tools and processes we use today.  I firmly believe even with loads of new tech in the pipeline its true value is realized when somebody with appropriate training and experience is piloting the mission.  Thanks!

Just checking what methods I should be looking at.  


Have a set of numerical data, after cleaning nulls and bad reads have 500 cols x 90,000 rows, with a nominal setpoint column, plant feed rate and 498 other columns of varying relevance.

nb: The setpoint should result in the plant feedrate, subject to the plant response to 498 other columns of input.

set point is input.  


498 other columns are input (some will be autoresponding to internal signals, ie: pump turns off when tank is empty or full)  

plant feedrate is output.   


Looking at the charts it's reasonably obvious the actual feed rate lags the setpoint by some time period. Shortlisting the high correlation data points also indicates a time lag, the time lag varies with some columns (data is from an industrial process plant and time delays due to retention, transport delays etc between instrumentation on pumps, tanks, conveyors etc is to be expected.

While I have some methods I've used to cater for this, they are crude and custom rolled, also tedious to implement.

I suspect the methods used in share price prediction will be similar, likely other fields have developed similar methods.

Aspiring Data Scientist,10,5,False,False,False,datascience,1506059272,True,"I'm currently attending the University of Florida for a Bachelor's degree in pure mathematics with a GPA of 3.77.

Currently, I'm also studying Algorithms and Complexity Analysis and want to complete a second bachelor's in Statistics over 3 semesters before applying to Data Mining or Computational Statistics Master's. I'm thinking of using the bachelors to study Machine Learning, deep math behind categorical/multivariate methods and programming in C++, R, Python, SQL, Tableau, HADOOP etc over 2 years in addition to the degree.

Then comes a Master's in Data Mining from UCF...or should I shoot for a better school with this background even though I have no income and will be independent after my second bachelor's (commuting from home)?

Why so many Data Science jobs (seem to) require a Masters or Ph.D,20,4,False,False,False,datascience,1506061038,True,"So, I've been noticing that a ton of the Data Science jobs out there usually require a Masters, but preferably Ph.D for the full-fledged Data Scientist title. 
Because it's a very hot field, naturally various boot camps and MOOCs have popped up, all offering courses in DS / ML / AI...but you might ask yourself ""Will the courses teach me what I need, or do I really need to spend 5 - 9 years at some University?""

Well, here are my thoughts (FWIW, I have a Masters in Applied Physics - Machine Learning): 

**1.** Even though many of the techniques are fairly old, the Data Science field itself is pretty young. Because of this, not many (educational) institutes have been offering any official or streamlined program towards DS. Hence why so many applicants come from slightly-related fields, where the same techniques are applied. 

Because of the above, many schools do not offer DS / ML / AI before Graduate School - and even then, you're just scratching the surface. You learn the bare basics, and won't really get to touch the cool or recent stuff before you start on a Ph. D 

This, in effect, creates a very large pool of applicants that hold a Masters or Ph.D 

**2.** The field is expanding rapidly, and some techniques or research areas (Deep Learning, for example) are quite recent. Because of the pace, you really do want applicants that can 

A) Fluently read research papers 

B) Convert ideas from research papers into working code  

C) Potentially own research

Because research papers are written by researchers, for researchers, they are also quite dense to read. In short, you need to know the language (at times advanced Math and Engineering), and you need to know it quite fluently. 

If you're a Ph.D, it's a good indicator that you're excellent at that. Scientists read research papers / literature all day. 

**Notes** 

With that said...DS / ML are hot buzzwords, and many companies deal with quite trivial problems. Many of these jobs can absolutely be done without problem, just by doing short-term self-study, and knowing a bit of this and a bit of that. There are many ""ABC"" study guides floating around here, listing up all the fundamentals. 

However, if you want to work as a scientist / researcher, and want be on the forefront of things / cutting edge, I would advise you to seek a higher education. Whichever way you slice it, you need rigorous experience. 

The **TL;DR** 

- Not many Universities offer stand-alone DS / ML programs, and many of the DS / ML programs are part of a Masters Degree specialization, and then a Ph.D program / research group

- Because of that, many applicants and candidates hold a Masters or Ph.D - So you get a kind of inflation in the Degree level. 

- Research in some areas move fast, so you need to have some researcher skills to keep up - like reading research literature quite seamlessly. Academic (or other) research background will help you at this. 

**End notes** 

I predict that in 10-15 years, there will be more undergrad ""specialized"" jobs in DS or ML, simply because more schools will be offering said undergrad programs. I know that schools all over are doing everything they can to open programs like that, because of the high demand from both industry and students. "

Hi Reddit! I'm turning to you in my hour of need and looking for harsh, cold honesty.

I finished an accelerated Master's program in statistics in May and probably applied to 1,000+ jobs over the summer; changed my resume at least four times, including getting a professional re-write; reached out to tons of people through connections and got internal referrals.

From all of this, I got three call-backs, with eventual rejections. So, at this point, I'm asking if I'm even employable in data analytics.

I am a carreer-switcher, with background in law. My BA was in humanities. But I found myself constantly being put in charge of technical and analytical projects and ended up deciding that data science was a better career for me. 

My Master's program was very intense and I did well. I now know R and Statistics quite well for data munging, analysis, and visualization. I self-taught myself SQL, Python, and now, Tableau. I have many good ""tidy datasets"" projects I showcase on my resume from school and I have exposure to extremely ""un-tidy"" text-based data and business data from my years in law. I have never been an analyst, but I make sure to show that the work I did was mostly analytical, including business analysis in Excel and querying data using legal database management tools.

Obviously, I have a non-traditional background for a data analyst, but with the amount of time I put in, I was hoping to get some interests by now. Recruiters and connections don't reply to me 90% of the time.

I just want to know at this point, is this a lost cause? Should I give up and go back to law? I like data science and I can lead a project from data ingest to conclusion to get insights. I have a scientific mind that's just rotting away in an administrative role. So, it would suck to give up. But I have loans that are due and no health insurance and I need to get real. So, get real with me, reddit. Any advice, tips for open positions, and harsh realities are appreciated."

Now, I've been slowly self learning and over the past year and I've managed to teach myself some Python and R, but I'm still missing out on other things like SQL,Tableau,etc. I figured that with enough time and practice I can get a hang of the programming aspect of DS. But it's been very difficult for me to learn HOW to actually understand, interpret and analyze the data I am working with. And for that I strongly believe that I would need the guidance of a teacher. That's why I've been strongly considering pursuing either a MS in DS or paying for bootcamps.

I live in Chicago and Northwestern university has a great MS program for analytics ( http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/overview/ ) as well as 24 week part time coding bootcamp( https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu ). I strongly believe that both of these programs will give me the skills and guidance I need to get establish a career in DS.(please correct me if this assumption is incorrect)

The way I'm looking at things now is, do the part time bootcamp while working fulltime(its more affordable that way), apply for jobs(hopefully land one successfully), work for a year or two saving up some money, and then apply for the MS in DS.

Is this a good idea or am I just wasting my resources and effort with the bootcamp? Or is there another option I haven't even considered?

Thanks in advance! :)"

Methods for categorical time-series predictions/connecting?,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1506347021,True,"Struggling with a problem and don’t know where to start. I’ve abstracted the problem to a different example to remove the domain knowledge you’d otherwise need to make sense of it (though I might actually be making it worse…).

I have a large data set of people’s actions, which I can supplement with additional information on how those people are connected. Each action has attributes such as person, type, extremity and time of occurrence. So an action might look like “Bill A., Yawn, Loud, Apr 1st 2016 1230”. There are an enormous number (1000+) of different action types and 10's of thousands of different people.

My objective is to identify which actions are connected to each other. So for example if every single time a Father yawns, his daughter yawns too, you might consider that connected. While maybe only 10% of the time when a Mother yawns the son yawns too, these might not be considered related types of events. Or maybe the action of someone raising their voice causes their parents to raise their voices but their children to lower theirs.

Resume and Job Search Advice?,6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1506362455,True,"Hi all,

tl;dr: Recent grad looking for a data analyst position, some interviews but no success. Need advice on strategizing my job search and resume (and maybe interviewing too). Thanks!

(Resume Link: https://imgur.com/a/vM1Fa)

I graduated with an undergrad degree in May with a degree in  Economics and two minors in CS and Stats. I'm aspiring to become a data scientist but I realize that right now I need to find a data analyst job because this is what I'm most qualified for and it would be a good starting point to build my skill set and eventually become a data scientist.

However, up to now I haven't had too much luck with my job search. I get some phone interviews and then a bunch of second or maybe even third round interviews, and I got to the final round of a interview process with a data consultancy once, but nothing has worked out yet and I'm not sure if my hit-rate for hearing back after throwing my resume out there is good enough. I've probably sent out ~200 applications or so but I haven't been customizing cover letters much besides names and minor changes. 

Recently I've been trying to focus more on reaching out to people on linkedin for informational interviews and career advice and I'm working on setting up a personal blog/site to put up small projects on which would act as a portfolio. While I've gotten a lot of good advice from phone calls with data scientist (not to be underestimated), it hasn't really helped me in getting a job in a direct way.

Given my experience through internships and my technical skills, I thought I would have a bit of an easier time finding a data analyst job - I like to think I'm a solid interviewer most of the time too. It's been about 4 months now and I'm starting to feel a bit desperate and at a loss for what I'm doing wrong. Any critiques, advice, or feedback would be much appreciated. 

I also just remade my resume after wondering if my previous resume was putting me in the throwaway pile and I'd love to get some critique (my previous resume was was more unconventional/creative). The resolution may be a little low in the screenshot, it isn't like that in the PDF form.

Hopefully some of this discussion also helps other recent grads in my position who are lurking around here as well. Sorry for the wall of text.

Help point me in the right direction! Calculating likelyhood to buy,19,2,False,False,False,datascience,1506548493,True,"So, I want to calculate the probability a customer will buy a product based on some data that I have.

I have 50 products, and thousands of customers in my data set

Example rules that would make a customer more/less likely

I know if a customer is in an urban market, he is much more likely to buy a certain project.  

I also know product relationships, such as if a customer has product C, then he is likely to buy product D

I also know things like, if a customer ahs 10 or more employees, he will be unlikely to buy one of our products.

**Question**

1) What stats technique can be used to calculate this?  Would i just run 50 logistic regressions?

2)  How do i turn in qualititative knowledge, like if a customer has 10 or more employees, then he will be a very hard sell for Product D. into some type  of data that can be used in my model/regression"

What's a simple and effective way to track how a website impacted software sales (not SAAS but licensed based),0,3,False,False,False,datascience,1506616330,True,"I am a UX designer and I know a little bit of conversion optimization  - I have done A/B testing for landing pages to check and improve conversion optimization for AdWords campaigns at a previous company I worked for.

My challenge now is different. The company is not data-driven at all, marketing does not track the effectiveness of social media, campaigns, emails into business results and I'm NOT on a mission to change the culture, but just to make sure my work is valuable and causes an impact.

I was responsible for redesigning the website for my new company and it was really bad from a content and design perspective (didn't really sell well the strengths of the software). My boss was against tracking results on this website because he feels that people buy this product regardless of the content on the website. It's a desktop software similar to Autocad and people buy because they need for their work, so he feels that people compare the product by talking to coworkers in the industry and buys based on features or what the industry is using. However, I have a hypothesis that the redesign could do some sort of impact in the sales or conversion.

I convinced him that doing a basic tracking to see the impact on sales and conversion would be nice, it would look good for the CEO and business people if we caused a good impact. If nothing good happens it's cool because nobody is expecting these numbers.

This is the process of buying the product:

(homepage or product page) - &gt; (goes to another subsite with online store) - &gt; (login) - &gt; (adds to the cart product version) - &gt; (checkout).

Note: we didn't touch the online store at all which is a separate website

Question: If you don't have a lot of analytical historical data, but just sales data in a spreadsheet, what would be the best way to create a ""Framework"" to analyze the impact?

I know they have google analytics installed on both properties, but they never did the setup properly, with filters and never used any data. I don't like G.A. myself because I've worked in other teams and it's very tricky to match numbers, and again goals with $$ numbers were never created in G.A. anyway, all the sales data is in our CRM.

I was going to install Hotjar and create a simple conversion rate funnel from the website to the final step in the purchase (linking the store with the WordPress website) or maybe some sort of check on sales data to see any spikes.

Any advice?

"Code goes in git, but where does the data go?",28,40,False,False,False,datascience,1506641907,True,"Hi everyone,

How do you manage your projects in a corporate setting where multiple folks collaborate on a single project?  

Where are current doing ""a folder per project"" on a network drive. There, you find the following subfolders :   
  
- a ""data/raw"" subfolder, where we put the raw data, shapefile, etc..  
- a  ""git"" folder for each collaborator  (git-username1, git-username2, etc..)  to clone the repo and work on the code.  That subfolder is built similar to [cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).    The main difference is that we don't put the raw data there, because we don't want to create a copy of the data for each collaborator and we don't want to check it into git.   When we need to refer to the data, we'll refer to ""/../data/raw/""  

there are also some extra folders such as  

- ""mandate"" , where we put what is the goal of this project, who asked for it, what is the delivery date, etc..
- ""litterature"" where we put pdfs from relevant book chapters, articles, blog posts, etc..

This works fine as long as the project is ""on going"".  When we will be done, we will delete all the ""git"" folders and simply leave a URL shortcut to the git repo so that someone can clone the latest version when needed.

If someone needs to take over the project a year from now, they will need two separate places:  
a) git repo for the code  
b) data/raw folder  
  
I feel the code is safe on the internal git repo, but I'm  afraid for the data.  A well intentioned person could move or delete the data folder.    Worse, someone could edit the data without meaning to do it (I'm looking at you excel).  

Also, it is kind of an hassle while sharing projects between teams because we will have to ask IT to provide access to two different places (git AND data) instead of just one.

How do folks do it?  The datascience cookiecutter mentions the following:   
  
- AWS S3 with a syncing tool
- Git large file storage
- Git annex
- Dat

This is corporate data, so we don't want to put it just anywhere. 

thanks

Hoping you can share some insight into what the data science jobs market looks like in Canada.

Specifically, my question is geared more towards **data analytics and modelling** side of things rather than data architecture and management side of things.

• Is the Canadian jobs market similar to that in the US, both in how advanced it is, how competitive the market is?

• What salary vs experience relationship can one expect?

• Same questions as above but compared to the UK

• Are there any specific hubs/cities that have a strong focus towards the industry in Canada?

• Are there any specific industries in data science that people tend to focus on there? Insurance, Finance, Telecoms, Consumer, ... ?

If you have any links/resources you can share on the data market in Canada that could help my search I'd really appreciate them, thanks Reddit.

Moving from BSc in Mathematics to Data Science,6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1506788544,True,"I'm final year Mathematics student in Europe, researching options for Masters programmes.I'm really keen on working in data science as stats as been my focus and really want to learn how to apply it.

 I've done all my modules in pure math, applied math and statistics, and just one module in C/C++ programming. My choices were between stats and physics, I chose stats.

I'm looking at EU as can't afford US. Found several data science courses but they all (understandably) require several modules in computer science, which just weren't an option for me and I cant get them, credited anyway, it seems without doing a bachelor in CS which is overkill for what I need.

Other options seem to just Masters in Statistics but many focus on things like SAS and don't seem to give me knowledge I'm missing in Computer Science. Feel like I will have tons of stats knowledge but no computer science knowledge. Obviuosly can pick up a lot online but feel like companies in Europe really want to see credited qualifications.

So I'm wondering if anyone has been in similar situation? having the math but not the CS? is there a workaround to getting into work as Data Scientist?

Is a Masters in Stats worthwhile if I know i want to go into data science and the masters trains for traditional role in statistics, with no focus on CS needed for data science.

Interview assignment for junior / medior data scientist,15,3,False,False,False,datascience,1506856739,True,"I work for a broadcasting company that recently began setting up big data infrastructure and an accompanying data team. 

As a data engineer I've been tasked with coming up with a reasonable take-home assignment for a data scientist candidate. 

I am aware this should most likely be done by a senior data scientist rather than myself, but it appears to be the case that due to circumstances I am the best man for the job. Hence this question; 

Could you give me any tips or pointers as to how I could create the best possible take-home assignment? 

What I've come up with; 

- Give the candidate a cleaned-up dataset and notebook containing customer activity over an n-week period
- Task the candidate with creating a classifier that predicts wether or not a given user will churn. AKA will this user be a loyal retaining customer over a certain period t, or not (= churn) 
- Ask the candidate to clarify their presented solution, which algorithm(s) they might have used and why. 
- Ask the candidate to determine and list the importance of each feature in the churning model   

What I could use help with; 

- This is a very practical assignment, perhaps little theoretical insight is demonstrated. Should I put more emphasis on the algorithms the candidate might use? SVM, nearest-neighbour, gradient boosting... Perhaps ask for them to make a comparison and choose what they think is the best possible option? 

- I feel I should incorporate a few steps; The first question should be easy, the second of reasonable difficulty and the last one preferably frustratingly hard. Ideally this last one tests the candidates ability to handle hard situations and how they mitigate and communicate them. The perfect answer would be something along the lines of ""I tried to apply approach A, B and C to little avail. I feel that if we want to meet the goal represented in the question, perhaps we should be concerned with ingesting specific data. For example a user's X and Y datapoints would be a good place to start.""

What should I learn to create this system?,2,5,False,False,False,datascience,1506860457,True,"I have been using a manual method to trade crypto currencies for around a years now and it has been giving great returns. The main method involves dividing coin price movement over a long timeframe (one or 2 years) to different phases and ignoring short term noises. Crypto Currencies are traded just like stocks so the system will be similar.

I started learning data science in python for this and other similar purposes last month (I am doing undergraduate in computer science and have strong programming knowledge but my mathematical knowledge is bad (Upto A Level Maths)). I want to create a system for it because it will be faster and it will remove bias and i can experiment other stuffs too. I learned the basics of data science and charting from udemy and now have started doing Machine Learning Courses in coursera and datacamp along with quantopian and financial courses from udemy. Because of my weak mathematical background - i have been doing some extra work on Theoretical Machine Learning courses.

Where should i focus more of my time on to create such a system? I want to complete all these courses but i want to learn enough to create a system like this first if it is possible (Easier to continue learning when you have something for it) Is learning Machine Learning suitable for a task like that (I have done some basics and i am not sure yet)?

I spent the past year doing as many projects as I could and have learned a lot! This past summer, I did research with a professor at my university in data mining. He let me choose my own topic, so I had to do a literature search and everything on my own. Recently, I had my first data science interview for a team that does search. The interviewer told me they're looking to hire someone in 2017 and my timeline is too far out. I understand I don't have the expertise to get into Google Brain, but where should I be looking to get a job in industry? May 2018 is likely too far out for many companies to hire right now, where should I be looking for jobs? Constructive feedback would be appreciated!"
"How do i get into data sciences? (Graduating high school this year, going to university)",10,3,False,False,False,datascience,1506916810,True,"Tl;dr - going to university next year, whats the path i should take to become a data scientist?

Hi, I graduate highschool this year and am quickly growing more and more interested in data science. However im very confused with the path I need to take to work in your field. I have a lot of questions and they're all very jumbled, bare with me please.

-What university majors/programs should I take? Mathematics, statistics, computer science, economics, am i going to need a combined or double major?

-Is it useful to take any buisiness/finance (or even a science like chemistry) as a minor?

-I've seen a couple undergrad Data Science programs, but im skeptical (maybe wrongly so) that it would be too broad or not be as applicable as for example a degree in computer science would be. If i see a program labled data science does it contain everything i need and should i just jump right in?

-Is actuarial science a possible pathway? Is it similar at all to data science?

-Will i need a masters or phd to have success in finding a job? Or will a bachelors do just fine with coop programs/internships being very important?

-I'm likely to go to university in western Canada, ie: UBC, UVIC UofA, UofC, SFU etc... So if anybody has any insight or experience with any of those schools and their programs that would be insanely helpful!

As you can tell im super confused but also very curious, hopefully my rambling hasnt come off as too naive. Anything you can tell me about your experiences, the path I need to take and the credentials I'll need would be so appreciated, thanks so much in advance!"

"R is said to have a higher learning curve, but I've found Python to be far, far more complex for the simplest tasks.",50,59,False,False,False,datascience,1506953483,True,"I always hear people telling me R has a higher learning curve. That's pretty much a signature statement for them. But python is much, much more complex. They have lists, data frames, arrays, tuples, dictionaries, LISTS of dictionaries, and I'm probably missing a bunch of other forms of storing data. For R, it's almost dumbfounding how straightforward it is. You have vectors, and you can still create dataframes. Also, you have the tidyverse, which makes working with data easier than a day at the golf course. 


Much of Python's packages are dramatically more complex as well. Take web scraping. You have to use beautifulsoup/bs4, and then you have to import lxml, and then you parse it with some arbitrarily complex code. On R, you just read_HTML, use rvest to read it in, and you're set. You can literally [scrape a page in R in less than 6 lines! ](https://youtu.be/gSbuwYdNYLM?t=166) They pull an entire table from Calpoly's admissions site, in SIX LINES! [The same operation in Python is quite arbitrary and is a frivolous venture](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/). Look how long this freaking tutorial is, just to scrape the simplest page! What is worse about this example is that rvest will look for ALL tables, in the entire page, and then you just specify what you want. But for python, you have to use a ridiculous for loop to loop over every single table you want. This pretty little example makes it seem like you're going to have a gleaming and wonderful output, which really isn't the case. 

Here is some code for a 'simple' webscraping script for Python I found on the web on the suggestion of an expert Python programmer: 

#########################
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request


from urllib.parse import urlencode



from bs4 import BeautifulSoup



url = 'https://opir.fiu.edu/instructor_evals/instr_eval_result.asp'



data = {'Term':'1171', 'Coll':'%', 'Dept':'','RefNum':'','Crse':'','Instr':''}



r = urlopen(Request(url, data=urlencode(data).encode()))



html = r.read().decode()




soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')




tables = soup.find_all('table')
#########################



Yes, this is SO much simpler than R, especially to a novice who has barely ever programmed (/s)! Plus, the code doesn't work, and results in a nasty error: 


**'UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 5779573: invalid continuation byte'**


Do you really think a novice is going to understand what this is, or how to solve this issue? 



In addition, installing packages or libraries in Python as a beginner is downright infuriating. After installing Python, you have to literally MAP pip to your environment variables on your PC. This took me several hours working on an older machine (I have no control over the OS used on some of the machines I work on), as it wasn't easy to locate, and even when I found it, it simply wouldn't accept the directory without extensive troubleshooting. The alternative isyou can download Anaconda/miniconda, but then, depending on your IDE, you have to go into your settings and choose which interpreter to use... The default, or the anaconda. 

In R, guess what you do? Go to packages, click install, type the package, done. Then you click the checkbox to enable it. No interpreters, no editing environment variables, or spending hours fussing over errors you get with Python. Anyone got wonna dem Staples EASY buttons ?


tl;dr: Everything is more complex in Python. R is the boogeyman to those who haven't put the slightest effort into learning it, but Python involves doing far more work for the same result, with much more frustration **if you are a novice**. I have no doubt that in eight years, after working with Python for years, that I will have a sufficient grasp on it. But as a novice, Python has a lot more to learn than R does. I'm not saying Python is a horrible language, but I am saying that it most certainly isn't as novice/user friendly as it claims, and it's a bit harsh that the data community makes R look like the boogeyman when in reality, it's the friendly neighbor willing to help.

Different roles relative to data science,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1507035654,True,"Hello, I would appreciate some answers from people already working in the field. Thanks for your time.

A bit of background: I graduated as a Civil/Structural Engineer some years ago and spent some time working as an engineer but I realised I never really liked it. I was considering a master's either for expertise in a certain field or for career change but i decided i didn't want/it wasn't worthy. So while i was trying to figure out what i want to work on I started taking small random projects (excel/translations/data entry) on freelancer.com (lol) two of which led to a remote ""position"" in two start ups. 

The first is kind of irrelevant, but the second was a start up developing an AI platform for logo recognition (which they succeeded and they were acquired by a very big company) where i spent almost two years. Initially my role there was ""data entry"" (tagging/annotating logos/videos using their program) then i was kind of in charge of myself and a group of four regarding this data entry (plan how to distribute work to do it faster and meet the strict deadlines) + checking/reporting on the after-training results if they seem logical or odd or any other observation (nothing that needed more than common sense and basic maths understanding) and in the end i was offered to join their QA team. Of course at the time i didn't even know what QA is or does since i was never involved/following the cs or it field, but anyway i suffered from a burnout and had to stop working for a few months. 

So fast forward some months ago, their offer still stood but I was still considering what i want to do and anyway i decided i wanted to be involved with data science. I was researching what and how but nothing seems clear enough. I know that my education isn't enough to be looking to become a data scientist and I never aspired for a big career anyway but I want to work on something relevant. I always had an interest in data and very good understanding of maths and statistics but i never really occupied myself with those other than my studies with the exception of some statistics i was checking myself.


My maths level is typical ce stuff i.e calculus, linear algebra, integrals, matrices, regression etc (it's been years so i dont really remember clearly what ive done) and i know there are more complex stuff i need to catch up but i think it's just time that i need. Regarding coding i almost lack any coding background, which i hate to not know what i don't know, so i started teaching myself python. Of course i know that i don't have fundamental knowledge in cs which makes me feel stupid, I always hated application without knowing the theory. Machine learning, algorithms, neural networks are stuff i also lack almost any real knoweldge. 

In a matter of months i'll be moving to the UK anyway and this is where I need your assistance. I know I can't learn/refresh everything in a few months and don't have yet a clear view on the aspects of data science but also i don't clearly know what my knoweldge should be for a given position. I mean i'm not even sure about what positions exist. From my understanding till now what suits me better is less formal coding more analysis but not too deep in maths yet.

So what i really want from you, judging on the above, is to guide me by telling me what position i should go for and what is needed for that. I know i can ""fake"" these two years as having a proper position eg operations manager or qa if i learn python by then. I think i can focus and learn 2-3 of the following in the given time (i know believing you know and applying it in a real job can be far from each other): python sql visualization maths

Try to learn python by finishing an online course on python for data science and try to experiment with it?
Or instead try SQL?
Try to learn the most out of these or focus on specific tasks? Or instead master VBA excel and study those while working?
Focus on refreshing maths or visualization?
Should i try and fake i know more on these that i already know and work+learn or no?

Using PCA as factor selection technique when Variability and Correlation are the other concerns,6,5,False,False,False,datascience,1507063613,True,"edit:  gang i realized i typod. by other i meant only fml

I would prefer not to just throw in a covariance mateix and select from there.  I’m aware of a good deal of the LA behind PCA why it is not considered a factor selection method-but as pca maximizes variance along a new set of axis closest to the data space-could i use the loadings to select the variables with the highest degree of variance?

A hypothetical example: I call an API to grab all x subreddits from Reddit. Then, for each of these x subreddits, I then call the API again to grab all y posts. Then for each of these y posts, I again call the API to grab all of the z comments.

Given this hypothetical, you can see that you end up with a tree of execution, where each node in the tree can produce n number of additional child nodes, to be processed in parallel.

What I am talking about here is some mix of a web crawler (except more constrained to well understood, but varying APIs) and a batch processor. I need each of these nodes logically separated like this, so that if one fails, it only stops execution for the possible nodes that come after, but not the nodes at it's same level.

I've looked into building this as a set of microservices, using an event bus to schedule jobs for a pool of workers. Then I could record the state of each of these paths, and track when something fails, and be able to debug and retry.

I would love some suggestions for this, or an idea of other projects that look very similar, so that I might gain some inspiration from them.

Thanks!

Edit: I've looking into Airflow and Luigi, but they seem better as proper workflow orchestrators. Perhaps even as the rest of the ETL, once the data has already been aggregated from these various APIs. Another was AWS Batch, but it's not very mature, and the UI stinks. If you disagree with either of these interpretations, by all means, lemme hear why :)"

Got two job offers - which one should I take?,16,5,False,False,False,datascience,1507227816,True,"Hi everyone, 

I have two job offers and I'm having a really difficult time choosing which one (it’s a wonderful predicament to be in).  I'd like to get your opinions on how I should go about making this decision.  I recently graduated with a B.S. in math and I've been wanting to work in machine learning and artificial intelligence.  My dream job in the future would be working on the cutting edge in the fields of data science/ML/AI, in a large tech company like FB, Spotify, Google, etc.  I am from NYC.

Here are the factors between the two companies:

Type of company: Tech startup vs. government contracting (consulting gov agencies) firm

Salary: 83k vs 90k with similar benefits.

Location: NJ (1 hour from NYC, where I'm from) vs. Washington D.C.  

Size: Similar, &lt;50 people

Culture: I visited the office of the tech company and it seems to have wonderful people/culture.  On the other hand, I did not visit the office of the D.C. company and I don’t have a great idea on their culture.  In fact, I only had 1 phone interview with them before they decided to give me the offer (only because they were pressured that I already had another offer and would be accepting soon).

People I’d be working with: Tech firm has 1 other data analyst whom I will be working in tandem with, along with product managers. Gov firm has a few other data analysts, mostly working on the lower level analytics.  I will be the first hire in the gov firm with focus on more of the advanced analytics, and will be mentoring others.

Responsibilities: 

Tech firm: “Data analyst” title, working mostly with AB testing and experimentation of apps, building reports/dashboards on KPI’s/metrics, building models for customer LTV and predicting churn, as well as pricing optimization. Explore how advanced analytics can be applied throughout the company.

Gov firm: “Data scientist” title, developing data analysis solutions that include ML/AI to client problems such as giving input on data infrastructure, and building machine learning models (very high level overview of responsibilities, as it is dependent on the client problems).  

I am from NYC so in terms of location, I am leaning more towards NJ to stay close to friends and family.  I’ve always wanted to work in tech as well, but the government job seems to have more of a focus on ML/AI than the tech firm.  On the other hand, I’ve heard that government jobs don’t have as much flexibility with the work, as it is all about meeting client needs.  
Are there any other factors that I should consider?  Is there anything else I should consider in regards to working for government clients and how that could affect the kind of work I’d be doing?  Just looking for any kind of input that could help with making my decision.  Ultimately, I don't think either choice would be wrong but I want to optimally position myself to work on even bigger things in the future.

Also, thanks to the data science community here in Reddit.  I’ve been browsing a lot in the last year and have learned a lot from this sub.  So happy to finally achieve my dream of landing a DS-related job and I would be happy to share my experiences.  

Update:

Thanks for all the insights.  I decided to accept the offer at the tech firm, main reasons being proximity to home, culture that supports personal growth and fun, and wariness of red tape at government firm.  As someone pointed out, there's much less uncertainty working at the tech firm and I'm sure I'd be happy there."

       I've done research in different subreddits and  google ,i've been able to figure out how to get into Data Science. So I've figured out what I should learn and it's definitely something I want to go into and would get passionate about. I love what I do, but i think I want to try something different and challenging now.  etc.
I just need a few clarifications.


My background
  I have a BSc in Information technology. I currently work as a Systems/Business Analyst for one of the top 3 ERP companies. My domain is mainly in supply chain mangement. I have about 7 years experience as a systems/business analyst.

  I have a somewhat intermediate knowledge with programming especially in Java. Because i do maintenance and sometimes I have to debug and I write scripts with Jmeter for automation testing. So my algorithms and SQL knowledge i would say is intermediate. On the side I also do freelancing of web development. Mostly just wordpress sites.


So I understand I need to learn Python and maybe R. I was very good in mathematics and physics in high school.  I Had an A in all the mathematics and statistics courses I took in college. But I might have to have refresher courses which i think I would grasp easily.


So my plan now is to increase my side income (I create contents for people From Articles, to graphics, social media content etc) and I also have a small business on the side) for the next 6 months and learn all I have to learn to go into Data Science or Machine learning. After 6 months, quit my job and get a masters while still self studying and working on ML or DS projects. I come from Philippines and did college there so getting a Masters either in Europe or the US will increase my market value if I have to get jobs in western countries.
	Seeing my Background and domain experience in Supply chain Management, 


•	what would you advise to get a masters in? And what areas do you think I can focus on while self studying and working on DS and ML projects ?
•	 What path would you advise me to take? Data Scientist or Machine learning Engineer.
Looking forward to anything you can advise me on.

How to Get Your First Data Science Job: Interview with Michael Galarnyk,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1507262806,False,
Open Source Society University Program for Data Science - Worthwhile Endeavor or Waste of Time?,4,15,False,False,False,datascience,1507265103,True,"I'm currently a non-technical professional (healthcare middle manager) with a desire to change careers. I have an MA in English and a year of doctoral work, so I understand academia, but I never followed through. I also have a decent amount of STEM training (calculus through multivariate, differential equations, introductory linear algebra, discrete math, C++ programming, data structures, engineering stats), but that's now 10-15 years ago, and I'm pretty rusty.

I actually started down this path looking into web development in Python, but before I made much headway, a work project led me to look at the publicly-available Medicare cost reports for nursing homes. While looking into how exactly I would extract and analyze the data, I read up on SQL, Python, and pandas, which led me to articles on the current state of data science. For the first time in a long time, I found something that made me go, ""I want to do that.""

So long story short, my actual math, stats, and programming chops are just not there. I can remember bits and pieces of my college courses,  but I haven't touched the material in over a decade. I've read a lot of this subreddit, and I came across [OSSU's Data Science Program](https://github.com/ossu/data-science). After a lot of hemming and hawing, I finally started, but thumbing through everything, I realized that this is approximately 4 years of material following the stated guidelines, which are admittedly quite lax (5-12 hours of work a week).

Still, that's a long, long time, but I also realize that this is a field full of PhDs, so there has to be something said for the knowledge base required to perform the work. I have 2 major questions:

1) Can anyone comment on the quality of the coursework and actual course layout? I really like the introductory linear algebra course. I really feel like I'm getting insight into the material, not just learning to solve homework problems.

2) Short of enrolling in a structured program, which isn't an option right now, is there any other (faster) way to get a solid foundation to be able to work as a data scientist? A lot of online MS programs assume a technical background that I don't have.

I'm not desperate to get out of my career by any means, but it's definitely something I want to transition away from in the future, and I'd like to start pivoting now, whatever that looks like. Data science just seems like the most interesting avenue at the moment.

I realize that you can make a pretty good living running queries and generating reports, but that's not particularly interesting to me. To use an example I'm familiar with, while you can find very useful information doing queries from the Medicare cost reports (e. g., average nursing wages), the much more interesting questions to me aren't nearly as simple and, from my uninformed perspective, seem to require more sophisticated tools:

* Are there relationships between amounts and types of spending and profitability?
* Can a nursing home's cost report be used to predict its 5-star quality report?
* Is the nursing home industry going to see expansion, stagnation, or contraction in the coming years?

Any insight would be appreciated!"
How to get R Models deployed,10,8,False,False,False,datascience,1507285730,True,"Hi everyone,

so I hope I can ask you people how to handle the following:

Could you give me suggestions on how to run R in a productive system?

My hunch is that using Hadoop we could use RHadoop to write Map/Reduce code. But this would entail changing the algorithm wouldn't it? How do you rewrite algorithms to fit a Map/Reduce paradigm?

Open for suggestions!

How do you feel about products marketed like this? I am starting to get the impression that people view machine learning as another set of python libraries to solve an engineering problem rather than a practice rooted in math and science.

I haven't worked with this specific product, so I don't know how their system works. It is hard to tell where the line is between ""democratizing"" machine learning and irresponsible practice where all analysis is automated.

Would anyone recommend using Jupyter Notebooks within PyCharm for project management?,11,36,False,False,False,datascience,1507302045,True,"For my job I work on long-term model-building projects, and to date have simply used Jupyter Notebooks for the project lifecycle (EDA, Data Processing, Preliminary Modeling, Tuning/Feature Engineering, Benchmarking, Optimization, Production).

I'm considering switching to using PyCharm and doing the coding in PyCharm (either still using notebooks within PyCharm or as a traditional IDE). Whenever I need to present the code I could always throw it into a notebook as well. 

Or would simply using [a project directory like this](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) as a type of 'final draft' of finalized code be sufficient?

Career advice (warning long post),3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1507341120,True,"TL DR at the bottom :)

Hi guys and girls, I'm here to find some advice from some nice strangers on the internet :) . Before you roast me and tell me to go use the search button or the wiki, please know I already lurked through it. 

Keeping that in mind,

I'm a senior in undergrad (3 year bachelors where I'm from) in a B.B.A. specialised in Business intelligence. Since the term is pretty broad and based on what I read here I figured it was pretty similar so thats why I'd like your inputs on what to do next. 

For my undergrad profile, I'm in top school in my area (Eastern Canada) with a &gt; 3.5 GPA. I'm participating in many academic competitions and just recently came back from a student exchange in Singapore. 

In my school, BI major has classes that ressemble a mix of IT,math,Finance and marketing. Essentially we will learn SQL and NoSQL through Microsoft Server, SAS through data projects where we learn to extract format and analyse data,Tableau to visualize , Java where we develop applications and on my end I took a VBA class (I was going in finance until very recently). 

When I speak with recruiters, the response I get will be that they are super interested in hiring anyone with a BI oriented degree. For example: I went to see a big hedge fund this week and they were recruiting for Private Equity positions and I asked them if they needed BI majors and they were almost begging me to apply (at least that was the feeling I got).

That being said I'm really torn between heading to do a masters degree and working next year.For the masters, I have two options that I'm considering: Studying at my local university or going to France and studying at a Grande École (their Ivy league). I'd like to highlight that I'm bilingual (English and French) so there wouldn't be a language barrier. 

So heres where I specifically need input: 
I read about the war between Python and R on this sub (I feel that I would want to learn one eventually) but for the moment is SAS sufficient to work ? 

Will I learn significantly more by going to do a masters or by working 
? 

Will I be at a significant disadvantage compared to actual programmers or math majors ?

Will the masters significantly boost my salary ? (The statistics aren't widely available on the schools website since the programs are so new) 

TL DR: currently in school torn between grad school and work; know SAS but no R or Python don't know if it puts me at a massive disadvantage. Any input is appreciated :)

"Dear Data Analysts, to what extent do you have to know Python in your current/previous jobs?",29,6,False,False,False,datascience,1507343495,True,"Foreword: this is geared as a question more towards data analysts rather than data scientists. The difference I was told was that data science is much more programming heavy and involving of statistics and data analyst was more indicative of working with or manipulating that data. So this is just to clarify that this is geared more towards the analysis side. 



So I’m curious, to what extent have you been comfortable with python in your current or previous jobs? I’ve met a lot of “analysts“ at corporations that have absolutely no skills in python or even R. Admittedly, many of them do not have the title data analyst, so I don’t think they are really good source to ask about so that’s why I’m here! I’m wondering what level of familiarity data analysts have with python. I’ve seen posts here indicating that some people have just a working knowledge, and that they are not masters of it, while others have absolutely no knowledge and get by just fine. I’m genuinely curious."

I've been a lurker for a while, this is my first time posting. I'm a data scientist at a tech company working in marketing. I recently had a problem cross my desk that I had trouble framing, and thought I would appeal to the subscribers here for help.

The problem:
We give out discount codes in our emails the way many companies do. We noticed that the incremental revenue (revenue per customer) on some of these code-centric campaigns was lower than the holdout groups, leading me to believe that some of the customers receiving codes would have placed an order regardless of having received a code.

I wanted to test this hypothesis.

For example: Customer A orders every Monday and spends an average of $20 per order. His order patterns don't change upon receiving a code, but he'll use a code if given one. All of a sudden, due to discounts, we're getting an average of $15 per order from this customer because of the frequency with which we send codes.

Any idea how I could approach this problem?"

Advice for my Data Cleaning and Visualization project,4,6,False,False,False,datascience,1507421989,True,"Hi everyone! I am Junior college student with Statistics major and Computer Science minor. My plan is to work as a data analyst after graduation, and then, in the next few years when I've gained decent work experience as well as earned my Master Degree in Statistics, I will try to be officially a Data Scientist. 

For this Summer, I am trying to apply for a Data Analytics internship. I've talked to a few people on Reddit about my qualifications to apply, and they said it would be great if I can put a project using statistical programming languages. Now, as I only have the knowledge equivalent to the first semester of a year-long Applied Probability and Statistics course, I don't think I can do much with fancy data analysis or machine learning. Hence, I try to focus on Data Cleaning and Visualization, which I can compensate the lack of knowledge by my coding skill. 

For the project, I intend to perform a study of 10 - 15 graphs, charts and their applications. For instance, when to use boxplot and what we can learn from it. I will choose some not-too-dirty data sets to perform basic cleaning as well. And all the code for graphs, charts and cleaning work will be available in both R and Python. There will also be brief analysis regarding descriptive statistics for each graph.
With that idea being said, do you have any advice or idea on which kind of graphs I should include and which datasets I should use to make those graphs? It would be great if we have a website that provides comprehensive information about various kinds of graphs.

Also, as a beginner, I am still a bit unclear about data cleaning. I know dirty data may be missingness, incorrect data, or bad-formatted data, etc. but overall, given a dataset, I may not know how to conclude when the data is clean enough for me to do all the work. So, I definitely need some advice on that too.

Please help me if you can. I value our kinds of input you gave. The project itself is a beautiful learning experience for me, which helps me a lot in the future. Thank you so much!"

Is data science for me?,10,5,False,False,False,datascience,1507441346,True,"I am currently a data analyst debating if I should work towards becoming a data scientist or focus more on analytics. I am going back to school for either data science or analytics the choice is mine. 

At the end of the day for me the best part of analytics is thinking through how to solve the problem and then solving it. A lot of the time this is looking at data and determining how to use it. I however do want to present the data and help with corporate strategy.

In terms of prior knowledge I am my background is statistics and regression creation and analysis, however I am quite the beginner in programming. I know a bit of SQL and am very strong in Excel - I can generally hold my own with conversations with developers.

My fear with data analytics is I'll lack the fundamentals of extracting data. Currently I work with CRM and play with the data in Excel. But this route I have been told helps climb the corporate ladder.

For data science, I've been told there is not much climbing but you'll be a ""data monkey"" for the rest of your life (granted I'm sure that was a biased opinion). I'll extract and clean the data then my role is complete.

These are the two programs in question. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Is this a smart transition. What are the limitations/strengths with either route.

So, I downloaded months of recent years' data from greatsource.com, which included the opening lines, the 3-ways. These lines are based on their estimate of the three probabilities: the visitor will win; the home team will win, there will be a tie.

Transforming those lines to underlying probabilities (requiring the removal of the profit fudges to the probabilities) it proved that the vis and hom probabilities rendered r^2s of around .72, usually, for the total score.  Only around .16 or so usually for the winning margin.

Along the line, these past few months, I recalled seeing a data analysis concept concerning entropy, the idea that different levels
of result evidence different energy levels. Net zero; heat death of the universe? The concept didn't fit anywhere near perfectly but I decided to look into it. You could take the actual score margins as your data, but -6 to +6. Could add 6 to get a number? Yuck?

[Innyhoo, no way the new variable could take into account the visitor's contribution!]

I transformed each result to the number of games ending with the worst home result (usually the -6) and for the next result up added to that first number the number with this second result. Etc. Peak differences in the levels being at -1 or 0 results.

You remember me saying around .16? Here, the MR R^2 was around .81!  
 
And not worth much more of a darn compared to the R^2 .16 MRs are far as I could discover as I struggled my way to the near loss of my tiny online bankroll, abandoning the totals (R^2 .72) in my fanatic, frantic tries to make the ""entropy"" mis-use work.

What model and tools should I use for this project?,9,2,False,False,False,datascience,1507578828,True,"Hi r/datascience,

I am working on a model that takes a lot of different variables, most un-ordered categorical, but some could be ordered, and others integers, and produces a single floating point valuue (currency).

For example, the training data may look like this:

Name (index) | Weight |Age | Origin | Material | Condition | Price
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Vase #1| 3.25 kg | 60 | USA | Porcelain | Flawless | $40.00
Vase #2| 2.00 kg | 80 | China | Porcelain | Scratched | $25.00
Arm Chair | 20 kg | 40 | Mexico | [Wood, Leather] | Flawless | $100.00
...
I have about 10,000 richly populated rows like this. Now I'd like to train a model that makes connections between how the Weight, Age, Origin, Material and Condition affect the price of an artifact, and can predict the value of a new item based on current data.

For example:

Name (index) | Weight |Age | Origin | Material | Condition | Price
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Playboy Magazine | 0.10 kg | 45 | USA | Paper | Mint| ???


My thoughts so far:
Intuitively, I would want the building block of my model to be pair-wise relationships between variables, while the rest are being held constant:

For example, I would expect that weight and price would be positively correlated at low values. I would also expect that the slope of that graph would be fairly constant for all Porcelain objects, and that the slope might be steeper (price/weight of material) for porcelain than for, plastic, say.

I need your expertise reddit, what is the best way to go about doing this? Is there a specific type of model I want to look up? What tools would you use to go about doing this? I've collected the data using python, so ideally I would be able to keep working in python for the analysis and visualization components.

Thanks,

GW's boot camp seems the best for me, since the others will either require relocation or later finishing times due to prereq scheduling. It goes over excel, sql, python for ml (not neural nets...), visualization, hadoop, and ends with a capstone in 24 weeks.

I believe I can do this while getting another freelance project starting Feb 2018. Is the $10k worth, as I will obv try very hard upon joining it, or should I just spam job apps for anything related to data, soft eng, etc while doing freelance next year?

help differentiating factor scores/loadings and using them to compute correlations between factors and principle componants,0,2,False,False,False,datascience,1507660978,True,"Hey there-So I'm currently flipping through some reference Textbooks, and I'm slightly confused atm (I'm not sure if this is because it looks like loading and factor scores might be used interchangbly?).  I'm slightly frustrated because I'm trying to figure out the factor scores/correlation scores of the ith original variable on the jth PC in matrix form-but as I said I'm being confused here.

Let's start with what I think I Understand Suppose I have a data matrix X, columns are variables, rows are observations.  Then my covaraince matrix can be estimated via X^T*X, where X^T denotes the Transpose of X.  This has Singular value decomposition X^T*X = USV^T, where U and T are unitary, and S is the diagonal matrix of singular values and U is called the right eigenvectors of my svd.

If my covariance matrix is real and pos semi def, then my eigenvalues and singular values coincide, and my right eigenvectors are the eigenvectors of X^X 

Now, When I hear loadings of my variables on PC J, I think of the column vector A which is the weights of each original vectors in the linear combination that determines PC J.

When I hear Scores I think of the 'Distance"" of the projection along a pc by an original data column. 

Now, according to some of the literature I've read, the scores of my original are equal to U*S, as V*X is equivalent to this under matrix multiplication, and V is the matrix of weight coefficients used to construct pc J from the linear combination of my original variables.  When I think of the loading of factors, I think of this V.

Now-where I'm really confused is how I compute the correlation matrix of pc J and Variable I, because, As stated, I can't differentiate the two in some of my literature.

I would very much appreciate some help on this, and the more Linear Algebra detail you can give me the better!  Please let me know If i should give more detail!  "

MS biologist looking into data science? help!,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1507679558,True,"Hi All,

MS level pure cell/molec biology (Sep 2016) here, looking for major career advice. Been working for the past year in a medical device company and looking for jobs. I have an interest in data and I would like to limit my time at the bench. To be honest, job prospects don't look hot and I want to gain real, marketable skills.  

My situation as of now: 

-0 formal stats courses besides 1 formal psychology stats course that used SPSS (I took it in 2010).

-Some low level stats use in my experiments in graduate school and my work now. Excel and Minitab. I'd liken this to ""intro level stuff"": F-test, paired, unpaired t-tests, chi square, anova etc.

-Looking into Intro to Stats course at a local CC in the evenings.

-I am teaching myself Python right now, from various book sources + Udemy. The goal is also to get to R as well. Python and R appear to be major players in biology data. 


Questions:

-Is another MS degree necessary? I am not afraid of finding a working professional program, I am willing to do it.

-Bioinformatics or Data Science? Is bioinformatics too specific if I wanted to leave biology someday? Is data science ok for bioinformatics because I have a strong biology background?

-Top skills that you recommend- Python, R, SQL, etc?

-Can you really land interviews with data analyst/data scientist jobs with a profile on GitHub?

-Any other advice, please! 


Really appreciate it, thanks friends. "
Relevant Experience without Graduate Degree,5,2,False,False,False,datascience,1507685284,True,"Currently, I'm about to graduate with a double major in Math and Economics (course equivalent to a master's in Econ.)

I have a bachelors in Business Administration with a minor in information technology.  I've also read that they basically just take the courses from Coursera and you could find most of their lessons for free.  The program seems to require an advanced knowledge of at least python beforehand.

Udacity has designed their own courses and it is much cheaper overall. They also break the course down into two terms with the first being more of an introduction. They have set deadlines on the course material though.

They both have great reviews from what I have read online. There are two intro workshops with springboard but I feel I could prepare for the career track class with a much cheaper alternative. I have some background with python and statistics but I want to be prepared as possible before I jump in.

"Students: if you’re interested in practicing your skills in working with data, libraries are literally a goldmine",5,1,False,False,False,datascience,1507751963,True,"[Here are a few photos from the library on my college campus. It’s one of the biggest ones in Florida, standing 7 stories high](https://imgur.com/a/72apc). We have about five floors just filled with these reference books end to end. As you can see, I found a 1970s reference book on homosexuality. It was filled with tons of tables in which all of the samples were neatly laid out with how many people sampled, and the number of responses for each. This is where I get most of my sample data to plot python for practice. 



Not only is it super cool to be able to look at past data, but also, it is awesome knowing that I will never, ever be able to get to all of it. The library is about a quarter-mile long, and we are talking about seven floors just filled with hundreds of bookcases with reference materials from every subject. Philosophy, journal of experimental zoology, comparative neurology, government records dating back almost 60 years. But this is just one library. Think about it. I would literally never be able to collect and analyze the data in every single book. It just wouldn’t be possible. So if you’re looking for some really cool sample data or something to plot, check the reference section at a library or your nearest University. The possibilities are in list, and what you may find will surprise you.



As an aside, I will say this about the book that I found and picked up completely at random… The data detailed an era in which people were polarized against homosexuality. Many felt that it was an illness, many felt that they should not be allowed to show public affection or even organize together peacefully in the same place. This is completely objective data that was contained within this book. People were surveyed, and these were the responses. Most of the responses range from half to 3/4 opposing homosexuality. Just thought someone might find this interesting. Please, don’t bring your politics into this discussion. This is purely a discussion of data science"

I'm in my early 30s with a tenure-track professorship in physics.

My research, analysis and statistics skills are strong. I've used Python, R, SQL in my research (I'm comfortable getting things done in these languages, but am not an expert developer). 

 I think where I fall short is that (1) I lack experience in software development, particularly in a team environment (I have written plenty of software for my own research, and have published some of my code for general use, but have not worked on collaborative codes), (2)I have not done much web development, and (3) my breadth of experience with database languages and tools other than basic SQL is non-existent.

What steps should I take to get my foot in the door?  How hireable am I at the moment without a laundry-list of industry-specific skills, and what are the minimum steps I need to take to become hireable?

I was considering creating a data blog where I work on small projects that interest to me, with the code available on GitHub or similar.

I have a high gpa, one data science related internship, and some research experience.

The position is at a non-profit, and through its contract does not have any stock/bonus/other compensation besides 401k matching and base salary. The base salary I'm being offered is $80,000. This seems strong to me, though looking at entry level salaries in the Boston area has me questioning that initial excitement. 

What do you think? Is this a reasonable offer? Hold nothing back please - it seems like a cool opportunity, but I'm neither desperate nor married to the job and can take news be it good or bad."

Are there very few companies that need data scientists?

For example, I have a friend who works as a product analyst at a huge gaming company, but they don't care about data scientists because the gaming industry moves ""too fast"". 
Looking around on indeed.com, i found that there are very few data scientist positions (this is in SF bay area too) and when they do have positions, they usually want PhDs. 
The only companies I can think of that need data-scientists are huge companies that are super innovative, like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. This is because since they are so innovative, they need people in-house to build lots of predictive models for them from the huge amount of data that they have. They also want PhDs.

Two years ago, I shared my experience on doing data science in the industry. The writing was originally meant to be a private reflection for myself to celebrate my two year twitterversary at Twitter, but I instead published it on Medium because I believe it could be very useful for many aspiring data scientists.

Fast forward to 2017, I have been working at Airbnb for a little bit less than two years and have recently become a senior data scientist — an industry title used to signal that someone has acquired enough technical skills to lead projects. As I reflect on my journey so far and imagine what’s next to come, I once again wrote down a few lessons that I wish I had known in the early days of my career.

If the intended audience of my previous post was for aspiring data scientists and people who are completely new to the field, then this article is for people who are already in the field but are just starting out. My goal is to not only use this post as a reminder to myself about the important things that I have learned, but also to inspire others as they embark onto their DS careers!

Anaconda vs SAS / Is SAS really useful ?,15,3,False,False,False,datascience,1508071831,True,"Hello all ! I'm a wannabe data scientist, I am into my 3rd year of economics and 1st of a 3 year formation in data science. So now I'd say I study Big Data and econometrics.

We study 'python' and its more data-science-driven version 'anaconda', but we have that awful course in which we study the SAS language. Its syntax is horrific, it's not intuitive, slow, expensive (we have a free version but cmon, and it costs me time and storage anyway, up to 12GB) and we end up realizing with fellow students that it would have taken us 3h to do better in anaconda something we did in 10h of SAS (not to mention the teacher)

At first I thought that there were secret mecanics specific to sas regarding model estimation, linear regression and so forth.. but as time passes I seriously doubt its usefulness. Our python teacher even confessed he does not know SAS because it's useless to him compared to R, but he's not really a data scientist to my knowledge so I don't know. 

Can any professional explain to me if I have to really force myself to assimilate that language or do the minimum so I pass the exam and use my time to prepare R learning ?

I'm implementing some huge improvements and correcting a lot of errors in this role. However almost everything I do is in excel. We have excel and SPSS and my boss understandably doesn't want all of our reports etc. to be written in a language that other people don't understand. We have R and I play with it for my own purposes, but if I ever create something in R, I need to have an excel back-up version because they don't want to have to find someone who knows R to replace me later. I rarely use SPSS because I don't find it very useful and I would have to overcome some of it's limitations in excel anyway.


The thing is that I don't plan on staying at this job too long, two years max, and I plan on transitioning to the private sector when my work is finished here. I have a ton of creative work to do in this job because the person before me just did a mediocre job and didn't document anything, but I'm building my resume with skills that I don't want to use in my next job. If I build a niche for myself as a fixer that is fine, I just don't want that role limited to excel.

I know it's probably too early to plan this far, but I love statistics and don't want a job strictly as a software developer. Playing with data analysis is much more my suit.

But what direction should I take my PhD in to start developing new statistical/topological methods in predictive analytics... A PhD in Computer Science or a PhD in Statistics with a heavy focus on doctoral level math courses?

Can I do a fusion across C.S., Math and Statistics with the right advisors or is that much too broad and time consuming? Sorry for not having a simple question...I'm still discovering my interests. I'm really interested in computational topology from mathematics. "

Any recommended courses/books to build up on my maths?,7,23,False,False,False,datascience,1508169668,True,"Hey,

So for a bit of background, I originally did marketing at university and was working within marketing, but had a massive interest in analytics. I won't bore you with the details but a few months ago I successfully managed to transfer over to the analytics team in my company where I now work as a full time Data Analyst. I learnt Python and SQL through some online courses and recently completed a data science &amp; machine learning course on Udemy which has been really helpful. Whilst I am not a data scientist in my role, it is that path that I want to go down and as time passes there will be more and more elements of data scienece in my everyday responsibilities (for example I need to build a predictive model in the next few months as part of my objectives).

I am fairly comfortable with the coding aspect of the role, and the things that I don't know I usually figure out by reading around the internet and stackoverflow. However, I feel like there is a big gap in my background in terms of maths/stats and I really want to develop now to catch up with the rest of my team. I did some statistics as part of my course (binomial distributions, hypothesis testing) but I can barely remember it and I feel like it's only scratching the surface.

Is there anyone that could recommend some online courses or books for me to start building on this? Ideally I want to get the basic statistics down first, get comfortable with hypothesis testing and understanding how to prepare data well (feature selection, bias, etc), and then I'd imagine I need to develop on my linear algebra to fully understand the mathematics behind the models, correct?

I feel like if the place walked away from Tableau tomorrow I will be forced to learn a new BI platform in short order.  The other tool I use is Excel (not VBA but use everything else regularly).

Does anyone have any suggestions on what versatile skills/platforms I should learn on my own initiative (eg to keep my self current if I want to jump ship)?  Other companies around seem to use Power BI and R and Python a lot, and work may decide to switch to Power BI at very short notice if some senior management had their way.  R is not used at my workplace and neither is Python.

Also, work doesn't appear to be keen to pay for my CPD unless it is what I'm already working in my current actual job, so any request for training on R or Power BI would be out as logn as work doesn't announce officially there will be a switch.

Need Help with Classification Problems,9,1,False,False,False,datascience,1508184559,True,"So I'm working on this banking dataset that's hugely unbalanced, 40k rows and only 0.05 of them are 1s. I have a total of 74 columns, some of those are factors and some are numbers.

Exploring the dataset I've found that clients that have accepted the bank offer (1s), are mostly new clients, so their IDs are the most recents. Also the variable that counts the number of years that they've been on the bank is mostly low for the 1s.
I would like to use some classification algorithm like Bayesian Trees or Classification trees.

1)My first question is: is there a way to improve what algorithms will do on classifications? 
I was thinking about dividing those two variables in quantiles but I'm not sure if the two algorithm will already figure it out by themselves.

Another problem I'm having trouble is modelling the number of years the client had a bank count (again!): on my 40k observations it has 15k missings. It goes from 0 to 99, but looking at the data distribution I can see that nearly all the values are between 0 and a 40. My conclusion is that those 99 are some kind of missing or errors, here comes the second question:

2) What should I do to bring them into the range of the other variables? 
I was thinking about fitting a regression model on the other covariates then use it to predict their ""true"" variable.

The last problem that's making me think a lot regards the grouping of integers. I've seen that on some variables (some of which are really good on predicting my few 1s) I have a lot of values close to 0 and then they decrease till 400, with a lot of values from 30 till the end having just 1 on their absolute frequency. I was thinking about dividing them into classes and I wanted to know:

3) Is there an algorithm that is able to find the right number of classes I need to divide my variables in? Would that operation create benefits on my predictions? Is there an optimal way to also find the right length of my classes?

Big Data Analytics For Data Science?,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1508189465,True,"Hi all, 

I've been looking into data analytics (and BIG data analytics), data science, machine learning, and bioinformatics...

At this point, they all seem alike, with the exception of bioinformatics, which seems more specialized and doesn't seem to give me wiggle-room outside biology. And I'm looking into relating what I study with robotics, too.

I was going to do bioinformatics (since I only have a B.S. in biology), until I realized I'm not so stoked about wet labs and my wish is as simple as to find patterns in data--I love puzzle-solving. Dealing with wet lab is unnecessary for me. And robotics has been a topic that's amazed me for three years now.

I'm an introvert and enjoy team work but enjoy even more working alone. And I like to be challenged and I'm competitive. Oh, and I do admit I want to earn a 6-figure salary--being I grew up dirt poor, I just want it to stop feeling like a slave to never having enough. 

A professor recommended me to look into data science, after we spoke about bioinformatics, but the nearest college to my home has a master's in big data analytics (which some professors have told me is the same thing as data science). 

From all the careers I've listed at the start, which one would help me get into robotics starting from just having a BS in biology? And is data science and big data analytics synonymous to one another? "

forecast sales using price,8,9,False,False,False,datascience,1508240092,True,"Hi All

I have historical sales data by week for the last 2 years for all SKUs, and also have an average price for the week for each SKU for the same period.

I have been earlier using Holt Winters method that I had developed in excel that used to forecast without taking price into account and just using sales history and time periods (months) and that used to work reasonably well. I used to forecast the category total and then just applied manually the split per SKU based on judgement and history.

However, this time I need to incorporate price into the equation as the SKUs are price sensitive, and not only are they price elastic by themselves, the relative price between SKUs of the same category can cannibalize SKUs in the category that are slightly higher priced.

Is there a way that I can implement this forecast in any logical way? I only have Excel as a tool and nothing else, and I am someone who prefers a simple solution that gets me there 80% rather than a overly complex one that might get me to 100%.

If there is a way, please let me know. It would be appreciated.

Help with Reverse Geocoding Large Dataset,6,2,False,False,False,datascience,1508534393,True,"Hi,

I am an intern helping a company with data analysis, but I am running into a lot of issues. We have over a million data points that also have lat-long coordinates with them.

I want to reverse geocode the coordinates in order to get the zipcode for each piece of data - what would be the best way to do this? 

I was using R and tried using the reverse geocode method through Google, but that limits the amount of queries I can make a day, and, without paying, doing 2500 points a day for 1.4 million data points is going to take a really long time. 

I then found [this link](https://dmbeskow.github.io/Reverse-Geocode/) and attempted the fourth method he suggests. The fourth method requires downloading an excel doc (for the area the data was collected in) of zip codes (with coordinates), and then using a distance formula to find the closest coordinates between the two and matching a zipcode based on what is closest - however running the rdist.earth method requires 12,000gb of memory due to the amount of data, which makes that not an option.

Within R, I also have attempted making our data into a SpatialPointsDataFrame and overlaying it on a shapefile of zipcodes, or doing the point.in.poly function, but I always run into errors that I can't solve. I do not have any experience doing spatial analysis in R, which is my biggest barrier when working with the sp library.

I have tried switching to python, however I haven't used python before and a lot of the packages/advice I have found recommends using some other website's API to reverse geocode the data, which usually limits the amount of queries per day, even if you do pay.

Any help or advice someone can give? Maybe even pointing me to some tutorials that can help me out would be much appreciated. However, the large dataset still worries me because most functions will likely have trouble running on this many data points."

To do this, I could calculate the area between the curves (actuals vs model) and see which is the smallest on average for all parameter options for the model.Now I should be able to calculate an equation which passes through the all the points by solving a system of equations of the form 
y= a(x)^n + b(x)^(n-1)+ ...+ and then performing numerical integration and subtracting the results to obtain the area. Is there a better way go about this? Is there a good package in R which might make these calculations a bit easier to perform?



Edit: I just realized this won't work. If my model can predict the number of calls with 100% accuracy, then the area under each curve is the same, i.e. the total call volume, and thus the difference is always 0.

I'm being offered a data engineering gig for 40% more money.

Assuming I'll enjoy both jobs equally, what do you think? The pay bump seems too big to ignore, but I don't want to be in a situation where it's harder for me to get a data sci job because I switched to data engineering for a few years. Also, I plan to start a master's program soon (applied statistics). Will this hurt my chances of getting into a good school?

I'm definitely willing to do some prep on my own time.

After a few weeks of random google searches, I came across the Data Science for Social Good fellowship at UW, which seems great - keeping an eye of they open for 2018. It seems like every time I search I find new stuff, so I thought I'd ask Seattle based people if they're aware of anything!

"Have traffic flow and car crashes data, need help geocoding the car crashes to find the most dangerous road segments",0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1508588144,True,"Hi everyone,

I've found two open datasets and I'd like to use them to find the rate of accidents per 1000 km travelled on the most important segments of the province of Quebec, Canada.

The first dataset has the [car crashes reported to police in the Province of Quebec for years 2011-2016](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/fr/dataset/rapports-d-accident).    Here's the [doc](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/donnees-ouvertes/rapports-accident/rapports-accident-documentation.pdf)  The lat-long isnt available for location.  Instead, we have the following variables.  
  
* ""NO_CIVIQ_ACCDN"" , the street civic number  
* ""SFX_NO_CIVIQ_ACCDN"", a suffix to the street number  
* ""RUE_ACCDN"", the road name  
* ""CD_MUNCP"", the city code.    Here is a  [dictionnary to convert city code to name](https://www.mamrot.gouv.qc.ca/recherche-avancee/fiche/municipalite/).     

* ""NO_ROUTE"" is the road number where the accident happened (numbered roads are typically highways).   This seems to be used as a alternative to the road name RUE_ACCDN.  
* ""CD_PNT_CDRNL_ROUTE"" is the direction (North, South, East, West (Ouest) )  travelled on the road/highway.    
*   ""BORNE_KM_ACCDN"" is the milestone number (used on highways and northern gravel roads)   
  
  

They also use landmarks (intersection, etc..) to help locate the accident:
  
* TP_REPRR_ACCDN is the type of landmark.    
      * 1  means the intersection of two roads,    
      * 2 "" means ""other landmark""   
      * 0 means the type is not specified.     
* ""ACCDN_PRES_DE"" is the landmark that the type refers to.  It can be the road that intersects the road named under ""RUE_ACCDN"", a bridge, a school name, etc.  
* ""NB_METRE_DIST_ACCD"" is the distance in meters between the landmark and the accident.     
* ""CD_PNT_CDRNL_REPRR"" is the direction (North,South, East, Ouest) from the landmark to the accident.  
  
The second dataset is a shapefile, which contains the measured [traffic volumes](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/fr/dataset/debits-de-circulation-transports-quebec) for different road segments.   djma is the average yearly daily volume, djme is the average summer daily volume  and djmh is the average winter daily volume.  

I'd like to know geocode the car crashes so I can associate them to a road segment with a known traffic flow. many accidents happened on each road segments on a given year, then divide this by the  the average daily volume (djma) times the road segment length (?) to know how many accidents happened per 1000 kilometers travelled on that segment.   

Here is a [R script](https://github.com/SimonCoulombe/saaqmtq) where I imported and mapped the 
shapefile.  I've also imported the car crashes report, but I'm having a hard time 
geocoding it, with most markers ending outside my test city.  

cheers!"

I was first exposed to the field of data science through an internship at a startup here in Lebanon called Lyngro in the summer of 2017. Despite knowing nothing about data analysis I wanted to throw myself at the subject even if it meant dealing with a huge amount of information overload.

After two month working with the team on developing a recommendation engine for Arabic news articles, I decided to sit down and try to document each step of the implementation process (research to code) to first, give back to the community that taught me everything I know, in the hopes of giving someone with similar zero experience an easier way to get started, and second, to keep a detailed record/portfolio of the project.

Keep in mind that this series was written by a beginner for beginners, so I'm sorry for any oversimplification of concepts and lack of an advanced mathematical background. Hence, the reason I wanted to post each new entry of my series here is to get as much feedback, tips, and new learning material as I can to try and advance my knowledge in the field.

In CS, new grad recruiting season is now. Firms are willing to hire that early to get dibs on the best talent. But, I'm coming to realize that all of the culture/structure around hiring like you can read in /r/CSCQ is really in its infancy for DS.

Does DS have a similar recruiting cycle to CS where all the big/selective/hyped firms hire around now for late spring start dates? Should I just be holding off on applying for anything until Q1 or Q2? When should I expect more new grad positions opening up? 

Should I just keep looking and applying until something happens, or is there a sweet spot to aim for. It is a major time suck, time I could spend becoming an even stronger data scientist so that's why I'm thinking about it."

"US Bootcamps that require ""authorization to work"": Are Canadians, eligible for TN Visas, able to participate?",3,5,False,False,False,datascience,1508756314,True,"Can a Canadian with a PhD in a science discipline, though not in economics, statistics, engineering, or computer science still get a TN visa? It's a bit frustrating, since there appear to be [zero in-person data science bootcamps in Canada](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Data-Science-Big-Data-Bootcamps-in-Canada) (there are however some coding and web development ones, such as Lighthouse).

Although many US data science bootcamps seek to recruit STEM majors and scientists with PhDs, the online information supplied seems very vague on this, offering no guidance, especially with regard to visas. The only one offering specific guidance [Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html#apply), which offers this:

&gt; **Are international students eligible? What kind of visa do I need to attend?**

&gt; We accept international students for the program and encourage them to apply

&gt; However, we are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice. To the best of our understanding, you may participate in the program if you have a visa that grants work-authorization e.g. H-1B, TN, L-1B visas or F-1 students on Optional Practical Training (OPT), so long as the program is incidental to your status, or if you have any visa that allows you to be in the country to attend meetings, e.g. a visa status which allows for participation in professional seminars and/or non-academic, short course of study such as the B-1 visitor visa or the Visa Waiver Program. Please consult an immigration attorney for additional guidance. If you need an immigration attorney, consider using Adam Moses at Wildes Weinberg

From searching, I haven't found any suitable examples, such as. The nearest that I can find is a [Canadian citizen that did Insight Data Engineering](https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/191/programming/ask-me-about-going-data-bootcamp-1470295/) on a TN Visa, although he was an engineer beforehand.

And, as the Harvard Business Review notes, 

&gt; If the position clearly matches one of the TN occupational category and if the employee possesses a degree closely-related to the position, the applicant’s chances of approval are very high. [[HBR](https://hbr.org/2016/09/hiring-data-scientists-from-outside-the-us-a-primer-on-visas)

NYC Data Scientists: what is your role and your salary? Here's mine,150,115,False,False,False,datascience,1508800531,True,"Edit: responses not just limited to NYC!

Because the industry gives the ""Data Scientist"" title to people with differing levels of data-related skillsets, everything from generating reports to building machine learning models, comparing Data Scientist roles just by title or years of experience isn't enough--getting down to the comparison of skills and role is more useful. 

I've run into this while trying to collect more data about a Data Scientist's salary to use in future negotiations and understand my market value. My employer, like most I imagine, is pretty tight lipped about what others in my role make, and opaque about how they arrive at compensation numbers, so I hope this post helps us all a little.

I'd like to share that information with the community in the hopes that others will do the same, giving us all a bunch of data points where we can say to our employers ""I heard of Data Scientist X making Y doing Z in NYC"". Here it is, and thanks for everyone's participation!

* Location: NYC
* Title: Data Scientist
* Education level: Bachelors in Computer Science
* Industry/vertical: software-as-a-service tech company
* Company size: 500-1000
* Majority of time spent using (tools): Python, pandas, Spark, Jupyter Notebook, SQL
* Majority of time spent doing (role): writing ETLs, data analysis, reporting for A/B tests, communication to influence the product, building dashboards for monitoring metrics
* Compensation: $104k salary, some options, no bonus

Now the process is that we already have disposed of assets previously based on some cost measures and gut feeling factors.

Next semester, I unfortunately only have one elective choice due to conflicts so my adviser pointed me towards a possible CS course I can take. Unfortunately I'm not sure if it's worth foregoing my statistics elective to take the CS class. The descriptions are below:

* (Stats) : Categorical Data Analysis - Estimation, maximum likelihood, weighted least squares, log-linear models, logistic regression

* (CS) : Data Mining and Database Programming - Theory and practice of information management including PL/SQL; object and object-relational databases; data warehousing; data mining. 

I know being an expert in SQL is very important in DS as nearly ever single job posting I've seen required it, and I am currently a novice at the language as I use basic SQL queries (Oracle) at work to pull in data.

S.O.S - Third day as a Data Scientist. I'm lost.,72,128,False,False,False,datascience,1508966886,True,"S.O.S!

Hello my dear colleagues, I hope you can help with my current situation, or at least give me some guidance. Much much appreciated.



I've recently started my first job as a Data Scientist. The days prior to starting the job were great. Reading, learning, thinking about what I was going to do. Awesome. Wonderful. I was told there was a clustering phase, and intentions to create a churn model. But then it started. 





My colleague (boss, who had no experience in Data Science until this February and knows absolutely zero SQL(!)) and I were sent to a new client on Monday. It's an Insurance company (car, home, etc) and they had no analytics team whatsoever. We're supposed to do a clustering project (don't really know the goal of the this yet). 





**My problem is the following:** Their database is something along the lines of 2000 tables. There's no documentation about the database, explaining where the info about invoice, plans, info about customers, etc , is. We know of some tables but the names of the fields are just..It's not enough. 





My boss's idea was to download all the tables and load them in R (cause he doesn't know SQL) and get rid of the columns that do not have a lot of information. I insisted that this is not doable (*stupid*) and asked that he let me work in SQL instead, so now I'm a bit on my own, trying to get something out of the db.





Basically he was expecting to go to this client and a data.frame kinda of information to work on. He says he doesn't like to work with split data. Me neither, but this is not Kaggle.





**My question is:** How do you guys do, when going to a new job and a new client, how do you get familiar with a database with thousands of tables, thousands of columns with unclear names? 







I suggested to first plan what the ""data.frame"" that we want to work with looks like and get that information from SQL progressively, but my boss says that we don't know what data is important that way and is determined to download all the tables to his computer, and check one by one in R. I've given up on this route. I need help. What should I do. I don't know how to approach a new database because there's just too many tables and don't know where to get the information. 





:( 

I've thought about quitting and looking for a better job. I had no idea this was going to happen. I thought by the interview he was experienced.

Data engineer with MS Finance looking to transition to data scientist role,8,3,False,False,False,datascience,1508969696,True,"Headline: Is an MS in Finance 'close' enough to move from being an engineer to being a data scientist?

Summary: I'm currently a 'Software Engineer' at a mid-sized company on the data team. I handle ETL and architecture for projects that handle anywhere from 5 TB to hundreds of TB ingested per day. My day-to-day tools are Scala, Python, SQL, Spark, and Hadoop ecosystem relational/non-relational databases (HBase, HDFS, Redshift, Hive). In my graduate studies I took pretty heavy quant focused courses: stochastic calculus, options/future, portfolio analysis, derivatives, and some others. The classes relied heavily on probability theory, statistics, calculus, and linear algebra with R/Python/MATLAB. Definitely not straight up machine learning, but I have spent some time learning it for myself and in previous jobs have been a part of building ML models/pipelines (for a minor work project. Hopefully I can leverage my engineering chops in a field where it is lacking (anecdotally based on my experience working with data scientists at several companies, some cringe-worthy scripts punted over the wall to engineering).

Is this enough to get my foot in the door as a data scientist? If not, what steps can I take to get there?

Would a Masters of Applied Statistics prepare me for a data science job?,18,4,False,False,False,datascience,1508982278,True,"Hi r/datascience, 

I currently work as a data analyst at a large tech firm. I graduated 2.5 years ago with a BS in Applied Mathematics (with a few extra statistics courses) and a minor in Computer Science. I want to increase my skill set (in particular, handling big data sets and application of statistical modeling) to become a data scientist. Since 88% of all data scientists have at least a masters degree (and 46% have a PhD)^[1](http://www.burtchworks.com/2014/11/17/must-have-skills-to-become-a-data-scientist/), I know this will be necessary to achieve my goals. I want practical, hands-on experience so I can jump into a role and immediately apply learned methods. I am not particularly interested in too much theory or research at this point, so I am interested in shorter, more practical Applied Statistics Masters degrees over the typical MS in Statistics. 

The Masters of Applied Statistics program at Colorado State University has caught my eye. It has been around for five years (compared to UCLA's in its first year) and I would plan to attend full-time, on-campus for the 11-month program. I reached out to the director of the program for a list of careers graduates pursue and her list of 10ish jobs were almost all statistician at various companies. [Here](http://mas.colostate.edu/oncampus/) is the curriculum. For the lazy, here is the list of classes: 

* Three-week review course: Mathematical Tools for Statistics
* Three-week review course: Computing Tools for Statistics
* Probability with Applications
* Mathematical Statistics with Applications
* Experimental Design
* Mixed Models
* Regression Models and Applications
* Generalized Regression Models
* Applied Bayesian Statistics
* Methods in Multivariate Analysis
* Non-parametric Methods
* Analysis of Time Series
* Survey Statistics
* Statistical Learning and Data Mining
* Computational and Graphical Statistics
* Methods in Simulation and Computation
* Quantitative Reasoning
* Topics in Industrial and Organizational Statistics
* End with a six-week group consulting project 

**Do these classes seem like they would prepare me for applying to data scientist jobs?** I am concerned that there is no machine learning class listed. It looks like they offer a graduate-level computer science course that covers it. I may try to audit that class, or if anyone has online resources for self-teaching, I'd love to hear them! 

My plan after finishing the program is to either stay in Colorado or move to Los Angeles where my family lives. Either way, I would like to find a job that pays at least $100k. 

So, does this seem like a good plan? Should I go for a MS in Statistics instead? Help a fellow math lover out :)

--------------
I'm currently in the process of changing career from academic philosopher to data scientist. Having done a PhD and published in philosophy, I feel that I have excellent 'soft skills' and the ability to learn new concepts very quickly, as well as ask the 'right' questions. Techwise, most of my coding experience comes from writing Google Docs Add-ons (e.g. one called Cross Reference), but what I have done is fairly advanced for that limited medium and has involved solving (relatively) difficult coding problems.

I am completing the 'Data Science with Python' course on DataCamp and finding Python relatively easy (not *that* different from JavaScript). I am also learning statistics from textbooks and Tableau/Gretl from a Udemy course on DataScience.

My hope is to apply for a job by the beginning of June 2018. So my question is: how would my time best be spent between now and then to help me get into the best role that I can?

- Should I dedicate more time to stats or coding?

- I have been told to take on a data science project and document it online, but should I focus on some unexplored data that need a good clean up, or should I take an established dataset and do something analogous to other people's projects? How should I document a project such that an employer might see it? Can I put such 'hobby' projects on my CV?

- Is it realistic to expect to get anything above the entry level data analyst roles?

1. Would I be competitive for data science jobs at all (assuming my data science specific training is complete)?

2. Would I be competitive for data science jobs in Salt Lake City? I'm from Utah, love Utah, have friends/family here, and really don't want to leave. One reason I want out of academia is that it will take me to some far flung place away from all I love.

Beginner R and demand forecasting questions,9,5,False,False,False,datascience,1509047425,True,"Hey Guys,

I'm a MS Database admin and BI guy working in local govt, there’s only 1 of me in IT and I’m responsible for all things ""data"". I'm always reporting on KPIs and operational type reports and I want to do more. Now with Microsoft R in SQL server it seems like a good time to start learning things like Demand forecasting but relying more on SQL.


Anyway boss is on holiday and my are projects up to date - I had 3 weeks of learning R and trying to come up with a model that would predict the next 36 months of Services requests (stuff like burst water pipe, roaming dog, pot hole).


After finding a good YouTube video, I made a table that contained Type of request, Actual year and month, a summed count of the month, target year and month to predict, 60 months of lag counts, and 10 years lags. I set months and types to be factors in R.


Linear regression (rxLinMod) came back best, the train and test sets had a coefficient of determination around 93%. I tried BTrees (rxBTrees) and Decision forest (rxDForest) but they weren’t as good.


Cool, I thought let’s make it better. I built a table containing population count actuals and forecasts for our district and added actual population, 10 years population lag and 5 years population lead to the formula. 

The training set came back at 96% but the test set came back at 70%. Even with just the actual population and the lead/lag population columns removed the test set came back at 89%. 


Why are the results so different from the test set to the training set? I thought population would have a high correlation with the number of request raised.

Also as far as best practice goes should I be doing separate models for each Type?

Any recommendations on what to try next? I’ve just stuck to the default packages in Rstudio (but then my ComputeContext is the SQL server, no idea if they share packages.)

Is that data science?,5,7,False,False,False,datascience,1509109655,True,"Hi,

I'm currently working in InfoSec, and I wanted to know if my skillset could eventually be used for a reconversion in this field (To be honest it looks fun). From what I could see it looks quite close. But between the impression I got and the reality of the job there is chasm.

Basically my job involves parsing and probing lots of logs, find the proverbial needle in the haystack and get back to the source of the issue to fix it. Either manually by looking for weird patterns or automatically via scripted alerts etc. I'm to the IT what the plumber is to your kitchen.

My mind is wired to think in terms of patterns. I don't know how well this translates with real world data but most of the time IT is a really predictable environnement. Things happen for a reason, are reproducible most of the time and fall cleanly into algorithm-shaped cases.

To do this I need to automatize a lot of tasks as the sheer volume would drown me otherwise. Which implies skills in programming. BUT I AM NOT a developper. I know my limits, my jobs are more on the fly hacks and quick&amp;dirty scripts. Plus sprinkles of python magic to translate those into readable databases.

I have a mathematical background but more physics oriented really - especially signal processing. I know of statistics (statistical results do not faze me when reading papers) but I don't know them well. Nor am I using them day to day, used R only a couple of times for fun - that's it. If you know of French ecoles preparatoires system it might give you and idea of my math background.

As you might imagine, IT needs are a bit obscure to the layman, ITSec even more so. Especially as I have to present things and argue to spend money *before* things happen. Thus I am used to translating jargon into human speech.

My experience which was the closest to what I think is datascience was my last year of engineering school in my internship. I spent 6 months writing a script benchmarking networking cards for a data center. The script runned automatized tests under several configurations I had to create to simulate all the use cases. Then compiled the data, made graphs etc. I had to tweak it several time to answer needs of a couple other teams that got interested in the project. But it was a big ugly mess in the end. Even though it did the job.


So, thoughts?
Do you think it could work?
If no what skill do I absolutely need?

here's the link to the competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting

I think the problem is super interesting and a great personal project to show off on a resume.
With my buddy we decided to give it a try but we're having trouble dealing with such a big data base. Indeed, the train dataset contains more than 120 millions rows and 4 columns. I tried to load it with pandas but it's just crashing my computer. 

It's a time series forecast so working on only a fraction of the dataset doesn't seem like a good idea for us. (maybe it is actually a good idea, correct me if Im wrong).

We're now thinking about using a cloud service like Amazon to rent computing power but we don't really now what we need. We come from a mathematical / stat background so we're not super tech savvy.

If you guys are interested in this project we could use this thread to discuss strategies."

We are currently working on developing this platform that will teach data science to middle school and high school through practical exercises.

If you are interested and want to help, here are two ways!

Trying to create my own ML mind map. Hoping some more experienced ML'ers will fact check me?

I want to make a good one that is problem/solution domain based.  Do I have this right for my top level nodes?  Here is where I am headed so far: https://imgur.com/gallery/CugcS

My questions/doubts about what I have so far are:

&amp;nbsp;

- Is my starting point below generally correct?  e.g. no high level subclass is missing, and everything presented as a subclass deserves to be here?

- is Hybrid learning always just a combination of supervised and unsupervised?  Or, are there real examples of other hybrid models (e.g. 'reinforcement' and 'supervised', etc.).  I know _theoretically_ we can combine any methods...I'm looking for what's real/applied/demonstrable today.

- does Reinforcement learning belong at this high level, or is it actually a subset of one of the others (or one I've omitted)?  

&amp;nbsp;

1. Machine Learning

    1.1 Supervised (uses labelled data to train and validate)

    1.2 Unsupervised (uses unlabeled data, or ignores labels if they are present)

    1.3 Semi-supervised (uses partially labelled (mostly unlabeled) data)

    1.4 Hybrid (combines a supervised method and an unsupervised method)

    1.5 Reinforcement Learning (uses data from the environment)

"Likely job offer on new data science team, worried I'm assuming too high",8,9,False,False,False,datascience,1509220440,True,"So, brief bit of context - my company is starting a new data science team and is aggressively investing in the recruiting process. Internally we have very few individuals that know / use machine learning methods, me being one of them.

The VP overseeing the construction of this team is very interested in recruiting me for the team as he knows I have data science skills, and I've also worked with him directly using machine learning to  solve a business problem.

Part of my concern is I'm not sure I'm ready. I was encouraged to apply to a manager position they opened with the team which would likely operate as an individual contributor for some time. I'm confident I can use R to handle most problem sets that come up, but am still working my way through learning python. Additionally, I've never used Spark/Hadoop/AWS (their data structure) and my SQL is pretty rusty. On top of this I'd really like to get more statistical methods under my belt so I'm not limited or at least know where to look to learn more to solve certain officer problems.

The upside is I'm a very quick study, and the position itself will likely not require highly advanced techniques for a while. There are some NLP problems that will come up and I don't have any experience with those, but I understand the approach and how the methods work conceptually.

I'm sure this all reads as a bit like imposter syndrome, but I feel conflicted that I might get this position and fail because I still have areas I would like to grow in before I'd feel very confident calling myself a ""data scientist"".

Can anyone else relate, or have similar stories? Any thoughts, advice, or words of encouragement?

I have a question about what significance test I should use if want to compare two categorical variables within the same group/people.

For example, say I ask teachers to rate their students in terms of certain problem behaviors when students are in classroom or in the cafeteria. I could set up a 2x2 table, with environment as one variable (classroom or cafeteria) and whether they showed signs of a problem behavior, like being too loud/noisy. My problem is how to approach this analysis, because in the 2x2 table the same students are being used in the classroom and cafeteria settings. In other words, the assumption of independent observations is broken for the standard chi-square test.

In short, I am trying to figure out which significance test to use when I cannot use the chi-square because the groups I am comparing are the same people. I cannot use a paired/dependent t-test because I am trying to compare the incidence of behavior and not some continuous measure.

I'll then research why we may be getting such a huge spike of these specific calls and present my findings to management with graphs, percentages, etc. I also do a lot of internal stuff to make sure our staff is handling things correctly (like quality examiners listening to calls - how accurate are the 'mistakes' they are writing to our customer service reps on the phone).

* My job is like 95% building reports via excel. I'll grab information from various areas (Cognos, Access) and then convert that to Excel and build pivottables all day. I don't build any queries myself though or do anything in Cognos other than grab data.

As someone coming from a non-technical background (I studied psychology, global health, and marketing in college) who is early in her career and looking to potentially go to business school in the next 5 years, is this program (or another business analytics program) worth it? I currently work in media/advertising and am looking to broaden my technical background. I'm less than 2 years into my current career, so definitely think additional training would be helpful in the future in case I switch industries.

Any advice from those who have considered/completed business analytics programs would be helpful!"

Resume parses really well, so, no issues with that. I asked my sister who works in HR for a tech firm that would a 2 page resume be ok and she said it's fine because mostly it's software so rarely recruiters would look at your pdf.

I would posit that 95% of the data science world is not working on these types of problems.

I have some experience with Python (and other languages), and am learning more, primarily motivated by the current subject.

**QUESTION:**
I would like to do the two calculations in the following multiple-variable analysis (although in reality, my dataset has a much greater number of variables).

What is a suitable kind of software/algorithm I should start researching for this kind of thing?

___

*STARTING DATASET:*

Assume I have a few hundred thousand datapoints with the following parameters:

- Person Age

- Person Weight

- Person Mental Health Score (1-5 scale)

- Person Physical Health Score (1-5 scale)

- Suicide Attempt Severity Score (1-5 scale, with 1 = didn’t attempt suicide, 5 = attempted+committed suicide)

___

*CALCULATION 1:*

Let’s say I specify a particular pair of values for the following parameters (one or both of these exact specified integer values may or may not exist in the original dataset):

 - Person Age = 17
 - Person Weight = 120

Given the above, I want to calculate which values of the following parameters would maximize the Suicide Attempt Severity Score.

 - Person Mental Health Score
 - Person Physical Health Score

___

*CALCULATION 2:*

For a new Person (outside the original dataset), let's say that, for the following parameters, I specify some values (again, one or all of these exact specified integer values may or may not exist in the original dataset):

 - Person Age = 15
 - Person Weight = 140
 - Person Mental Health Score = 3
 - Person Physical Health Score = 2

Given the above, I want to calculate the predicted/expected value of Suicide Attempt Severity Score for this new Person.

Freelance data scientist for 1.5 years. Advice on next steps?,4,5,False,False,False,datascience,1509526935,True,"I have been freelancing as a data scientist on a remote basis for about 1.5 years. I started doing some small-scale projects on Upwork for individuals, and gradually have started entering bigger contracts with start-ups and a couple of larger organisations.

The purpose of my post is two-fold:

1) to determine how I should be branding my experience from a resume standpoint

2) what sort of target market (in terms of companies) I should be pitching myself to going forward

1) As for the first point, a lot of the bigger projects that I have been doing have been under NDA. So, this has left me in the position where I can't name the client directly or give details about the project directly on my resume. At the same time, I've been publishing data science tutorials on my own website and others as well. I'm also currently in talks with a major publisher to produce a training series.

In this regard, I am trying to emphasise the achievements from a resume standpoint without giving client details away, and also discussing projects that haven't required an NDA.

As a rough example:

    DATA SCIENCE CONSULTANT AND PUBLISHER
    - Deliver extensive project solutions to range of clients, including individuals, start-ups, and larger 
    organisations. Industries have included X, Y, and Z.
    - Awarded 5-star testimonial for positive project outcome by over 70% of clients.
    - PROJECT 1
        ▪ Goal of project
        ▪ Algorithm(s) employed
        ▪ Achievement
        ▪ Achievement
    - PROJECT 2, etc...
    - Leveraged social media and SEO strategies to build dedicated data science mailing list of over 
    1,200 regular e-mail subscribers, and website of 4,000 monthly unique visitors.

The above is just one example, but is this a potential way of going about it?

2) As I mentioned, start-ups in particular have been approaching me for my services. I'm in talks with one particular client for a potential full-time remote role, and have also been getting referrals to other clients in the start-up industry. If this is becoming my niche, would it make sense to continue the path I'm currently on? i.e. continue building my client base and full-time roles may be more likely to appear that way, or should I be going the traditional route and sending out my resume to larger companies? The thing I've found is that if a client has an opportunity to see what you can do first hand, then that tends to convey much more than a resume.

To summarise, data science freelancer with 1.5 years experience doing projects mainly for individuals and (increasingly) start-ups. Would appreciate some advice as to how I should be proceeding from here in order to advance in this field."

Any advice for analytics/data science students on boosting one's resume?,5,0,False,False,False,datascience,1509546525,True,"I'm currently on my final year of my bachelor's degree in MIS and I'll be entering the Master's program for Business Analytics next year.

Considering a complete career change -- go for the BS or the MS?,9,11,False,False,False,datascience,1509550573,True,"I'll try to keep this short. I graduated with my BA in Psychology in 2014. It is a field that really requires you to have an advanced degree and it's really just not what I want to do and it's not really feasible for me, as I would not have the required volunteer experience/letters of rec required for those sorts of programs. I also need something that's 100% online due to my schedule. 

 I've been looking into data analytics. I LOVED and thrived in all my stats courses during my undergrad (took 5 of them). The more I read about this field, the more I want it. 

My question is this - should I pursue a Master's? which might of course require some additional pre-reqs due to my BA being in an unrelated field, but the world I'm coming from - higher degrees are ALWAYS required. But from what I'm reading, a BS might suffice? Buuut since I already have a bachelor's, I'm thinking maybe just going for the master's would be better? 

I'd love to hear opinions from those in the field and if you have any suggestions for 100% online schools that offer this type of degree, that'd be awesome. Bonus points if that school offers discounted tuition rates for active duty service member spouses. 

I've only just begun my research so I realize I dont have all the info yet but I thought this would be a good place to start.

How would I turn survey data into a regular dataset?,8,9,False,False,False,datascience,1509558316,True,"[So here I have a set of survey data. enter anything in, and you’ll see survey responses. ](https://opir.fiu.edu/instructor_eval.asp) what I did is scrape or download this data into excel. But there’s serious formatting problems with it preventing me from working with it. 



Problem:

The data is in matrix format. There are five questions and each question can have one of five responses which is matched with the number of students that responded a certain way. Then, there is the entire table which repeats endlessly for each class. So the data is repeated over and over again repeatedly for each time there is a different class answering the survey. 



Options: 

A. Create a summary table which counts The number of students that responded certain way to each question, thus creating one compact summary table of about five rows and five columns (5x5) 


Serious disadvantage of this is that this is not a data set. This is a summary table. 


B. Convert The tables from matrix format to entry format. As it is now, the columns do not repeat, but the rose do repeat. So each question it’s repeated over and over again in each table, but columns are associated to the quality of response from poor to excellent. 

We could convert the entire data set to entry format. What this means is that instead of tables independent of one another, we now have entries that are all mixed together and not tied to a specific course that the surveys were taken from. In order to do this, instead of counting the number of students that responded a certain way, we would instead record each student and their response with an ordinal number (1,2,3,4,5) where 1 would be the lowest quality (poor) and 5 would be the highest quality response (excellent). Thus, we would have a massive data set with thousands of records to be worked with. However, the questions would be the columns, the student number would be the index, and their response to each question (1-5) would be marked in the each cell. 


Example: 


Student - Question 1
1                 5
2                3

Advice: Should I get a M.S. in Data Science?,11,1,False,False,False,datascience,1509567835,True,"Hello,

Just a little background, I already possess a M.S. in Physics (2015) and since been trying to transition into the data science/analytics industry. I have done things such as The Data Incubator bootcamp and have a decent grasp at basic concepts like machine learning. So I'm not a complete noob. 

Unfortunately, I have done interviews and always fall short of landing the job. It has mostly been due to experience in knowledge and work. But it hasn't been all bad as I am freelancing to pick up projects when I can and currently working on a contract that could potentially lead to a full-time job. 

My parents are tired of me failing in my job prospects and my father keeps insisting I go work as a physicist instead of a data scientist, despite the fact I've spent all my resources into learning more and more about machine learning and other topics in the field. As a result, they are almost forcing me to apply to graduate schools to get another M.S. (stereotypical asian family).

My question, ""Is it worth it to even apply to graduate schools now?"" If I did apply I would only apply to ones I would really want to go to vs. just to get accepted. 
i) It forces me to retake the stupid GRE (hate it and std exams with a passion) because my scores are expired. Not hard, just annoying
ii) Would I even be competitive vs. other applicants.
iii) Is it even necessary? My gut instinct says I should just focus on building my career and see where my freelancing and continuing job search takes me. 

The pros of continuing another degree would be to focus on fields I'm most interested in like NLP (i know some stuff, but it getting some expert knowledge on it would be awesome). The fact that I could be eligible for internships since I would be a student, that would finally get me that ""work experience"" in industry that so many jobs are looking for. 

I'm not looking for interview advice or anything because I am very well aware of my current weaknesses (which I am working on rectifying). 

I'm at a crossroads in my life and seeing what professionals and others think I should do. "
What's your best Jupyter notebook tips and tricks?,38,101,False,False,False,datascience,1509569777,True,"What are some good Jupyter notebook tricks you've pick up?

One I recently discovered was the magic command for reloading local Python modules when changes occur. I'm working half in PyCharm and half in a notebook, so when I'd change something to my modules in PyCharm, the changes wouldn't show up for use in the notebook.

Turns out you can use the magic command above your imports to first load the extension required, then you can define which module you'd like to autoreload:
    
    %load_ext autoreload    # load the extension
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    %aimport DataCleaningModule    # designate which module to reload each cell run
    from DataCleaningModule import text_processors as proc

If you have a .py in your module you want to reload every time (*text_processors* in my case) you just need to use *%aimport* on the module that contains your .py and Jupyter will get the changes every time you run a cell!

What are some of your tips and tricks?

I've nearly finished the Coursera John Hopkins course on data science with R. It was pretty decent, some sections were definitely better than others. I know want to move on to a python data science course. 

I have used both Python and R for data science extensively, though I have probably used R more. I've been using Python for a couple years now along with many of the data analysis libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn and their R equivalents.

I was wondering if anyone knew what the best python data science course is? I don't want a course which starts from the beginning and assumes you've never coded with Python before, but I also don't want a course which expects you to be a data science god. 

Are their any good intermediate to advanced courses in Python which go data analysis and machine learning? I am fine with paying for them.

Looking for advice regarding pivot,5,2,False,False,False,datascience,1509591168,True,"Hi all, and thank you to anyone who takes their time reading and replying to this. I am currently a biology undergraduate, and I will be graduating in May 2018. I have recently been introduced to programming and data via an REU this past summer, where I worked in MATLAB using a relatively large oceanographic data set over 3 years from 15 stations. I learned I really enjoy programming and working with data, so I scheduled Intro to Computer Science using Python and Biometry this semester. As time has passed, I have been considering pivoting to pursuing data science, which has been kind of bittersweet for my last year of school because 1) I had been set on pursuing marine biology since I was a kid (which led me to tunnel vision, not explore other fields, including other disciplines in marine science, etc.) and 2) I am less enthused about my biology courses (might just be senioritis, though). Thinking back, I never really felt the excitement I do when learning about computer science with any of my biology courses. I have also always been passionate about marine life and the ocean, and I do well with biology, so I just went with it. 


My degree is not math-intensive at all; the last math I took was Calculus I (4 years ago...), which isn't even required by my degree (Survey of Calculus, but Calculus I can replace it). I plan to take Linear Algebra next semester. I was planning on taking Calculus II and another CS course, but my advisor kind of screwed me. She assured me that I didn't need to take a specific biology elective, and it turns out I do, so I had to completely rearrange my schedule... 


To get to the point, I have been researching my options in order to pivot from biology to data science. I was looking at a second bachelor's in CS at a university the next city over, where there is a data science concentration. I would be able to finish this with 53 extra credit hours (~2 years). To get a CS bachelor at my current university, it requires 64 extra hours, and there are no specific data science courses. I also looked at the Georgia Tech OMSCS program, which is one reason why I am taking Linear Algebra next semester. It would be significantly cheaper (more than 50%), and from what I can tell, it seems like a lot of hiring managers look for at least a M.S. Both routes would take the same amount of time, but I don't know which would be best because I feel like I might be missing out on a significant amount of theoretical knowledge obtained with a B.S., and I am also worried because my math background is too weak (though I have always been pretty good with math and am not worried about being able to catch up if need be). 


Any insight is greatly appreciated. I have been feeling pretty lost/depressed lately, but I guess it's good that I discovered this about myself before being a year or so into a marine biology M.S."

how much math do you really need to know for data science?,14,6,False,False,False,datascience,1509611698,True,"I see an inconsistent number of answers to this question all over the internet. Some say you need to be an expert in calculus and linear algegra while others say all the complex algorithms are already done for you in sklearn so you don't need that level of expertise. With sklearn, I know you need some math and statistics skills in order to understand what the algorithm is telling you, but do you really need an intense understanding of calculus and linear algegra to do data science? Some argue it is needed while others say its a scare tactic to keep people out of the field and keep demand high. 
It almost feels like saying, ""hey you need to know C++ in order to write sql because sql is written and based on c++ which is obviously not true because you don't need C++ to write sql code.  

I just want to clarify, I know you need math(pretty solid background in stats ,but not a phd level) to do data science, i'm not disputing that, but my question is do you need to know in depth linear algegra, calculus etc... in order to do data science.

Looking for clarification on decision tree algorithms using CART (Gini index) as a split,9,3,False,False,False,datascience,1509628149,True,"I understand how calculating the Gini index works for each column of a set of data and I understand how you can then choose which other column of data to split based on the purity of the index with respect to the parent node you are now splitting. Let’s say you have a set of data that contains columns: education (none, highschool, associates, bachelors, graduate), work_experience (none, 1 year, 2 years, 3more years), owns_credit_card (yes, no), marital_status (single, married, divorced), children (none, 1, 2, more), buys_house (low, average, high, very_high). So assume you are creating a decision tree to determine the likelihood that someone is going to buy a house. The target would be buys_house. I am wondering logistically how you would begin and end the tree. And I don’t even know if it’s logical to use Gini index for this set of data because I just made all those categories up but theoretically if it was already decided that this was the method we were going to use. Do you start with the node or column that has the highest Gini index (closer to 1) because it has less purity and therefore has the most options for nodes? Or do you begin the decision tree with the node that would have the lowest Gini index (closer to 0) because it is the most pure and exhaustive? And if there’s no rule stating either way- I’m also curious which would be the most optimized in regards to performance?

PhD in Analytical Chemistry -&gt; Data Science? Fellowships?,6,5,False,False,False,datascience,1509630605,True,"I expect to finish my chemistry PhD in about a year/year and a half and am considering trying to peruse data science afterwards. However I am a little bit at a loss of how I can transition from my experimental heavy chemistry PhD to data science. Here's why:

* All my PhD experience is in doing bench chemistry, designing methodology and running instruments. There is little data analysis done in my lab and everything is done in excel
* I only know basic Java and Python from either teaching myself or comp sci electives I took in undergrad 
* I've never taken a stats class. My knowledge of stats is very elementary and consists of only things I needed to know to understand papers (ex. p values and confidence intervals)
* I took linear algebra in undergrad but I don't remember much of it since that was about 6 years ago now. 

I recently found out about the data science fellowships (Insight, Data Incubator, etc.) which seem like they are advertised towards people with PhDs in a non-data science discipline who want to learn data science. But from reading this sub it sounds like those fellowships are only awarded to people who already have the skills and knowledge to work in data science and just need help getting a job. 

If I wanted to apply to those fellowships when I graduate, what should I do in this last year/year and a half to make myself competitive? Would I even have a chance? Should I consider doing some type of bootcamp? Would I be able to get an internship that would teach me with my limited credentials (I'm required to do an internship before I graduate).

As the title implies, I've got a background in stats and data science, but my ~2.5 years of professional experience thus far has been entirely software development. From the few interviews I've taken on the side, this has actually seemed to be beneficial, as a lot of data scientists with strictly data science education may not have great hands on programming skills (which are a big part of data science). Employers seem to take kindly to the breadth that comes with an education in stats/ds but with applied software expertise. My title is currently ""Data Scientist"", which at least gets me plenty of linkedin messages.

I'm at the point where I'm starting to feel like I am losing grasp on all that I learned in my stats/ds studies, and I'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas to stay relevant, stay fresh, and keep my data science skills honed. Additionally, how can I *prove* this? They're going to ask for examples of my work, and I'm going to have to say ""Welp, I spent 2.5 years writing software"". I'm scared my prospects are slipping.

I 100% want my next job to be data science, but I feel like every day I spend at my current job is moving me further from that, even though I'm developing a lot of valuable skills...

What is the best path into Data science with good programming bg but not a lot of Math?,14,0,False,False,False,datascience,1509761171,True,"Hi all,

I am finishing my Honours this year in CS, I have good grades (A average) and next year I am going to work towards a Masters in CS focusing on feature selection (scholarship depending). My issue is I have quite strong programming background, however, my university was not very theoretical for CS - and required only basic math papers (introduction and discrete mathematics, intro statistics) so I am lacking in these areas.

I would like to move into DS in the future, and have been considering trying to get into a DS program in Europe once I have finished my studies here. Potentially a Masters of Data Science. Does this sound like a good path? Obviously It would be quite a steep learning curve, but I believe it should be manageable.

I am python (and javascript (and scheme)) developer looking for a project idea.

A few months (or years) back I started a project to help me with graphdb and conceptnet with the hope to put it to good use for doing some NLP stuff. That was a graphdb embedded in Python that is very easy to install or very easy to run. Similar to sqlite. With a Gremlin API. Anyway, after some time fiddling around text summarization, question answering, wikification (and reading about opencog). I figured out that that NLP doesn't really need my project and most of the work done in data science evolves around crunching a lot of matrix operations best done in RAM or with the help of GPUs. They are a few like opencog that do use relational model for both their KB and algorithms but I found no other examples. So there is no need for my bigger-than-RAM relational data store. I diven into the world of datascience a bit deeper I discovered that one of the weaker point of the datascience work flow was wrangling. Basically some kind of extract-transform-load (or extract-load-transform if you prefer). The tasks handled by Google dataprep. But that niche is already taken, there is even free alternatives.

Aspiring Data Scientist: Do I persue an internship in software engineering or data analytics?,2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1509935102,True,"Some background:
 
* I'm an undergraduate student in Data Analytics

* Currently interning in IT Business Intelligence at a medium size company

* My goal is to become  a data scientist/machine learning scientist in the future. I hope to achieve this by progressing through industry, obviously, and perhaps with the help of a Masters in Statistics as that is my primary interest.

I have two internship offers on the table: Software Engineering @ Target, or Data Analytics @ Ford.

For someone who wants to become a data scientist, does it serve me better to take the software engineering position to diversify my skill-set and hone my competency in writing industry level code (especially since I'd have something to show for software engineering w/ a relatively short time commitment) while supporting my statistics and data processing knowledge through my coursework and current internship.

OR is it the case that if I want to become a data scientist that software engineering is only semi-related and that I simply keep going down the path of data analytics and continue to increase my experience with tools like Qlikview, Hadoop, R, Python Alteryx, etc. that an experience at Ford might afford? (no pun intended :P)

**tl;dr:** to progress towards becoming a data scientist do I do as much data related as possible stuff or is dabbling in pure software engineering valuable?"

"Open course recommendations/career advice for someone who wants to improve big data skills, but not be a true ""data scientist?""",2,10,False,False,False,datascience,1509962407,True,"Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this sub is the best place for this question, but I'll gladly move it if not.

Anyway, I recently got laid off from my job as an analyst in a boutique consulting firm, and I'm trying to figure out what to do next.  My job involved creating market forecast models in Excel, as well as using SQL to build, query and analyze data sets from the government and insurance companies.  Because I think an ability to work with big data will only become more important in the future, I thought it might be a good career move to expand my working knowledge beyond the basic queries I learned from SQLZoo.  There are a wide variety of open courses for big data and data analytics out there, but I'm not sure which ones would be best for my situation.

I should be clear that I'm not really looking to become a full-fledged data scientist.  I have an engineering degree from a well-respected state school, and my quantitative/analytical skills are well above average.  However, they're not truly top-tier, and I don't think that I really have the mathematical chops or background to compete against math and physics Ph.D.s.  These are the types of folks who come to mind when I think of true data scientists, and the reality is that I'm not at that level.

But I do think that because of my engineering and consulting experience, I might be able to a niche for myself as some kind of data-driven consultant or in-house business strategist--someone with more hard big data skills than the average business analyst, but more on the business side than a typical data scientist.

So, do you think that the idea of ""learning big data without being a data scientist"" makes sense from a career standpoint?  And if so, are there any open courses you would recommend for someone in my position?  Any help is much appreciated. "
What tool to use? For real-time data analytics displayed to users via webpage,3,7,False,False,False,datascience,1509963081,True,"Hey,

Hoping this isn't the wrong subreddit but please let me know if there's a better place to post this! 

I'm making a simple web app as part of a personal project. 

I've made the database in MySQL and am currently designing the front end wireframes - I'm yet to decide which tools to use to develop this. 

The overall concept is that data will be generated for the user, and they will then be able to view data visualisations based on that data. The data can change throughout the day, and will be different for each user (identified through a userID). They should be able to log onto the website and see analytics in their user area. They should also be able to download the visualisations to a PDF report. 

They should be able to see at least some charts, graphs, and in an ideal world some gimmicky infographics (but this isn't necessary). These don't need to be interactive, but it'd be cool if there was an option to do this. (Like slicers or filters in PowerBI). They should not be able to view the raw data. 


My question is: what tools might be suitable? I need something open source or at least low-cost, as it's possible but unlikely that this will become a commercial project or be profitable.


If it helps, my area of expertise is BI - relational data, MS full stack, powerBI etc. This is a new adventure for me.

Getting into data science in your mid 30s with a non technical background....possible with MOOCs and a program like K2 (or other programs)?,21,23,False,False,False,datascience,1510069900,True,"I am currently in my 5th year working as a registered nurse. I am very unhappy of the thought of spending my working life in nursing and looking for alternative career options. I’m very interested in technical areas like data science but currently have no technical background. I have two bachelors degrees, one in nursing and the other in economics.  Prior to nursing, I worked for several years in typical non technical 9-5 office job for a consulting firm, first as a business analyst and then a project manager. 

I’m not super keen on going back for a 3rd bachelors or even a Masters or expensive boot camp as degrees od not guarantee breaking into a field. With the plethora of online resources available, is it possible for somebody like me who already has a college education but not ins technical field to pick up the necessary skills to get hired into data science? I’m also in my mid 30s (likely I’ll be in my late 30s when I am ready to enter the field) so that may be a negative factor as well. 

The K2 bootcamp seems like a thorough program and not insanely expensive ($7k), but I would need to complete their prerequisite recommended course work. I’m also considering doing some of the relevant computer science coursework in the OSSU (Open Source Society University) curriculum to prepare for something like K2.

Advice for Data Science masters student looking for temporary employment,4,22,False,False,False,datascience,1510110438,True,"Hi r/datascience! I am in a very unique situation with no one to turn to for advice so here I am.

Having just graduated from a top private US college with a degree in Economics, I am currently studying a masters in data science in a European university with a strong Econ and data science program. I had very little background in coding before the program started in September but I am working on strengthening them right now. The program has a strong theoretical focus but at the same time we are learning and using R, Python, SQL, Hadoop and some other data science-related software. I am a fast learner when it comes to quantitative subjects so I am doing pretty well so far. Together with the masters thesis and industrial practicum I have to complete next semester, I am confident that I will have the necessary skills to apply for and obtain junior/entry-level data scientist roles. 

The catch is that I am on a government scholarship which requires me to return to my country after one year of work overseas. This scholarship is also the reason why I am pursuing my masters in Europe instead of the US (sponsorship for a masters is only available if you pursue it on a different continent to your undergrad). This is a major issue because I need to find a job/internship by the end of February (another stipulation for being allowed to work overseas for a year). This is a huge problem because at this point in time, I don't have any work experience or possess any past projects or experience in computer science. Despite a 4.0 GPA in college, I've been told by recruiters of a few big companies I've had a referral to that I lack the requisite experience and qualifications to interview for a job in data science. Being in Europe might also be a factor as I am not a US citizen although US work permits are significantly easier to obtain  for nationals from my country compared to others. I have a friend from the same major and same year in college who is currently pursuing his masters in data science at the same college who's already had an interview with Palantir while my online application was rejected within a day because ""do not have a position which currently matches (my) background and experience at this time"".

Despite my interest in quantitative subjects in school, I'd never actually done an internship or projects related to data science or computer science. I've also never recruited because I was guaranteed a job from my scholarship. As such I'm completely clueless as to what I should do it at this point in time. One option, could possibly work out, is to stall for time so that I can apply for internships and jobs in summer next year although I would not bet on it. Assuming that that is not an option, what would be your job-seeking advice to me? What kind of company would be interested in hiring me as an intern/full-time worker?

I have an ability to choose extra courses that focus on statistics, econometrics and math in themselves but I don't know if it is maybe better to instead take more courses that focus on practice with SAS, R, Python. It is probably not possible or very difficult to do everything due to limited time so I have to pick and choose extra subjects that will be the most beneficial for me. I will try to pick as many as I can. I think I will take at least one econometric subject for sure, to get a grip (bayesian econometrics, non linear econometric models, panel data econometrics?). Is it possible to learn enough about stats/econometrics just from practice in programming classes?


Anyway, do you think that my rather non-technical major will be a problem while applying for data science/analytics/big data jobs?
What should I focus on now, in your opinion?

I'm working on a template for a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration. This way it becomes a plug and play adventure rather than building it every time.

So far it has:

The Shape of the dataframe.

Describes the dataframe.

Types in the dataframe.

Pulls a sample.
Distoplots of variables.

Kurtosis and Skewness of variables.

Correlation Matrix.

Scatter Plots for Correlated variables.

What else would you suggest I throw in there? Once this thing is done I can link you all to it or post it or something.

Is there anything I should have to better explore categorical variables? Besides counts?

Thanks!

Looking for some career advice,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1510154383,True,"Hey guys,

I know y'all probably get questions like this on this sub all the time but I've tried to get advice from lots of different people and literally all of them claim to be unable to help me :(

I'm gonna try to keep it this short as possible and I'll add more details if people ask.

I'm from the Caribbean and can't wait to get out of here and move to a big city(no opportunities here, wages are sticky, corruption).
I have a BSc in Math and Econ, 2 years work experience and I'm a CFA level 3 candidate (finance qualification). I'm really interested in Business Analytics/Data Science but not sure if to pursue a Masters in China next year or self-study through MOOCs and books and then apply to a firm in a bigger city(US/Canada/Europe/Singapore) where more opportunities exist.

My Reasoning for and against MSc in China:

**Pros:**         
                                                                                                               
Easier to learn through formal education (for me)                               
Affordable!                                                      
I will be a awarded a Degree from the University of Liverpool (Somewhat Recognizable)                                                  
Opportunity to learn Mandarin and Chinese culture

**Cons (big cons IMO):**

Was considering purchasing a new laptop to do data work on. Inherited a nice iPad Pro that I have little use for.

Need advice to pick out the best plan (For Graduate School),2,3,False,False,False,datascience,1510328709,True,"Hello. 

I am a recent college graduate, and I studied Applied Mathematics in uni. Last year, I took two courses that changed my mind about hating Math/STEM as a whole. Data Mining and Time Series Analysis. I really enjoyed both, and got A's on both exams and did every single homework perfectly. I found myself enjoying working with data, and found it rewarding to understand the complex relationships between data and then analyzing them. I've always enjoyed knowing more about Finance and Economics, and mixing these two... I think I have found a future career for myself: Becoming a Data Engineer/Scientist/Analyst. The trouble is, I don't know what they do exactly. They are just words to me, because even reading around the web, it's like someone is just ""defining"" them. I also don't know any data scientists irl, so... I would like to hear from experts if the path I'm about to take is the correct one: 

I'm applying to graduate schools (free of charge), and there is no program offered titled ""Data whatever...""  (in my country) But, there's a subsection of an Industrial Engineering program, called ""Management Engineering"" and the course syllabus mentions Time Series Analysis and Data Analysis as two of the courses that must be taken. (Other courses are Marketing, a lot of Economics, Decision, Quality, system Eng,... )I think this is the best path for me. I do not want to study Math/CS or Statistics, because I do want a bit of a Business flair to things. My internships have proven to me that a knowledge of how things work in the real world is much better in the long run than being able to understand how things word on the lowest levels. 


I am going to graduate school, because I plan on applying for PhD positions later on, so this step is necessary. I just need to know if anyone knows anything about Engineering Management and its connection to work(of any kind, even research) in the field of Data.

Recruiters and Blacklists,12,21,False,False,False,datascience,1510334742,True,"Hi there, I'm hoping someone can send some light on my situation. I've been applying for DS/Analytics type roles for a few months now, which has been a bit of a harrowing experience. Atop the usual anxieties of underprepared-ness, I've been faced with some frustrating behavior of ghost recruiters and am curious if perhaps I'm on a blacklist. At least 5 times now, I've had a recruiter reach out and contact me, only to never again respond. I understand people are busy, forgetful, perhaps they find a more qualified candidate in the ~hour it may have taken me to respond. This seems to only happen to me with actual recruiting agencies, and never when going through internal recruiters. 

But even further, just this past week, I've had two recruiters schedule phone interviews with me to again only vanish without a word. Neither of them responding to my inquiry or attempt to reschedule. Is this indicative of someone on a blacklist? To me, it's strange if so, as I don't believe I've warranted it, and also would assume someone would check a name against a blacklist before an initial contact. To make matters (more?) confusing, one of the jobs I've just been ghosted on was just reposted to Indeed. Would applying again be a bad move?

On the other hand, I have an offer from P&amp;G as a data scientist in Cincinnati which to me is the more technical role. The people here are incredibly smart based on the impressions I got from interviewing. 

The P&amp;G job pays significantly more than the Nielsen job. However, opportunities for growth are much more clear in the Nielsen program. That's not to say P&amp;G doesn't have growth options. It's just that Nielsen painted a clear path.

Question(s) about going into the data science field,8,1,False,False,False,datascience,1510433367,True,"Good afternoon. I am not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit, but it's worth a shot.

I am a senior at a 4 year university. I have a major in psychology with a minor in statistics. I have a 4.0 GPA. In my coursework I am learning R, SAS, and SPSS. I am also working on a project that involves a massive data set to see if students that engage in mindfulness behaviors have higher GPA through mediation of several other variables. Emotionally, I want to be a clinical psychologist. However, that requires a Ph.D. in clinical psychology. For those who don't know, clinical psychology is an insanely hard field to get into. I am starting to question if the time and energy is worth it. Statistics and data science has really grown on me since starting my minor.  Plus data analysts seem to make a lot more money (I know that should not be a huge factor, but it is a factor none the less).  I have been entertaining the idea of going into data analytics.  I am actually taking a graduate level statistics course right now; the professor and I were chatting and she told me to send her my resume, her husband works at Capitol One and she said, he will see if he can potentially help me landing an internship.  However, I don't think a psychology background is going to look good to most employers.  During my last semester, I am thinking about taking other 500-600 level statistics courses to demonstrate my capabilities.

Can anyone give me advice on getting into the field?"

The requirement to switch is to simply take one of 3 stat classes and get a B- or higher.

In these 2 weeks, should I:
1) Brush up on my statistics, probability, and linear algebra, or
2) Read up on machine learning

I'm leaning toward option 1 since I believe once I start the bootcamp, I will be 100% focused on the machine learning stuff, but for now it would be best if I build some sort of foundation first so that I can absorb the machine learning material better during the bootcamp.

It's been tough, but I've been doing well. Also, I'm going to be doing a post-grad certificate course in DS fundamentals, starting Jan, to gain knowledge into SQL, ML, etc.  
I'm looking into Business Analyst job offers to begin, and then dive into more opportunities that are DS related. I'd really like to do a Masters in Data Science but I know I may have to start later than most people. 
I guess what I'm asking is, is it possible for someone that hasn't studied CompSci or graduated with that kind of degree for undergrad, to make it in the DS world? Is it possible to gain the knowledge from online and certificate courses and still be able to do well in this field?

Assuming I want to do math or statistics vs data science,  would it be better to do a MS in statistics or a MS in applied math?  I like applied math more purely for the interest of it,  but I think statistics is more relevant and more practical if I want to go the data science route.  Is that correct?  Applied math seems a bit broad too broad and it doesn’t focus my expertise as much.  Plus,  will hiring managers appreciate a masters in statistics or a masters in math?

Identifying semantic similarity in political speeches,7,7,False,False,False,datascience,1510624005,True,"Hey guys,

I'm working on a project to analyse the speeches of MPs in the UK parliament and I would like to be able to identify whether an MP is positive or negative about a particular topic/policy and whether two MPs are in agreement or disagreement based on their speeches. Has anyone worked on something similar before?

Here's an idea I have about how to do it but I'm not quite sure if it will work or not yet so I would appreciate some pointers/suggestions!

0. Use voting data to identify which pairs of MPs agree and disagree with each other on a particular topic most of the time.
0. Take speeches that they gave and pair them up, assigning labels based on whether they voted the same or differently.
1. Take a subset of this and correct it by hand. This becomes my validation set.
1. Use a [siamese BLSTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWjIoRNTCdU) with glove vectors trained on parliamentary speeches (?) to train a language model that predicts (dis)agreement. I can't just use simpler setups such sentiment analysis because obviously there are a lot of subtle differences in speech. Eg. ""We should develop renewable energy to the fullest extent"" and ""Coal is a terrible energy source"". The first sentence would have positive sentiment, whereas the second has negative sentiment, yet both are ""in agreement"" about environmental policy.

2. This is where I'm stuck. How would I do this for my whole corpus of speeches? Should I create a massive matrix of speech pairs for every topic and MP and use that to create a similarity matrix? Since this is politics, there is no baseline truth. All intentions are relative to other MPs...


If you have any alternative suggestions, I would love to hear them!

Hello all! Glad to have discovered this place!,0,4,False,False,False,datascience,1510658638,True,"Hello!  I’m currently making a leap into Data Science and am glad to have found this forum!  Already read a bunch of great info by scrolling through the front page!

Been working at it full time for 2-3 months so far (early days) and have got to grips with the theory and math of statistical methods up to and including multiple regression modelling/basic forecasting models.  I’ve got a strong grasp of R, which is growing intuitively and I’ve got to grips with SQL well enough to implement, query and manage a database using the language alone, again growing intuitively.

I’m coming into Data Science from a Music Analysis background and so I’m finding applying music theory concepts to databases and R language is really abstract and very enjoyable — it’s teaching me a lot about using the tools of the field in a very creative way!

So..
Hi all!  I look forward to joining the discussion!

I also try and keep a log of [pandas_profiles](https://github.com/JosPolfliet/pandas-profiling) for each dataset iteration to be able to see discrepancies between versions quicker.

I've developed two libsvm utilities,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1510685733,True,"So my question is whether this is a personal hack job or worth throwing up on github. If some people are interested, let me know.

I am a fairly average programmer. I have developed two utilities. One is in java. It can compile data dynamically and print it out either as libsvm or as csv. When it prints out as libsvm, it also prints out the feature names and label category names as well. It can also merge libsvm or csv files, it can save file parts and recompile later (if facing memory issues) and edit column values using regex.

The second is a scala/spark utility that wraps around an RDD[LabeledPoint]. This utility allows me to keep label and column names with the libsvm data so I can use them when printing out charts and results. It also lets me remove columns, calculate aggregate values for columns, reduce rows to the label by aggregate operations etc. And, it ties into the java utility (mentioned above)

I have run all of these functions on a dataset of 700000 rows and 3000 columns on my laptop with 8gb of RAM. It seems pretty fast.

So, are there utilities out there already that do this kind of thing, or is it worth refactoring this and sharing?"

Train/Test Split Sales Opportunities where Dates are Involved,1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1510687511,True,"I'm trying to better predict our company's revenue from our sales opportunities. I want to be able to both predict whether a sales opportunity will be closed-won (or closed-lost) and better predict the close date of the opportunity. Thus, I'm doing binary classification and regression (# of days since opportunity was created).

I've found features like the opportunity's current stage, # of days until expected close, and # of times the opp has changed in certain ways to be predictive.

However, I'm revisiting how I split the data into training and testing datasets. I know that if I randomly partition the opps then I can't trust my model evaluations on the test set; I want the testing dataset to mirror the realities of using these models in production. 

Instead, I've tried the following though I think this is biased in that my testing dataset ends up with opps with a shorter lifecycle:

Building up my training features dataset by filtering to opps that closed before a certain date, say `training_close_max &lt;- as.Date('2017-07-10')` and filtering my testing features dataset to opps that closed after the `training_close_max`, but before another date like `testing_close_max &lt;- as.Date('2017-10-30')`. The training and testing dataset predictors are similar except when it comes to # of days since created, where the testing dataset is shorter. To compound on top of this, the nature of the sales opportunities tend to change over time; I'd like to ideally train my models on the most recent sales opportunities that are most similar to our current open opps."

Keeping sharp while looking for work,1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1510877671,True,"I'm wondering what suggestions people have for keeping their skills sharp, and/or for picking up new ones as they search for work in this field (especially since there's so much, with new things to read about almost daily); with perhaps a little more focus on the time between graduation and first job. 

The obvious and general response here would be to search desired job listings, and brush-up/learn the skills required accordingly. Though this isn't always so easy, and the variance of skills/knowledge can be high (excluding the very obvious ones). There is also the issue of domain knowledge, of which one may not have any at all, let alone specific to the job applied to. Picking up on this can seem tough from the outside, especially to be up to date on current practices.

Perhaps someone can suggest some useful books/blogs/etc which would help those of us coming from a purely stats/analysis type of background to get used to certain domain spaces and the techniques there. Industries like Finance/Econ, Bio/Medical, Ad/Marketing, etc., seem to use familiar methods, but sometimes have rather unfamiliar nomenclature for them.

A bit about my background (if anyone would have some direct suggestions for me I'd be very appreciative): Masters in Stats, Bachelors in Math, have had some basic analytics work using google analytics, a short (1 semester) internship for a pharma company as a statistical consultant, quite good with R, intermediate with Python/SQL/SAS, familiar with most modern learning techniques.  I've tried to keep sharp by reading stats/ML books, learning/refreshing topics on youtube, testing out some tools in Kaggle comps. Despite this, I'm still quite nervous come every interview (there haven't been many).

How do machine learning models improve over time?,3,2,False,False,False,datascience,1510879773,True,"I keep reading about how machine learning models (particularly predictive models) can improve over time. I'm a little unclear about the mechanics for how this happens. Does a model improve simply because it accumulates more training data, or is it doing something more nuanced?
For example, let's say I train and validate a model on data from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Say the model predicts that an event will happen occur on Thursday. When Thursday rolls around, the event does not end up happening. How is the model retrained in order to make a prediction about Friday? Does it simply retrain itself from scratch, this time using an extra day's worth of data (Thursday's data)? Or does it flag Thursday's prediction as an error and then make efforts to figure out where it went wrong?

I'm a big fan of [Steven Wilson](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4X42BfuhWCAZ2swiVze9O0). I like his music a lot, and Spotify knows this so it recommends me similar songs. But their recommendations are not *good enough*. So, I'm using their API to solve this problem. I figured I could use a machine learning algorithm to get better recommendations.

[Question] Recommended method to split geo-spatial data into train/test?,4,1,False,False,False,datascience,1510916366,True,"Hi,

I did a quick search for ""geology"" and ""spatial"" but couldn't find this being discussed. My background in Data Science is mainly from financial crime - so moving into geology based problems is proving to be a challenge (a good one)

If you have many layers of information for a given area, say 100 square miles - you can create many data points by outputting an observation for every 250m or so in a grid fashion (likely using arcGIS or similar). 

My question relates to this: how to split this data into a train/test set? If you do it randomly it's likely that two points next to each other are virtually the same apart from minute differences so train data will leak into test - but if you split by area, it's likely that certain features will never get seen (what if that forest is entirely in the test set, for example).

I guess you could split the area up into larger chunks and randomly sample these (So on the whole, points next to each other stay in train or test and do not leak).

How to evaluate results of clustering algorithms in scikit-learn?,9,13,False,False,False,datascience,1510965796,True,"I am trying to learn data science in Python. One big issue I have is the following. Suppose I want to use a clustering algorithm from scikit-learn on my dataset--for the sake of argument, we will use the k-means clustering algorithm (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) on the Kaggle dataset Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).

Suppose my dataset has more than three attributes, so that I can't plot the clusters in three-dimensional Euclidean space. How do I evaluate the effectiveness of my clustering algorithm? (EDIT: for the sake of simplicity, all my attributes are assumed to be continuous, not categorical variables).

My understanding is that in R there are ways to quickly produce the 2D projections of the clusters. This can be misleading (since the low-dimensional projections of well-separated clusters in higher-dimensional Euclidean space can overlap) but it's at least something one can look at. Is there a similar functionality in scikit-learn?

There are also various metrics like the Dunn index which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of clustering algorithms, but AFAICT, this can get pretty hairy and leads one into active research fields in computer science.

What I want to know is, what does the working data scientist do in this situation to get a good feeling for how well the clustering algorithm is working?"

Member Get Member Growth Estimation,0,1,False,False,False,datascience,1511012859,True,"**Intro**

Each user (aka member) can invite a friend to become a user with his/her personal promo code.
When the friend become a user ( and provides the promo code during the on-boarding process) the system will grant 5€ each.

Each user can get up to 100€ via this process.

One year of data available.

**Business Question**

* Estimate the weekly growth of the number of users considering both new “organic” members and new members via the “Member get Member” process.
* Estimate the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for each user and the average.
* Allow a scenario simulation by changing some of the model parameters ( bonus amount, bonus maximum amount, average number of members invited, average number of inviters, … )

**Proposed Solution**

    Start in t=t0 with n=n0 current users.

    Get the state at t=t1 applying the following for each of the n(t-1) users:

      * 1)Each user dies with probability p(die|t=time_since_alive);
            p is taken by the historical distribution.

      * 2)If the user don’t die it has probability p(invite|t=time_since_alive) to invite other members;
            p is taken by the historical distribution.

      * 3)Update bonus for each user.

When should you build multiple sub-models vs just one (x-post from Machine Learning) q,1,14,False,False,False,datascience,1511024860,True,"Are there any good heuristics for when one should think about partitioning your data based on some feature and then building models on each partition rather than training a single model on the full data set? Particularly for something like xgboost or tree based models.

The way I sort of think about it is that if a particular partition of the data has different behaviour to another then the trees will just split on that characteristic and then build their own sub models from there. If I partition the sample then train models on the partitions then I can think of it as a larger tree where I've forced the first split on the model.

One hypotheses I have is that if there's one feature where I expect the generating process to be wholly different dependent on the feature then maybe it's worth building different models. For instance if I have the same types of customer demographic info for an electronics store and a real estate company and want to predict likelihood to buy electronics or real estate I should probably build a separate model for the real estate company and the electronics store."

Not to mention that the data is quite sparse since they have all kinds of products. Similar products do not necessarily have similar sales.

How should I approach learning Data Science?,10,16,False,False,False,datascience,1511122972,True,"**My Background**

I work full time as a web developer at an advertising agency, and have been programming professionally for 4 years.  I've always been mathematically inclined, and I'm comfortable learning things from textbooks.

I'd like to transition to a data science role, and I'd like to know the best way to approach that.

The biggest catch is that I didn't complete my undergraduate degree, which I expect will be an obstacle in getting positions in the future.

So as I see it...

**Pros**

- 4 years of programming experience
- Experience with data visualization libraries in Javascript
- Experience with functional programming styles in Javascript
- Some on and off tinkering in R over 2 years
- Comfortable reading scientific studies
- Comfortable reading technical docs

**Cons**

- Incomplete university degree in unrelated field (Commerce)
- No scientific credibility


**What to learn?**

I read through a university of toronto, 'interested in data science' page, which detailed a number of important courses to take for statistics majors interested in data science.  Listed were...

**Required**

- Methods of Data Analysis I and II (STA302H1, STA303H1), 
- Design of Scientific Studies (STA305H1), 
- Theory of Statistical Practice (STA355H1), and 
- Statistical Methods for Data Mining and Machine Learning (STA414H1).  

**Recommended**

- Statistical Computation (STA410H1)
- Statistical Methods (STA437H1 and STA442H1)
- Theory and Methods for Complex Spatial Data (STA465H1) 
- Fundamentals of Statistical Genetics (STA480H1)

**The Big Idea**

If I pickup the textbooks for those 8 courses, and work through them, completing any exercises therein, then that would likely take about 500-800 hours of effort.

If on top of that, I get more serious with my study of R, and slowly work through Hadley's Advanced R, and perhaps a similar book on Python, that might add another 120 hours.

But even after extensively learning the material in the stats textbooks, and honing my programming in R and Python, I'll still have the problem of credibility.

**Credibility**

What does credibility look like to those hiring for data science positions?

Are there indicators of credibility aside from the Undergraduate/Masters/PhD that I could leverage to get a position? 

- A history of success in leading teams on Web development projects?
- A 12 week bootcamp?
- Project examples on Github?  
- A blog with 15-20 in-depth case studies?

If I want to spend 1000 hours over the next 3 years making this transition happen, what things should I change about this approach, and is this a realistic time frame and estimation of effort?

**What Alternative Approaches Should I Consider?**

Are there any data-science adjacent positions that are more programming heavy?  If I was extremely proficient in R or Python, but didn't have a super deep statistics background (Hypothetically, let's say I read and understand ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" but don't go further), are there data-science type positions that would allow me to play an important role on a team?"

My company purchased Alteryx and I have no experience in statistics. Is there any hope for me?,4,6,False,False,False,datascience,1511131648,True,"Hello,

I do reporting using SQL, C#, VBA, SSRS, Qlik Sense and other similar applications.  I've also used SSAS a while ago to build cubes and I familiar with SSIS.  

My company has recently purchased Alteryx and it looks to be pretty amazing. My new mission is to use Alteryx to answer questions like, ""if a certain group hasn't gotten a raise in a while, what are the chances they will turnover?"" or ""is there a correlation between people taking courses and going into management?"". I'm sure there a many more to come. 

The problem is I don't know statistics beyond doing an average. Going through Alteryx is pretty overwhelming as far as the prediction/analysis part of it.  I find it fascinating and would really love to learn it, but I don't know where to begin.

There is some training I've found online, with Alteryx, and a bunch Youtube videos. But it seems to me that I could learn to use the software, but if I don't have an understanding of what it is really doing, I won't be able to make the proper use of it. Sort of like learning music software, but not being able to read music.

I did start a Lynda course on basic Statistics but I still feel that I am very far away from understanding this stuff. Despite my job (and Masters in C.S.) I am not a ""math person."" I'm not sure if that matters or not.

Can you please recommend some online (or other) training that would be useful? 

Do you think unless I go back to school to get a degree in data science, am I going to be hopelessly lost?

Thank you for the help!

edit: I just realized that some others have asked a very similar question (within a few hours ago!). I think mine is a little different by the fact I am already employed and have over 15 years experience (not with data science, obviously) and this is a shift that my department is trying to make."

"Starting a project for my stats class, need pointers for gathering data and if my regression model makes sense",2,1,False,False,False,datascience,1511159770,True,"This isn't supposed to be super in-depth since this is an Economic Stats class that is required for many majors at my university and all of our work is done in Excel, but the professor allows us to use R and/or Python if that makes our lives easier, and I do want to use a fair bit of those languages to gain more experience anyway. More importantly, I do want to ace this project and even MORE importantly, I want to publish the finished product on my github to show to recruiters.

TOPIC: Researching the various factors that affect auto insurance premium rates, and figuring out on average how much minors (drivers below the age of 20) pay vs. adults (drivers 20 and over) pay. 

Regression model: Y(Auto Insurance Rates) = β0 + β1(annual mileage) + β2(number of previous accidents) + β3(pop. density of area of residence) + β4(age) + β5(credit score) + β6(vehicle safety rating) + β7(vehicle age) + β8(marital status -&gt; if yes = 1,  if no = 0) + β9(gender) + β10(vehicle size) + Error term 

After quick research, I expect the first 3 independent variables to have a positive effect on predicted Y, the next 5 variables to have a negative effect, and the last 2 to have an uncertain effect. 

There's a lot of specific information to gather here and I have no clue where to go from here. Am I supposed to call up a big auto insurance firm and ask for their data? I am looking for at least 100 (hell, 1000 would be even better probably) observations/individuals that have all of this information, if there is some data missing I'm sure I can take care of that with R or Python. Obviously I hope it doesn't come to that."

I'm a mechanical engineering graduate.  I have recently convinced my job that it would be beneficial for me to go back to uni for a masters to help with more advanced projects.  I want to work in Data Science/Machine learning, and I've found some degrees on the subjects, but a friend who is a CS masters holder informed me that it would probably be best to get a computer science masters and then to focus the elective courses on Machine learning/data science.  That way I get a good grounding in all of CS and still get some Data science courses.  

The courses in data science tend to be modules focusing solely on one type of learning/analysis at a time.  For example, Applied Bayesian Methods, Advanced Topics in Machine Learning, Machine Vision ect.  I have seen information on all of this online and figure that for the focused items I could find that information readily available online and be able to study up on that independently.  

What do you all think of this?  Is it better to go for a fully rounded computer science masters (since Im coming from Mechanical Engineering) and focus on the data science parts independently, or to go right in for a masters in data science?

Thank you all for any assistance!

I am 37, and have been a professional touring musician/music teacher (private/group lessons, no degree) for the past 20 years. i got tired of the music business and decided to go back to school to pursue a degree in mathematics. My full degree will be a BA in mathematics, minor in statistics, and a concentration in statistics and operations research. when i complete school in spring/19, i will also have completed a certificate in data analysis. I am constantly searching job postings to make sure i will have all my bases covered when i hit the job market. I am fascinated with the potential for big data in curing disease and generally in the power, in the volume of data generated today. 

My main questions are these...
Will this degree suffice and how will I compare to other job seekers?
What can I do to make myself more marketable?
Should i be looking for an “entry level” position? If so, what type of companies should i be looking at?
Im also looking for some advice and guidance along the way as i enter a new field with what i should be doing to get to where i want to be.

Has anyone had experience building Data Quality Monitoring System w/ Machine Learning?,2,4,False,False,False,datascience,1511198673,True,"Hello /r/datascience ,

I am a relative novice to the data science world. One of my current projects is to design a data quality monitoring system.

Now, to take it to the next level, I would like to incorporate a machine learning Python based solution to make the data quality monitoring 'smart'. 

I am currently by no means proficient in machine learning, which is where some of my time is being devoted to learning. Additionally, I do not have anyone on my team with whom I can consult with on this matter. Does anyone have experience building out such a full-fledged 'smart' data quality monitoring system that  I could chat with to help brainstorm or get some guidance? Will gladly accept any direction to resources that could assist with this.

Thank you for reading and considering!"

Need guidance balancing and focusing my self study curriculum,5,3,False,False,False,datascience,1511203881,True,"I've been lurking around this sub for a couple months now.  At this point I consider myself just past the stage of ignorance; I know what I don't know and I've started plotting out the resources I will need to know it.  I've read just about every reddit guide and website curriculum (like elitedatascience etc) but now I am looking to solidify a plan that best suits my needs.


What I need help with is:

(1) prioritizing the order of my studies and 

(2) maximizing the efficiency of the time I spend studying.  

I am not looking for a ""6 months to data science track"" for obvious reasons, but I also can't take on 10 super-thorough-6-month-long MOOC's that overlap in what they teach or I'll never hit my goals.  So basically, **what should I focus on first, what should I save for later, and what subjects are good to learn in tandem?**


**Some background about myself:**

-  BS in Finance and Information Systems (double major)
-  MBA w/ concentration Finance
-  7 years experience as a Businesss Analyst/Product Developer/Project Manager, primarily in FinTech 
-  Currently working for a small startup with a team of data scientists.  Job responsibilies include finding/cleaning/storing their data, running and QAing their models, and working with development teams to automate these tasks.
	-  I have expressed intrest in learning more about data science and they have encouraged me down this path.

**My skillset and self ratings:**

-  Translating business requirements (5/5)

-  SQL (4/5)

-  Python (2/5)

-  Statistics (2/5)(Would say 3, but I realize I'm talking to real statisticians here)

-  Data gathering/cleaning/elementary data analysis (2/5)(would say 4/5 by manually using SQL and Excel, but I am trying to take this to the next level; ie automation, prediction, and re-usable tools)

**Steps I've taken (a bit scattered):**

-  Learning Python (on and off the past year, much more focused the past several months)

	-  Resources : Automate the Boring Stuff, Absolute Beginner's Guideto Python, checkIO for practice, some on the job practice, and pet projects (NFL stats or whatever RPG I'm playing)

	-  Focusing not only on getting things done, but on how to get things done in a pythonic fashion.

-  Data Science from Scratch as a syllabus.  

	-  Using this to get from 0 to 1.  Great handbook for basics.

-  Started the first few chapters (or lessons) of: 

    -  Think Stats - not sure I like the format and all the extra work you have to do to even use the book

	-  Linear Algebra videos/lessons - I've got the absolute [basics down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab), but I'm sure I need more

	-  Introduction to Statistical Learning - Realized I needed some more math refreshers first.  Also self conscious about jumping into R without a firm enough grasp on python

	-  Machine Learning class by Andrew Ng - Got through week 3 but feel like I need to refresh my maths first or I'll be getting too ahead of myself.
		
**Next Steps I'm mulling over:**

-  Full computer science intro?

	-  I'm getting a good handle on Python but am not sure if I should complete something like CS50 or if that is overkill.

-  Take a full Statistics course or a refresher?

	-  I know down the road I will need more and more advanced stats, for now I need to focus on what I'll need to get started.

	-  I know regression, multiple regression, ANOVA tables, and some more from quantitative finance classes.  But could stand to refresh these topics.

	-  I don't know Bayes and am not sure when the best time to learn this will be.

	-  The [Duke class](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) is supposed to be great, but I am not sure if I need a 6 month long Statistics program.

-  Full Linear Algebra course or stick with the basics until I need more?

	-  Have heard both points argued, not sure which I should pursue.

	-  Course options are [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) or [Harvard](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)

-  Single and Multivariate Calculus

	-  Need a refresher for single (haven't looked at it in 10 years) I hear Khan Academy is good, I also just dug up my old textbook.

	-  Never learned multivariate

		-  How important is this?  Should I take a full class or focus on the basics for now?  Again, I've heard Khan Academy is good.

-  Machine Learning 

	-  [Introduction to statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) or [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) class or both?

		-  Both are highly touted and from what I've seen in both's introductors classes they are very well tought.  

-  [Harvard's CS109 Data Science Class](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html)

	-  Are classes like this too general or would this be a good course to take?
		
**Down the Road for later (I know I'm not there yet):**

-  More and more stats

-  Essentials of Statistical Learning (I can only hear it refered to as the bible so many times)

-  Neural Networks

-  AI

-  Big Data (Hadoop/Spark)

-  Natural Language Processing

**Conclusion:**  

I have done a lot of research on what I will need to know and have started or tried out a bunch of material.  I've weened out plenty sources of I need help focusing my effort

Career Advice: Contract vs. Full-Time,23,3,False,False,False,datascience,1511226287,True,"Hey guys and gals, 

I am three weeks out from graduating with my masters in data analytics and have been applying for a few positions around the country including my home town. 

I'm currently working as a Financial Analyst using mostly excel and some trading platforms so I've been looking for a role that utilized some of the skills we developed in the program such as SAS, R, Python, SQL, and Tableau. 

My current role pays ~$62K plus the benefits of a Fortune 100 company. Other perks include an on-site gym and a size-able bonus, I should expect $7K at minimum this year. We have your typical 5.5% 401K match as well $500 credit towards an HSA if you contribute to one.  

I currently have a contract position available to me that is exactly what I am looking for. Title would be ""Data/Business Solutions Analyst"". The position is a 1 year+ contract with potential for extension and/or conversion. Compensation is $40/ hour or $80K annually with a 2 week vacation. No PTO and 401K match doesn't kick in until after a year. 

I'm hesitant to get into a contract position because I know I could find a full-time job somewhere if I explored more options. From what I understand the conversion rate is relatively high so I doubt I would be a contract employee for the entire year. 

Now, if I back out all of the benefits I have in my current role from the contract position the math looks something likes this: 

Type | $$ |
:--|:--|
Offered Salary:|$80,000|
Bonus:|$7,000|
401K Match:|$3,421|
HSA Contribution:|$500|
Gym:|$500|
Left Over:|$68,579|
Current Salary:|$62,220|
Pay ""Increase"":|$6,379|


The only thing I am missing is the difference in the cost of medical insurance I am paying now and what it would cost from the contract company but that wouldn't total up to $6K right? 

Any other advice or input would be greatly appreciated.

Master degree in business intelligence and data mining. Currently writing thesis about how to detect outliers/anomalies in high-dimensional data in order to improve clustering results. For detecting outliers, I've come across early stages of statistical test before moving on to data mining techniques such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF), DB-outlier, Local Integral Outlier Detection (LOCI), Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD) and Subspace Outlier Degree (SOD) among others. 

For clustering I intent to use hierarchical clustering and K-means and evaluate the outlier detection methods from the perspective of improvement for sum of squared error (SSE). "

Advanced Excel Functions:
-Pivot Tables
-VBA Scripting

Fundamental Statistics:
 -Modeling
 -Forecasting

Python Programming:
-Python 3
-NumPy
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-API Interactions
-Social Media Mining

I have a B.Sc. in Pure Math - Where should I go from here to get a job in Data Science (Machine Learning)?,6,1,False,False,False,datascience,1511310934,True,"I'll be getting a B.Sc. in pure math in a few months from a Canadian University (UofT).

Should I pursue graduate studies in Pure or Applied Math? Or rather in Statistics/CS? If the latter, I only have beginner courses in programming and probability under my belt, so should I study a bit on my own and try to apply only then?

How about Data Science/Analytics degrees? Are they worth it? If so, which Canadian programs do you recommend for them? (Not really interested in US programs as they tend to be expensive for international students, unless someone knows a good one that's relatively inexpensive).

Or would it be better to just learn on my own from Books/MOOCs/Videos? If so, approximately how long do you think self-learning would take?

"Is a Master's necessary for the actual experience and intuition, or just to meet the requirements that employers look for?",13,3,False,False,False,datascience,1511311227,True,"Let's say you have a B.S. and  (theoretically) in-depth knowledge on ML and algorithms, and instead of spending another 1-2 years in school, you work an analytics role using your ML skills and apply that to your company's projects and even your own passion/research stuff. Okay maybe not IN-DEPTH knowledge since that's kinda unrealistic while getting a standard math/econ/stats/physics Bachelors especially if you're not a CS degree, sure you can spend all of your free time reading and learning about it but I imagine the intuition is just scratching the surface.

I am a game developer who has recently taken up the role of data analyst in my company. However, as I am still learning on the topic, there are a lot of things that I still don't know about.

Currently I have a question regarding finding correlation.

I have a time series of sales data for our game, recorded in weeks. During each of these weeks we hosted a event in the game with a top reward. This reward has different traits and properties, such as being a resource/unit/building/belongs to a faction etc...

What I want to find out is, are there any correlation between the traits and properties of the reward and the rise/drop in sales. i.e. Does a certain type of reward makes more people want to spend money during the event.

Is that possible to test for? Most time series resources I found online talks about forecasting, but there ain't anything that talks about testing for dependency with another variable.

An idea that I have is to diff the time series of sales to get a stationary series, and then perform a chi-squared test to see if a certain trait/property causes more rises/drops than the expected value. But I am not sure if that is even the correct way to do it.

Please let me know if I have any misconceptions about the analysis. Thank you for reading through the post!"

Is there any place on the web to find working gigs for a data science enthusiast or an entry level data scientist?,2,5,False,False,False,datascience,1511365469,True,"Hi r/datascience,

I am somewhat new to the world of data science, but I do feel that I have made a good start. I am doing good with Python since I started it a couple of months ago and I realistically feel that my future lies in data science. I have a good educational background in statistics and I own a Masters degree too, with plenty of experience around business and social research.

However, until just a few months ago, my primary career line was freelance writing. But to be honest, I have confidently felt over the past year that it's not a career line with a very promising outlook. I am currently handling a few major online translation projects and it will be able to let me survive for a couple of months. So now I am thinking about fast tracking my data science learning process and completing a few good online courses. But, I do fear that sooner or later, I will go back to the really frustrating pursuit of finding average to low pay writing gigs as the bills begin to pile up.

But I have been exploring the idea of finding entry level freelance gigs that a data science enthusiast like me can start off with. I would rather prefer working in low-to-average pay entry level data science jobs now, than move back to freelance writing. I think I could do even better by working with an experienced data scientist, like maybe become some sort of an online apprentice. As of now, the scope for data science around my country is fairly low and only a few businesses are actually aware about it. The future maybe different, but I don't see many promising office desk jobs coming over here in that sector anytime soon.

**So, I was just wondering if folks at r/datascience could let me know about sites on the web, where I could find the most basic online entry level data science jobs and move forward in the sector. I am fairly good at graphics designing (including infographics), video making and audio creation, in addition to my 4 year long experience in writing: can I also market those skills to any professional data scientist? (if yes: let me know the places to go)**

Data is the closest thing we have to a real world application of truth, and the world is a better place when decisions are made with care. 

Now that you know why you should become a data scientist, here is a simple guide to becoming one. 

**Prerequisites:**

**Math**: You can honestly get really far with little math. That being said, there are far too many people who don't understand the math and end up using analysis techniques with little forethought into why they should be using that model. I will say this much: The more math, the better off you are. It is a beautiful field and directly relevant to you if you want to make the most of your foray into data science. 

Beginner: High school algebra, maybe some calculus 1, high school statistics

Intermediate: College stats, Calc 1,2,3, Probability Theory, linear algebra, Statistical Inference

Advanced: Upper undergrad / Grad level statistical inference, bayesian inference, harder probability theory, linear optimization, convex optimization, real analysis, calculus of variations. Math is the limiting factor, remove those obstacles. Learn all the advanced math you can muster.

Reccs: khanacademy if you've never seen the content. MIT OCW has really great self paced math courses for calc 1-3, linear algebra and much more. Eventually you will want to learn the art of grinding through math textbooks while doing problems. **The only way to learn math is by doing math. Practice, practice, practice.**

If you want to be a true OG, here is Michael I. Jordan's reading list for prospective grad students in ML: 

[Mike I. Jordan ML Books](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1055389)

**Programming**

Pick up a language and stick with it for now. It is far easier to pick up a second language once you are very good at one than it is to slowly work through being mediocre at a bunch of languages. 

People live and die by their language of choice for some reason. Generally, my thoughts on this are the following:

R is fantastic. R is great for data analysis, and if you use the tidyverse, R is great for everything else too. R is an **organically grown** language that is not always lexically consistent, so it can be a bit quirky. Due to the community of statistics researchers that use R, generally you will find the most bleeding edge packages on R. R will make you think like a statistician.

Python is great for taking your data a bit farther. It has packages which provide most of the functionality you would need from R. Python is a great choice because it has many more varied packages and capabilities related to software development. Python is a broad, general purpose language that is beautifully **designed** and consistent. This will make you think more like a programmer.

Over a career, it is wise to know as many tools well as you can. Since you will spend a good amount of time writing code, you should strive to learn both at some point. 

Alrighty, now onto the core stuff. 

**How to:**

**1. Get Data**

This can be done by scraping, downloading a data set, building a data set, making a survey, whatever. There is a lot of data floating around and there are plenty of resources for learning how to scrape. Since data is usually stored in data bases in the real world, it is wise to learn a bit about data bases. Learn some SQL. Since we live in the age of big data, it would also be wise to learn non-relational database query languages like nosql and postgresql

Some good spots for data: /r/datasets, kaggle, data.gov

**2. Clean it**

Remember: garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the data is the foundation of all your work from here on out. Check out a book or a course that will take you from these early stages into actually playing with the data. For python, [Harvard CS109](https://github.com/cs109/content) does this. It also have video lectures. For R, Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at RStudio) has a bunch of amazing books out. Check out [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511408512&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=r+for+data+science) . It wouldn't hurt to eventually read a book on data cleaning and data interpolation.

**3. Take some time to familiarize yourself with your data**

What kind of variables are there? Quantitative (numbers)? Categorical / Qualitative (Labels)? Text? Images?
 Geographical? The types of data present will determine what can be modeled. 

Its a good idea to look at the data in list form and plot it out using R or python or excel or whatever. If using other types of data (eg images, geographical), then find the best ways to visualize the data. Now would be a good time to learn about knitr and rmarkdown if using R and jupyter notebooks if using python. 

This is the time to do some *descriptive statistics.* Look at the way the data flows on the plots. What relationships do you think are there? Are there any outliers? Plot, plot, plot, and plot some more. Make the plots look good. Check out ggplot2 in R or matplotlib / seaborn in python. 

Learn to dissect your data. Check out feature engineering. Learn to combine data sets to expand what can be done.

If you want to be a true OG, learn some graphic design principles. Learn to use blank space and color. There is nothing more influential than a beautiful graph.

**4. Figure out the questions you want to ask**

This is perhaps the hardest part. The questions you ask will determine what you find in the data. When thinking about questions, ponder proactively about what techniques you would use to answer them. This is where a broad set of modeling tools comes handy. That will be gone over in the next section.

**5. Analysis**

The most satisfying part in my opinion. When you wrote out your questions, hopefully you have some idea of what techniques you would use. That said, there are a lot of techniques to choose from and each technique has its own special niches. You will learn to select models properly from seeing a lot of data and practicing. Like everything else, practice, practice, practice. Try many models, run them on test sets using cross validation and see what works best. Learn about bias-variance trade-off. 

Generally statistical analysis is broken into 2 parts: 

In descriptive statistics we want to describe the patterns and structure of the data. If you did part 3 well, this will be partially taken care of. You can expand on this as the analysis comes along. 

In inferential statistics we want to predict from the data. This is what we are at now. 

Broadly speaking, this is the content that seems to be spread around the most. I will post some reccs to different courses / books that you will see floating around this subreddit (because they are great).

**Make sure you learn and understand cross validation extremely well.**

**Make sure to understand the assumptions behind each modeling technique you use. There is no one size fits all technique.** 

Since this is such a broad topic, go learn data analysis from books and courses. Learn models, figure out why you would want to use them, and then apply them. 

Once you have completed your modeling, make sure to create a visualization. If others will be seeing it, learn to explain things in simple terms as if non experts will see it. When you are being paid to be a data scientist, it is not about how intelligent you come across, it is about results and understanding for everyone.

Any other data analysis book you can find. 

**6. The Great Beyond**

After step 5, you are essentially a (good) data analyst. What will differentiate you now will be the extras. Heres some other stuff that you should probably look into: 

* Databases: SQL / Nosql / any query language really. 

* Data Engineering: Create pipelines and automate a lot of the legwork to make raw data usable. 

* Shell: Linux is cool, and bash scripting is useful

* Hadoop, Mapreduce, Spark, AWS, etc: Big Data

* Deep Learning : See what the hype is all about

* Time series analysis: Given the ubiquity of time series data, a book on TSA can't hurt

* Computer Science: Learn CS rigorously. Check out Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, CLRS Algorithms, Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming, and more. If you learn the concepts underlying the technologies you see, you won't be outdated nearly as easily. Tools may change, but the concepts and math stay the same. 

* Learn to love practicing. This list is daunting, but it is completely achievable one small step at a time. Setting aside time to learn and practice daily will get you farther than you could ever imagine. 



**Guide to Learning**

Like all other things in life, there are exciting things and less exciting things. What you find exciting is unique to you, but for the sake of this guide I will give how I would learn the content (assuming you know basic maths and programming): 

* Learn some data analysis. If using python, think stats is nice. If using R, R for Data Science is nice
* Learn how to clean and dissect data. If you read one of the books in the bullet above, you will have learned this.
* Now learn some visualization. Make it pretty with a book on ggplot or seaborn/matplotlib
* Now learn some better tools for analysis: Read and work through Intro to Statistical Learning or Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. Ideally you would do both. 
* Learn database query languages. You will come across databases, so its best to be a wizard with them. 
* Learn hadoop / map reduce / spark for big data
* Learn the theory on a deeper level. [Probability Theory](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) is great, Statistical Inference is great, Bayesian Inference and multilevel modeling is great. 
* Never stop learning

"No background in Math/Stat or Programming, still want to join Data Science? Then Read Through..",14,32,False,False,False,datascience,1511524619,True,"Quite often I see a lot of people on Reddit or elsewhere with common questions:

*	I have couple of years of experience not related to this field, I am a Marketing Manager/HR/etc… Can I make a shift to Data Science?  

*	Which language is popular R, Python, Matlab, SAS? Do I need to know all of them? Which one should I pick up first?  


So before we answer these, a brief background about me.   
Yes, I graduated in Mathematics (Just rote learned the theorems and solved some algebra &amp; calculus, don’t remember anything now!) and there after pursued MBA in Finance. Only time I ever did programming was when I was an 8th grader, and back then at school we used BASIC (How many of you even know there was a language called BASIC?). After that, I only saw computers during my MBA, and all I used was MS Power Point for some shabby presentations and Torrents to watch movies!  

 
Today, I am leading an India based sell-side Quants desk of one of the largest Investment Banks in the world. By leading, I don’t mean just people management, that’s just 10% of my time, and rest is actually Quantitative Research, apart from building several models, I have built 4 custom packages in R (though can’t distribute that outside as they belong to my company now). I started my career in 2008 when I joined a sell side equity research house, but was forced to join Quants desk, just because I had Maths in my CV, about which I hardly knew anything. Though, I was not happy initially, as I actually wanted to analyze stocks and come up with Buy-Sell recommendations, but now I feel that was the best thing that could have happened to me. Things were not as smooth as for my other friends who joined the field in which they had studied, moreover I’ve hardly coded anything after my 8th grade, however, I enjoyed my journey, picked up SQL, VBA, OLAP &amp; R along with Quants! And now I am considered a subject matter expert in this field, almost every week  I get a call from a head-hunter to consider Quants/Data Science position in other organizations.  


So long story short – if I can, why can’t you? I see myself in the shoes of most people putting these questions. So here is some piece of advice for you, take it if you like it, else there are many other interesting things to read!  


Firstly, stop asking and put your energy into action. Don’t just consider data science as it’s a fad today and everyone is being talking about it, consider it only if you are passionate about it. And you’ll get to know that only when you get into action. Moreover, remember, nothing is permanent, yesterday it was IT, today it’s Data Science, and tomorrow may be something else. However, the passionate coders of yesterday are doing much better because of their passion!  

  
Which language should I pick? I’d say pick any popular one plus the one that has tremendous help/online community. Both R and Python are very good and at par from data analysis perspective, Python however goes much beyond as you can use it for full software development, build applications etc. But who cares, you need to know these for data analysis and Machine Learning, and both are equally good. Instead of hopping around with several languages I’d say stick to one, master it, and then you may explore others. When I interview candidates, though our infra is in R, I don’t put that as a necessary condition, anyone familiar with this field would agree, that if you are good in Python, you’ll easily pick up R and vice-versa. Further top it up with SQL &amp; VBA. SQL because you would be working with huge datasets and mostly, they would be stored in databases rather than Excel. VBA because, it helps a lot in automation and post production activities, plus because of its Macro – Recording feature, it’s very easy to pick up!  


I know nothing about complex Math/Stat and don’t think can easily pick it too? – Who cares, remember this field looks quite glamorous from outside, and if you think you would be building Machine Learning models every day in your life, sorry to disappoint you. Almost 95% of your time would be on data cleansing, analyzing, and feature extraction. Plus as long as you know the working of a Machine Learning model and how to interpret that output, which again can be learned without involving the complex maths, you have ready packages to implement these. Always remember, even a 10th grader can run a RandomForest or SVM or Neural Network, as you have them packaged already, so what you are paid for is to analyze the data and do feature extraction. I would say, as a data scientist, your life is like a soldier – “Years of boredom and few Days of excitement”  


Lastly and most importantly, don’t consider everything for an immediate gain. People typically whether I’ll get a job in data science after this. Sorry to be rude, but, “Dude, you are investing in yourself and not doing anyone a favor. Moreover you’ve gone this far, because you said you are passionate about this field”. Not everything is liked to money directly, but trust me, if you do it properly it pays off in the long term. Moreover, even if you are working in a non-data science environment, there’s so much data around your current job too and you may add so much value and excitement to your current job by picking up these skills!   


I still remember, back in 2010, I was associated with an institute as a part time faculty for CFA exams, apart from my regular job. Once they suddenly requested me to take up session of their newly launched Business Analytics classes in SAS. I had never seen SAS before, but took up the challenge – spent Wednesday night reading “The Little Book of SAS” &amp; Thursday &amp; Friday night practicing it. After all, by then I was comfortable in R so it was just a change in syntax for me. And delivered the session on Saturday &amp; Sunday and recorded the highest ever feedback points from students! Thereafter I developed passion for this field and Invested a lot of time in learning different models and analysis techniques! Did it help me immediately in my job – NO. However, it paid off in other ways, I was the most sought after faculty for Analytics, I was paid 3X compared to other part-time faculty, in some months, I’ve seen my income from these part-time activities to be more than that from my regular job! I even went on to start my own online analytics training academy! Since then I’ve seen quite a lot of my students joining Analytics field from a non-analytics background.  


Now, I don’t want this post to be a self – promotion exercise, and hence I am not putting the name of my training academy here, but if anyone is interested can ask for the same in comments  


So, what are you waiting for – stop asking and get into action my dear friends!

Searching unkwown consensus sequences,0,2,False,False,False,datascience,1511526761,True,"Hello guys!

I’m looking for a software that can find unknown consensus sequences between some promoters regulated from the same transcriptional factor.
I’ll try to explain my problem in details:
We are studying a transcriptional factor and we know that the deletion of this gene causes the deregulation of some other genes.
We think that this transcriptional factor binds a common consensus sequence on the promoters of the deregulated genes but we don’t know anything about this consesus. We just know that, probably, there is a common consensus sequence in these promoters.
Now what we want to do is to allineate our promoters sequences to find some short (6-12 bp) common sequences that could be the transcriptional factor consensus.

Turning Reccomender systems or Association Rules into actionable data,0,0,False,False,False,datascience,1511543918,True,"I have been researching this for awhile. It has been tough going, because of most the research in this field has to do with web data or direct mail marketing.

1. Recommender Systems:  using item based  and user base collaborative filtering, Ii could possibly turn the similarity scores into a list of top opportunities of customers that arent buying products with similarity scores.

2. Association Rules:  It's easy to get association rules. But, turning them into actionable data is a bit harder.  I have seen some research building association rules into regressions or bayes networks to segment or score customers.  Seems really yinteresting, but limited research for me to go off

I am asking in general terms in hopes that the answers in this thread may be relevant to whoever else comes across this in a later search.

&amp;nbsp;

Personally, I have BS in Math and Stats and have worked with R and Python. I'm looking to get a decent grasp of machine learning / data science before looking for employment in about 6 months.

I am considering taking the following 3 courses:

&amp;nbsp;

**Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera** 

I think this will give me a good introduction into machine learning. It seems to be recommended very often.

&amp;nbsp;

**Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla on Udemy**

This would give me experience with python that was lacking in the previous course.

&amp;nbsp;

Not sure as to what the last course should be. Perhaps Machine Learning Specialization from University of Washington on Coursera? Or a Deep Learning course?

I'll appreciate any one else's input / recommendations!"

Draft version of my data science learning path (is it good?),21,50,False,False,False,datascience,1511697398,True,"First of all, I want to assure you that I have done my homework and read a large number of similar ""I wanna be a data scientist. But how?"" topics. This is where I found about numerous resources and books that can be used to study the field. Even though now I have an exhaustive list of resources, I would also like to prioritize them and outline a sequence in which to learn the materials. In addition, some fragments of my plan might be totally wrong or inaccurate, so I would appreciate any kind of advice and recommendations. 

I. Learning Python (since I already have some experience in Python programming, I have decided to stick Python. I'm not even an intermediate Python programmer yet, but I try to learn things on the go. The Python tutorial is of great help.

-- Sometimes I also look through Python Cookbook and Fluent Python to get at least moderately familiar with the best practices for pythonistas. 

Questions:

1. Is it reasonable to stick with just Python? Or should I also get familiar with R?

2. Is it enough to be moderately fluent in Python without knowing the ins and outs?

II. Learning the math

I have a basic command of calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics. Yet, I'm afraid that my knowledge is rather fragmented and I should seriously brush up on linear algebra and statistics. 
There are so many books on the subjects. I have chosen the following:

 - Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra
 - OpenIntro Statistics
 - Probability by Ross to review the basics
 - ISLR (not exactly a textbook to learn statistics, but a very good source of information for the applications)

Questions:

1. Are the sources outlined above exhaustive enough to cover the fundamentals of the math necessary for learning data science and machine learning and understand the algorithms and methods used?

III. The basics of data science

I have come to the conclusion that it could be useful to read a less technical book on what data science deals with first. Not that I have no idea yet - I have been interested in data science and machine learning for a while and read about it on a regular basis. It's just that now I'm trying to get serious about it and make the learning process more structured and organized. 

-- Field Cady - The Data Science Handbook

This is the book I'm considering to be a source of general knowledge and understanding of the field. 

IV. Data Science using Python

This is the most problematic section because there are plenty of well-rated books, and I don't quite understand how much they overlap in coverage.

 - Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas
 - Python for Data Analysis - Wes McKinney
 - Data Science from Scratch - Joel Grus

V. Machine learning

Almost the same situation here, although there are fewer contestants:) 

 - Python Machine Learning by S. Raschka
 - Hands-on machine learning by Aurelien Geron 

General questions:

1. Is there anything I am missing?

2. How much do the books I mentioned above overlap? Is there any use in reading all of them?

3. Are there any other great books that are not included on the lists?

4. There are some popular courses on data science and machine learning. Unfortunately, I learn much better from textbooks than from video courses. Can the books replace those?

5. It might also be the case that the order that I suggested is not optimal. What do you think about it?

Thank you!"

CoxPH Regressions: PH-Assumption violation?,1,11,False,False,False,datascience,1511704853,True,"Hi,
This questions is provided to all survival analysis experts.

I'm running model diagnostics on a Cox-Regression model.
One important assumption is the proprotionaly assumption which can be tested using the schoenfeld residual (in R: the coxzph function).

As you can see in the picture below, according to the Schoenfeld test (see in the title) the assumption is violated (H0 is rejected) in the first picture, while it is not violated in the second picture below.

On the other hand, according to the grapical interpretation, the estimated coefficients have to be horizontal in order to hold for the PH assumption. As you can see in the horizontal line, the assumption is clearly not violated in both pictures and hence is a contradiction in the first case.

My question is now: which test has more power, the graphical or the statistical?

The Data Careers Space - Domains and Intersections,1,7,False,False,False,datascience,1511844219,True,"This sub sees a lot of questions about how to become a data scientist, but there are relatively few if any threads on the broader data jobs ecosystem, how these different careers are related to one another, and what possible progressions there are within each.

A lot of articles and blog posts I've read talk about the ""data analyst""  as a ""junior data scientist"" position. The work is typically characterized by descriptive statistics, database queries, and hand-written reports. Do analysts work alongside or under data scientists, or is the nature of their work typically different enough that there's not significant teamwork?

By extension, what is the data scientist's general role? At this point, is the expertise of a typical data scientist almost exclusively geared toward ML, or are there other use cases for their extensive statistics and mathematics backgrounds? To what extent are data scientists engaged in the data engineering space? Are they just consumers, or are they actively involved in developing and maintaining pipelines?

Finally, we have data engineers. How do they fit into the bigger picture? Are they just building and maintaining pipelines, in essence functioning as data-oriented systems administrators? Are they at all involved in productionalizing models designed by the data science team? How much knowledge of math, statistics, and ML does a data engineer need to be effective in the role?

Bikeshare System Project Question,1,1,False,False,False,datascience,1511901944,True,"I recently graduated with a PhD in Physics and am looking to transition into data science.  For a project, one thing I was thinking about was to try to determine the best place for a new station in a bike sharing system (like Citibike in NYC, Divvy in Chicago, etc.).  I'm wondering though if I'm biting off more than I can chew here if I'm just starting out.  


In any case, I am thinking of doing something like looking at the relationship, for each current station, between the most travelled to stations and the distance to those stations.  If there's an area of the city where the distances are higher when they don't have to be, then maybe that's a place to look.  Does this seem reasonable, or is there a more impressive ""data sciency"" way to do this?"

Guidance on potentially moving from 10 years of SAP Consultancy to Data Sciences,1,2,False,False,False,datascience,1511912750,True,"Hi all,

I'm kind of at a crossroads in my career and was thinking of moving into Data Sciences and am hoping for some clarification.

Background about me. I've been working in the SAP sphere for around 10 years now. Initially started out as an SAP Technical Consultant where I spent 4 years on an SAP implementation and during that time I got into Data Analytics and Archiving (especially in BI) which led me to move to a company that specialises in SAP Data Archiving where I've worked for a multitude of clients across industry. My issue is that I think I have hit my ceiling in this field and the repetitive cycle of projects really has hit my motivation.

I am quite worried that I've burrowed myself into a hole due to the unique (and to be fair, highly crap) nature of SAP and I'm concerned that my skills aren't transferable into any other line of work. 

A few of my former colleagues in the SAP BI sphere bit the bullet a few years ago and moved into the Data Sciences sphere as part of their company's direction and they seem to be really enjoying the work they're doing along with the rewards. When asked how they got started? They just said their company threw them into the deep end to figure it out themselves.

I've always had a mathematical and analytical mind (terrible at programming) and was hoping to delve into this sphere. My problem being that I don't have any hands on experience and no certifications to provide.

My questions are:

1. What should I be proficient in? What should I get my certifications in?

2. How critical is it to be well versed in programming languages? This has been my major weak point in both academic and professional life. 

3. Would I have to apply for entry level jobs once I get the first part done? Is there anything in my previous line of work that I can leverage for a different position? 

Thanks for reading. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Learning Data Science the right way,27,61,False,False,False,datascience,1512001666,True,"Data Science, the old school way

To me, software engineering is a passion and a feeling of self-fulfillment which, when coupled with fruitful projects giving way to advancements in society and humanity as a whole, flares a deeply rooted passion to learn learn learn! This is why, when I first read up on Data Science, I knew that I had honed in on my next target to devour and assimilate into my neural network (yes, the biological one!)

But as I started reading through the hundreds of how-to’s, blogs, MOOCS, video tutorials, online books, PDFs and the rest, I only found more frustration with missing pieces to a larger and more obscure logical puzzle that was defiant and unyielding. A feeling of unrest and concern surfaced my mind as I delved more deeply into the subject getting half-baked and limited understanding allowing me to build only by following “hand-holding” step by step instructions. This was not engineering! Trial after trial the matter finally became clear to me — The topic of Data Science strictly refuses to truly enter a mind until it is imbued with proper mathematical/statistical foundations!

As my reading on Data Science progressed, I would read or hear terms that I knew were key to understanding how Neural Networks worked, but it was just half baked! I started seeing this trend of people seizing the opportunity to piggy back off the Data Science craze and authoring reads and making full fledged online “Data Camps” that in the end will always avoid the real mechanics behind the subject. They breeze through the parts where mathematical foundations are necessary and move on as if it was a side matter and not required to build reliable models. Take this snippet from a free online book for Neural Networks as an example,

“On a related note, the mathematical requirements to read the book are modest. There is some mathematics in most chapters, but it’s usually just elementary algebra and plots of functions, which I expect most readers will be okay with. I occasionally use more advanced mathematics, but have structured the material so you can follow even if some mathematical details elude you.”

Reading through only the second half of Chapter 1: “ We’ll also define the gradient of C to be the vector of partial derivatives”, “We denote the gradient vector by ∇C” and“Then Equation (9) tells us that ΔC≈−η∇C⋅∇C=−η∥∇C∥2.”, all prove otherwise and goes against being “elementary.”

This is why I found myself constantly referring back to tutorials that explained the topic of gradient descent, limits, derivatives, vectors, statistics then go back to continue my reading. But this style of learning left me with a feeling of despair resonating from my logical side whispering, “It’s not enough, I still want to know WHY and HOW!”

Then, one day as I was cleaning up my closet, my eyes suddenly fell on my old college Single Variable Calculus book by James Stewart. Followed by a sudden dramatic stare and a sense of joy from a reunion with an old friend, an innate feeling told me that an epiphany is about to occur! I opened the book - chapter 1 - and lo and behold! “This…is it. It’s…it’s all there! IT’S ALL THERE!” Really, all the missing pieces and loose ends were so finely andreliably described that it left no room for confusion. Yes, I do agree that only after having gone through all the Data Science tutorials that Calculus made so much more sense - but it was still a critical piece to the big Data Science puzzle.

The point I’m driving here is that I feel that there are many fields in I.T. that are slowly being driven by marketing objectives and quick responses to technology hypes rather than the classic RT*M way of deeply rooted “old school” developers. Head hunters are scouring to find anyone that can “fit the description” screening people through checkoff lists and “how many years of” rather than searching for minds withchemical X which in turn forces future Data Scientist to prepare to become real engineers. The pressure coming down from this flawed style of talent selection is slowly giving rise to a batch of cooky cutter engineers that sparks worry given the way the entire field of I.T. ties in together. Security, reliability, scalability and general advancements in I.T. are all negatively effected by allowing the field to grow without well founded roots. Take how Android programming tutorials started as a classic example. The push and drive behind most of the videos, MOOCs, and tutorials was to quickly jump on the demand and make things seem as easy as possible to drive more readers and not towards making strong android engineers. This finally resulted in poor android engineers that designed poorly designed apps making way for many security and stability issues. I believe this is the same trend that is taking place in the Data Science field.

In summary, if you really want to understand Data Science in a way that will allow you to have a positive impact and pave the way for your future in this ever growing field then I strongly suggest studying the basics really well - along with all the MOOCs, videos and tutorials that are still key in understand Data Science and Machine Learning."

I just got an internship - should I bother with further studies?,2,2,False,False,False,datascience,1512014869,True,"I finished a joint honours BA in econometrics and politics in may 2017. No internships during my BA so I decided to do a masters in CompSci this September as it will make me more employable. Be it as it may, I have an internship offer for next semester at a big bank, and my supervisor said that contingent on job performance and funding, they are always looking to make the interns into a full time hire. 

Anyway, I have a question vis-a-vis qualification.

Looking at postings, I find that a lot of data science / big data / machine learning jobs require advanced degrees in fields such as CS or statistics. I am wondering - **if I stop at a BA, can my experience down the road overshadow against the lack of higher degree? I am scared that I will be stuck in junior roles without an advanced degree.**

If I drop my classes next semester to focus on the internship, I will have to wait a full year before taking MA classes again because they are not available every semester. This won't be a problem if I'm offered an extension. But I'm fucked if they don't give me an extension.

I'll be looking at traffic counts relative to time and position, vehicles entering and exit the highway, speed of vehicles travelling in time and space, etc. I wont be working on this alone, but I would like to learn more about the data side so I know what to actually research for that portion of my thesis.

My current knowledge base in math is calc 1-3, diff eq. and linear algebra. Statistically I have taken a general undergraduate stats class, a graduate modeling in transportation class that taught R and graduate statistics in transportation class that taught a few statistical models (OLS, Poisson, negative binomial, multi. logit, nested logit, probit, etc), I don't feel like I understand much statistics I learned though, like I know what models are and when to use some, but I google alot when I'm doing homework and still unclear in the end. My programming is fairly weak, I only know basic matlab, a program called nlogit and some basic R (can run some models). I can kind of clean data, but a little uneasy, would like to learn how to do this better.

Our current structure of update meetings is 2x per week. In one meeting, we invite our stakeholders (PMs, marketing, sales, not eng though) to attend and we go through a list of bullet points for each Data person saying what we’re working on and what we plan to work on next. This allows our stakeholders to be aware of what we’re doing and request analysis on different things they’re interested in. In the second meeting, we only have the data scientists invited and that’s where we present the actual details of our projects, show each other code / visualizations, and discuss in detail. Usually our stakeholders only see the visualizations and results of a project and we present it to them in meetings related to whatever the topic is, but in the regular update meeting they just see a typical tracker with bullet points. 

I was thinking of ways to make our update meeting more engaging to the stakeholders. Maybe one DS shows a “visualization of the week” where we choose 1 graph that shows a snippet of what we’re working on. Or maybe an “insight of the week” where we give an interesting fact we learned from data that week. I’m just looking for ways that we can make the update meeting more interesting for product managers, marketing, etc.

Quite a few people who've previously held my position have made the transition to Data Analytics. I truly believe that these sorts of jobs are the future of my field and that if I don't keep up, I'll end up unemployed. I went to an info session for a General Assembly course about Data Science, which was highly interesting, but I quickly learned that most of the people getting into these roles already have experience with coding. While I did take two IT courses in college and did pretty well in them, I flunked the one C++ class I took, mostly because the class went too fast for a beginner like me. I'm willing to take an intro to Python course before getting into DS, but a lot of the courses I'm looking into teach R even though they recommend you learn Python before (like WTF).

I don't necessarily need or want a certificate or a master's, since my company would likely support my career development.

Best Data and Analytics Conferences,5,2,False,False,False,datascience,1512076519,True,"Hey all - I've been asked to compile a list of the best data and analytics conferences out there so I was wondering:

I'm Turning to the Master of Data Science on Reddit,19,2,False,False,False,datascience,1512076548,True,"I'm looking for a job.

I've been out of work for awhile, and I heard from a college buddy about Data Science. There was something about the creamy blend of analytics, data, and problem solving that I fell in love with. It was, and still is, my mission to wrap my head around the process, the methods, the reporting and ultimately attain the job title of Data Scientist (even got a Halloween costume idea planned out).

My background:

I have a BS in MIS, minor in CompSci. Since college I've started a few businesses, gone to Japan for half a decade to teach, but for my tech career I've spent about 7 to 8 years tinkering with SQL databases, working with (developing) CRM systems, teaching these systems to employees, building reports, a pinch of ETL, a dash of SSIS.

I've taken classes on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/datascience/), I passed my [SAS Base Programmer cert test](https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/base-programmer.html) (and I've purchased many many more), and I'm working towards my [Data Science Certificate from Microsoft](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/data-science/), I'm hitting up my Tableau certification next, but I still feel frustrated, unfulfilled (and confused!).

For the job, I've applied for many things, I've had many calls (from recruiters) a couple phone interviews, and one face-to-face. I'm frustrated because I just want to get in and start working. I need a job!

So I turn to you, the gurus. The masters of your destiny. The torchbearers of analytical wisdom and seers of visualizations.

1. I need a mentor, a live study group, a tutor (any volunteers? I'll pay!) that can take me through steps and help me to connect the dots.

2. What am I missing? What can I do, where can I look, where can I start (job-wise) that can help me find my place in the path to true data science? Why are all the jobs for ""expert this"" and ""senior that"" when even an entry level position would do?"
DataScience and YouTube/Social Media Analytics,4,5,False,False,False,datascience,1512080454,True,"Hi everyone, 

I'm looking to transition from Mechanical Engineering to Data science, and have been scouring this subreddit for days. I'm currently doing Udemy's python data science course and I'm learning about Numpy, panda, and all the main python libraries rn.

I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this. I would love to talk to you and see if it's worth pursuing. These platforms already have a set of analytics tools and I'm able to export CSVs.

got the weirdest certificates sales pitch today,11,5,False,False,False,datascience,1512102487,True,"Tonight I went to an open house/info session for a university certificate program in big data and predictive analytics.  It's not a post-grad certificate; technically you can do it straight out of high school if you have the right math credits, but most students have at least some college before starting this program.

The presenter seemed... not to put too fine a point on it but ... f%$ing insane.  She went on and on about how there are fewer good secure jobs with benefits these days (which is true) and how graduates of this certificate with no experience walk into jobs paying well over $100K, and those who do the fast-track intensive certificate (full-time for one semester) walk into jobs paying like $150K.  Apparently they benefit from the ""immersive"" experience of it, or something.  She made it sound like this was the last best hope and a sure thing for a secure, well-paying job.

To me, these numbers seemed nuts.  I know some data science jobs pay those numbers but isn't that more for experienced people with master's and PhDs?

Another weird thing.  I asked a simple yes/no question: Could I just take some of the courses without doing the whole certificate?  She answered with a lecture about how employers want the full certificate and she's heard ""horror stories"" from students who regret just taking a few courses, how I wouldn't progress in my career without it.  She motioned to me while saying that women over 35 (which I am) have an even tougher time in the job market, she's just being honest.  WTF?

When I got home I looked her up and found out she is actually a French professor who somehow is now the director of a group of certificate programs at this university.  She has no analytics background and no apparent qualifications in labour markets either.

Later we got some time to talk to a couple of the instructors in the program who weren't terribly impressive.  They just kept repeating that how you do in the program depends on how much work you put into it.

Data Science approaches to detect subtle signals in oil movements data,0,3,False,False,False,datascience,1512114499,True,"Hypothesis:

Asian countries import oil from all over the world. For some fraction of that total, they have flexibility in deciding where to import it from. Of course price is a large component of that decision. Concrete example: in August, Hurricane Harvey shut down refinery operations in the US Gulf Coast, creating a large overhang of unneeded oil. India and China bought most of that oil at a big discount, and reduced their intake of oil from the Persian Gulf. The US oil was a better price, so they switched.

There is price-sensitive switching like this throughout the world.

I am trying to systematically identify the most significant and common switching flows.

The data I have:

I have a database, since 2015, of every individual ship voyage that moved crude oil from one location to another throughout the world. I can aggregate it to tuples of the form (month/year, originCountry, destinationCountry, totalVolume)

I would like to identify meaningful switching patterns in this data.

Confounding elements:

Markets are constantly changing, so switching patterns that made economic sense in 2015 might not make sense today, when other patterns emerge.

Oil markets are growing, so these switches are not zero-sum actions, where an increase in X results directly in a decrease in Y. If China’s refinery demand is growing, next month instead of increasing Persian Gulf imports by 100k bbls/day, maybe it only increases 40kbd, and instead takes an incremental 60kbd from North America.

There is seasonality to refinery behavior – they have cycles of refinery maintenance and seasonal demand and are also sensitive to general market conditions (overall price).

The source data is very granular, so there are lots of minor, noisy movements that aren’t meaningful.

Some countries are semi-groupable. Many of countries in the PG export similar types/prices of oil.

My first solution idea:

I know the main destinationCountries that I’m interested in. For each originCountry that sends oil to that destinationCountry, take the three-year monthly time series of imports and calculate some rolling average, and std-deviation of the imports over last N months. Then I can calculate the z-score for each monthly (date, origin, destination) tuple.

With those Z-Scores, I can try to look for sets of originCountries where “postitive Z-scores for (originA, destinationX) are correlated with negative Z-scores (for orginB, destinationX)”

What else can I try?

I’m suspicious that there are more skillful ways to look at this problem with modern data science approaches. These are fairly subtle signals buried in a lot of noisy stuff, so my primitive approach doesn’t feel sensitive enough. What other approaches would people suggest? One concern I have is, this is not “Big Data” by any sense – three years of essentially monthly data. So I fear that limits the techniques that I can deploy."

Given the power of change and influence that comes inherent with this technology, does it make sense that the direction of DS becomes molded by non-scientists? By people that have ""making lots of money"" and gaining power over society as their objective for example? Just because they hold the keys of employment?

My point is, should Data Scientists move with the flow of market demand or should they move towards making this field reach its fullest potential and have a real position in the field of science - like physics, chemistry, biology etc? A subject with well defined scientific objectives or another tool for companies to make money?

Hello everyone, I am a CS major with an internship where I am doing web development, basic stuff, Laravel/PHP, MySql, Javascript. 

I am interested in data science/analytics, and I had the idea to try to implement it at my internship (for one I can get paid while I learn about it and see if I like it, and also will look good on my resume :) )

So far, we don't really have anything like that here, we have a team that does some SEO, Google Analytics type stuff, but I have overheard them talking about ""data visualization, data science, data analytics"". 

I want to try to get in on that...but I have no idea where to start? Should I look into programs like Tableau? I am completely new to all of this (hence why I am grouping data science/analytics/visualization together, not sure on the major differences between them)

Does anyone have any advice on how I could get started that would provide value for my company? The company I work for has many locations, we provide sales/services for people, so we have sales data, franchising data, etc.

Thanks!

Review of Springboard from Recent Alumnus,13,14,False,False,False,datascience,1512346818,True,"**Introduction**

I have seen some reviews of Springboard's Data Science Track, but I have yet to see a review by someone who has completed the curriculum and is in a similar position to a lot of you guys hoping to enter the data science field. For a bit of background about myself, I am a recent-ish college graduate in an engineering discipline. I worked for about a year as a business analyst before deciding I wanted to shift gears into data science.

&amp;nbsp;

**Application**

For the application process, there were a few typical short answer questions (e.g. why you are in interested in data science). After passing that initial screen, there is a shortish technical portion conducted online consisting of coding and statistics. The statistics portion is reasonably simple (multiple-choice) and doable if you remember the basics from any previous statistics course you've taken. Otherwise, a quick review of an AP Stats book should suffice. The coding portion would be difficult without any programming experience but is doable if you've taken an introductory programming course. Luckily for me I had recently went through a programming and statistics course recently so had no problems.

&amp;nbsp;

**Curriculum**

During my time in the program, the curriculum was changed, so I will be reviewing the newest curriculum updated around August this year. The curriculum now heavily relies on DataCamp for a lot of the modules, so I'll give my thoughts on both DataCamp and the Springboard curriculum as a whole.

&amp;nbsp;

I think DataCamp is fantastic. As a member, there are many courses to get you started in data science, from as simple to importing data and getting started with pandas to building simple neural networks with Keras and Tensorflow. I found the in-browser coding paired with short lecture videos to be very effective to get practice with the key parts of data science problem solving. Their lessons are definitely more geared towards practical experience and will get you going with scikitlearn and Keras/Tensorflow. Developing deeper understanding of some of the machine learning methods used would require other sources. For a membership fee of $30/month to DataCamp alone, I think it's a slam dunk deal for someone who is not quite sure where to start. A beginner should be ready to try his or her own project after going through the DataCamp classes.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the Springboard curriculum. The remaining materials of the Springboard curriculum is all taken from publicly accessible sources with little to no effort placed in creating supplementary materials or vetting the material. For instance, many videos are Youtube recordings from PyCon conferences with not the best audio/video quality. I think it would have been much better for Springboard to make some videos covering perhaps similar material but improve audio and video quality and create a more cohesive curriculum instead of many disjoint unrelated videos. Another example was a statistics assignment with a blatantly incorrect solution posted in Springboard forums by a moderator. It took months before it was pointed out by a student and even then it took much back and forth before it was acknowledged as incorrect. After going through the recommended Khan Academy statistics review, it was clearly incorrect to me and yet it took a long time before it was resolved. Also, none of the assignments have answer keys provided to students, so there is a very limited way to check your work.

&amp;nbsp;

The machine learning unit's videos and assignments are almost entirely taken from a Harvard class. The assignments were useful to get practical examples to refer to, but a few select lectures from the class was definitely insufficient to develop a solid understanding of machine learning techniques. Perhaps I've just been spoiled since I dabbled in Andrew Ng's Coursera amazing course previously. I felt a lot of my understanding of machine learning is from that course and independent research for the Capstone projects (see below in Mentorship).

&amp;nbsp;

**Mentorship**
I think the primary value of the Springboard program is the mentoring provided. First and foremost is your personal mentor with whom you have a 30-minute call weekly. My mentor was friendly and knowledgeable. As a part of the program you must complete 2 Capstone projects, independent projects undertaken with the guidance of your mentor. My mentor provided really helpful feedback and advice for lot of the machine learning methods I tried and gave me a starting point to create neural networks for my projects. My only criticism is that my mentor did not follow along with my curriculum progress very well; when I had issues with curriculum assignments, he would be unfamiliar with the notebook and wasn't able to directly help. I can't speak to all the mentors in the program, but I was satisfied overall.

&amp;nbsp;

The career coaches are available for 30-minute calls for things like resume or Linkedin reviews. I thought they were all personable and reasonably helpful so no complaints. I didn't get any extraordinary advice from them but it's always good to have someone read over your materials as second opinion. As the program winds down, you do a few mock interviews with other mentors to graduate the program, and I had good experiences with these mentors as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**
I think the Springboard track is definitely more effective than self-study but the real question is whether or not it is worth the $1000/month price tag. You are getting about 2 hours of expert project guidance a month, a $30/month DataCamp membership, and compiled free resources. That's a judgment call for you to make, but I personally do not think there is enough value to warrant the price tag.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Not worth the price tag though mentorship is good

Feel free to ask any questions if you have them!

Strategy for minimising favoritism,2,0,False,False,False,datascience,1512358198,True,"Greetings,

This is the best sub I could find to ask my question.

We have an event coming up during which there will be a best dressed contest.

We will only be able to decide the nominees at the event as it will depend upon their attire at the event. And We will determine the winners at the event also.

The problem is favoritism, as all attendees are from our company and the attendees will be voting, we face the problem of them possibly simply voting for their friends / Department colleagues. 

Are there any strategies to 
1) Decide nominees that minimises favoritism 
2) Decide winners that minimises favoritism 

The only constraints are that there will be 6 winners (3 male, 3 female) and that only our company employees can be involved in the nomination / deciding the winners. It should also be practical. 

Thanks.

What I want to do is plot these locations on a map of the United States in a way that I can differentiate based on attributes. Then, I'd like to apply a radius market of about 15 miles for each. 

I'd be happy with that, but if there were a way to overlay/apply a filter with population density data for the region that would make things a lot better.

How to set up a model if you know the target will be higher than a feature?,9,5,False,False,False,datascience,1512555326,True,"So I am trying to predict the sales in a month, given only the first week (plus some extra features).

My question is, how should I set up the model to incorporate the fact that my target will always be higher than one of my features (i.e. monthly sales will be higher than the first week of the month's sales).  
  

My current practice is to take monthly_prediction = max(monthly_prediction, 1_week_sales). But I hope there would be a better way to go about it."

"ETL Frameworks and why not just use a GPL (Python, Node, Scala)?",23,42,False,False,False,datascience,1512574250,True,"I was diving into searching for ETL and I'll be honest, I feel like it's just a ton of technobabble. First, no one can explain what ETL is. I understand what it physically is, data migration, but I don't understand why it needs to be a ""skill"". It seems to be more of a ""task"". Second, I can't find a single framework that doesn't seem to be more than a way to injest SQL scripts and run them on the database, so why do I need said framework anyways when I can just code this myself? Third, why does every single article I see seem like a sales pitch on another dependency? I don't really think I need Hive, Pig, and 10 other Apache tools to migrate data.

What do you actually use for ETL, and what are your thoughts in terms of whether this is actually a skill one should learn? Granted, I'm more of a software engineer, so for us, we call this ""database migrations"" and we just use a programming language with a database access library. We actually can set up a local store with a few samples from the database, and then run this script on that to test the migration. It's never been an issue. I'm just not sold on these ETL tools since you still can't beat the CAP theorem. You either run your migration on live data to keep it consistent, or you shut down your entire database and apply your migration. I just keep hearing ""ETL"" and I'm wondering if it's actually something I should research more, or if it's something that isn't that big of a deal."

How can i become a data analyst without Masters degree?,13,2,False,False,False,datascience,1512594688,True," 
   Hi, recently I'm really interested in data analysis area and was fascinated by deep knowledge of Statistics. So I've decided to become a data analyst/scientist in the future, but most of people around me seem to have a Masters degree in Statistics for the sake of it. 

 I'm a just international student in my university (3 years of Bachelor degree - Double majoring in Statistics/Computer science ) to graduate one more year to go, and my university has a excellent department in Statistics. I've studied basic theory of Statistics/Data modelling and know how to run basic database by using R-studio, SAS, SQL, Python. 

 However, the problem is, my family doesn't seem like in situation to afford highly expensive tuition fee for postgraduate, especially when you're an international student. And I'm not planning to go back to my country and study in there (The entry in postgraduate is quite defensive and exclusively working if you don't have Bachelor degree in there). 

 So I'm trying to find a way how i can get in this field without Master degree. My plan is to involve any project related to research area and join Data science club in my university so to be able myself to expose that area.
 But I still have no clue what would be the key to become a desirable candidate in this field. Any advice please?"

The math textbooks [in the context of data science] that you really read and benefited from,31,42,False,False,False,datascience,1512631784,True,"With so many options of math textbooks available based just on similar Reddit topics, it might get fairly complicated to stick with 2-3 textbooks on:

 - Calculus
 - Linear algebra
 - Probability
 - Statistics (these two might be combined)
 - Optimization
 - Numerical methods

Let's follow the following format: everyone suggests only textbooks that he or she personally read and found helpful. Ideally, a brief explanation of why you find this book superior would be great. 

Some more parameters:

 - Suggested books don't have to target specifically at math used in data science (have the ""data science"" in their titles).

 - If possible, books are the preferred format. There's no doubt that there are plenty of outstanding courses, but I have always been better at learning from texts.

 - There is no limitation on whether the book should be open source or not. That said, high-quality and free resources are a perfect combination. 

 - For some reason, shiny magazine-like textbooks don't work for me (and probably for others). 
""The Cartoon Guide to Statistics"" is often recommended, for example, but I find it very hard to read and can't even treat is seriously as a learning resource.

 - I totally can't stand textbooks where the author addresses his readers as if those were toddlers (or idiots) by all means avoiding anything challenging. 

 - The reader has a thorough grasp of basic algebra, as well as everything covered in a typical precalculus course

NOTE:

You can ignore all the parameters outlined above if you think that your suggestion is really good.  

Why do I need this?

I am often told that I should consult with a specialist, but I get totally paralyzed when there are too many options from which to choose. The same applies to my data science learning plan. Having received detailed recommendations on the best data science learning resources, I have managed to create a well-structured learning plan for data science (at least, the essentials). 
Yet, every time I encounter a data science article or post I understand that my broad but shallow knowledge of mathematics is a limiting factor. I am ready to put a lot of effort to build the necessary foundation in math: primarily in linear algebra and statistics. 

Eventually, I believe that we could create a structured learning plan for math used in data science and machine learning based on the discussion here. The question comes up increasingly often on Reddit. 

My upfront appreciation to everyone who will provide informative suggestions and recommendations. "

What should I do?? (first job rant sorry),59,5,False,False,False,datascience,1512654724,True,"Hi all!

I have a dilemma. I graduated this summer from a double degree in mathematics and finance. I'm quite nerdy, love programming and maths etc.

I took a job in a fairly small city in northern europe (around 1 million ppl). The job is at a consulting firm working as a data scientist. The job ad wanted someone with heavy maths skills, wizard programmer, statistics ninja, etc, you get the point.

I got the job and got an ok salary, not great with any measures. In the beginning everything was good. I got my first consulting job and went out to a client for a 1 year project. The firm that I'm working with now is a quite conservative industry company.

The first month I was really enthusiastic, wanted to implement machine learning everywhere and do cool stuff. I think everyone just thought I was annoying. I stopped with this because of all negative responses. Now I'm working in 2 projects:

- In the first one I'm basically doing undergrad lab reports. Histograms, time series plots etc. I'm getting no credit for anything and I have no meetings, nothing. Just some ppl emailing me to change the y-axis on a histogram to percentages instead of no. obs. etc..

- In the second project I'm supposed to make empirical models for a machine. I'm supposed to deliver a quite advanced ML model by myself, no one discusses anything with me and I have to work in matlab. I cant even use python because its´'s a company policy. They cant even provide me with licenses for matlab atm so I nee to use my student license and export code in matrix form... Also there is no data structure for making models, so I need to click my way through GUIs for hours to get like 200 observations.

Everything just feels so shitty... Not getting credit for anything and doing boring stuff.

Sorry for the rant but i don't know what to do. Seriously.. I'm thinking of working until the contract is over and then ask my consulting firm to move me. Or maybe do a Phd instead. I'm really sick of working with ""American Pie Guy""-engineers that cares about nothing and have no interests.

Any suggestions? Anyone been in a similar situation?

I'm also thinking of moving abroad, somewhere with more cool jobs, and enthusiastic people."

TAMU Statistics vs. Berkeley Data Science,29,2,False,False,False,datascience,1512702974,True,"I'm wanting to attend an online grad school program for a number of reasons. I have degrees in finance, I.T., and math, with minors in computer science and economics. I feel I am a strong coder, with a breadth of languages. Data science is the direction I want to head: it plays very well to my skill set, and it's a career which I think I'll actually enjoy.

Last summer I applied to 5 programs (some local, some online). My top 2 choices were Berkeley (MS in Data Science) and TAMU (MS in Statistics). I got into TAMU, but not Berkeley - I am scheduled for a feedback phonecall with Berkeley to see what went wrong. I have a feeling it was my GRE scores, which weren't amazing - I have my reasons, but it is what it is. Suffice it to say, reapplication would likely mean a GRE retake. My GPA was stellar (I graduated with triple honors) and I think my essays were on point.

Here's the rub: I'm starting to think it may have been a good thing not getting into Berkeley. This has nothing to do with the quality of Berkeley's program (which I'm certain is excellent), but more about what data science programs cover and what the market is doing. Here are some bullet points from my perspective:

Data Science Pros

- The Berkeley brand power is immense; this is a driving factor for me.

- The program curriculum looks very complete, despite its youth.

- Program access for life.

- Cutting edge and very buzzy.

Data Science Cons

- Much more targeted degree; almost vocational.

- The portability of this degree is questionable.

- The hireability of this degree is questionable if we were to see a recession.

- Claims from employers that data scientists are coming out of programs ""half-baked,"" where they know how to push buttons but can't apply (or even state) the theorems they're using properly.

Statistics Pros

- TAMU brand is formidable.

- Program is well established.

- Very portable degree in a variety of jobs.

- The hireability of this degree is far less questionable during a downturn.

- Several success stories of individuals completing this degree and supplementing with inexpensive data science courseware to achieve a data science-related job.

Statistics Cons

- Program is far more theoretical, less codey.

- Perceived as ""boring"" by some employers; doesn't maintain the buzz factor.

So here's the question: do I retake the GRE (which is 3 months of study on top of job and school) to try for Berkeley again, or do I gun it for TAMU and take some DS online courses along the way? Assume cost isn't a factor...

How to get more tech into my data analyst role?,5,1,False,False,False,datascience,1512904137,True,"Because I've lacked data analysis experience I've gotten work as a data analyst at a small company as a stepping stone to becoming a data scientist.

Its a small company that takes medical data from doctor surgeries and turns basic analysis on asthma patients via Excel graphs. The data is stored in an SQL database which is then sold for medical research purposes.

My main ideas at present is to be their visualisations to something more advanced (they had been looking at tableau before the person in the data team decided to leave), improving the quality of the data in the database, and using NLP tools to clear up some of the free text data they collect but didn't anonymized properly.

"With several somewhat-related degrees and certs and some experience, I'm looking to pivot into data science. Help?",14,8,False,False,False,datascience,1512921308,True,"Hey everyone! So for a brief background, I've got a BS in bioengineering, MS in a bio science, MBA, Six Sigma Black Belt (ASQ), PMP, and an IT mgmt cert from a Univ... I say ""somewhat-related"" to data science in the sense that they are all technical areas heavy in statistics, business, and IT. I've been doing operational-related process improvement and data analytics for a large distribution/manufacturer now for the past 6 years.

I've always had a massive interest and passion for machine learning, visualization, and telling stories from data. I was one of the pioneers in the efforts at my firm to get our legacy system COBOL data into SQL, and taught myself SQL, VBA, Visual Studio, and SharePoint because I saw the need. Since then I'm now a company expert on all of these things, and I'm the go-to guy from senior execs if they want a complex dashboard or to understand any of the big data in the company. I'm looking to pivot from my current food distribution company into the tech industry as a data scientist.

I've reached out to old colleagues in the tech industry and they confirmed my own research, which is that ""data scientist"" may mean very different things to very different firms. That said, it looks like it would be wise to study Hadoop, tableau, AWS, and R from the ground up. As for Python they said I should strongly build my skills with scikit (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib) which is something I've had superficial exposure to. One colleague said I should definitely emphasize the ""self taught"" bit on my resume as well. They said bootcamps are an option (though they seem incredibly expensive), and I've discovered pluralsight which I signed up for as well which seems more affordable. I've heard very mixed things about udemy.

For people in the field and those familiar with hiring expectations, do you have any advice on where to start? Is it realistic to pivot into this role given my background? Are bootcamps necessary, and if so, are there any that aren't $1k+? Are other certifications wise, i.e. from Microsoft or some other certification body?

Thanks so much in advance for the insight. After lurking this sub, I see that many of you are where I want to be in my career in the next few years."

Variables | Description
---|---
Data queried | The date the company received the flight data
Departure date | The day the flight departs
Return Date | The day the flight returns
Class | like business, first, economy, or economy plus
Refundable | True/False
\# of available seats left  | -1 if the flight is full or overbooked
outboundstops | The number of stops for connecting flights I would assume?
LOS | I'm assuming this means ""length of stay"" and the data confirms this
total | the total cost of the flight
merchant | the ticketing authority that provided the ticket

...and so on


So I'm being asked to find some interesting facts for the consumer like: When is the best time to buy? When should I fly? Should I buy now or wait? What should I be paying? Or any other interesting questions to answer.

**So my questions are:**

Do you have any resources on how to go about predicting flight prices? I've read a couple articles so far but haven't really encountered any algorithms or practices to adhere to.

What other questions do you think would be interesting to answer in the report?

As an amateur what mistakes should I avoid on this project? Or what tips would you have?

I'm planning on using Orange, Pandas, and Scikit -would you suggest any other languages/packages?


That's all I have to ask for now. Thanks for taking the time to read this!

From what I read I like the sound of laptop + AWS. My questions to those that use this option is how your workflow looks. 

Do you develop and test on the laptop, then send to AWS to compute and then send back? How does all that transferring work practically? I have never used AWS. 

Should I spin up windows or linux? I have way more familiarity with windows. Are there significant advantages to linux for something like tensorflow?

Measuring performance of regression models,7,1,False,False,False,datascience,1513013266,True,"

Hi, all


As one of my first data science project, I was testing different regression models (random forest, gradient boosting, etc..) to predict apartment rental prices. What confuses me is that the output of any of these regression models fluctuates a lot that it is hard to compare the performance of these different models.

For example, I was using mean squared error and learning curve to measure the performance of RandomForestRegressor. With fixed parameters such as maximum features and number of estimator, sometimes the model overfits data, and sometimes it doesn't.

The samples I collected has 5 important features (location, bedrooms, etc..) and ~20 binary features as dummy variable. The total sample size is ~3000.

Is this common problem in building regression model? Or is it because the sample size is small? I would appreciate any insight into this.


Thanks!

There are some conditions though. You don't know if there will be even one integer in the given time window. And if there are more than one integers in the stream in a given time window then at least one should be selected for every time window. You can't discard an element once it has been selected for a time window. The window isn't sliding. It's fixed.

Text Mining: Training Dictionary with ML?,4,5,False,False,False,datascience,1513076852,True,"Hi,

I have a general question on text mining regarding a business case. Note sure if I understood the concept of text mining 100% but let me explain my issue:


Imagine you need to analyze and categorize insurrance contract agreements as pdf-files.

For example the contract contains a statement like: ""cancelation of the contract is possbile after death"" or ""cancelation of the contract is possible whenever you like"". In that case I would categorize both statements into the ""cancelation"" categories plus a furhter subcategory needs to be created for ""cancelation -&gt; death"" and ""cancelation -&gt; free"".

 

Imagine now, another sampled contract would contain a sentence like ""the termination of the contract is only possbile when the agent passed away"". (sorry couldn Thing about something better Smiley Tongue).  In that case it would fit to subcategory death but only content wise.

So far so good, I guess manually creating your dictionary would be possible.

 

My question is now: Is there any automatized/ ML-learning approach to categorize this classification dictionaries without manually defining and categorizing sentences?

Maybe it is possible to ""train"" a dictionary ML algorithm?

 

And in case, which Software can handle that?

Thanks,

Graduate degree in Data Analytics vs. Data Science,3,0,False,False,False,datascience,1513131847,True,"Hello, 

I'm currently debating between choosing a Data Analytics MPS from Penn State and a Masters in Engineering, Data Science Specialization from UC Riverside (jointly NASA JPL). 

My end goal is to become a Data Scientist, but I'm thinking the UC:R program will be more difficult for me personally, without much of an engineering background (BA in economics, have worked as an analyst for 2 years). I was wondering if the MPS in Data Analytics would be just as useful for my career goals, since it would likely be the program I feel more comfortable/experienced with at the moment (plus I'm working full-time as well -- don't have a lot of free time).

I guess what I'm wondering is: How big of a difference might these degrees make one way or another? If I'm applying to Data Scientist positions, would they value the Engineering/Data Science degree significantly over the Data Analytics degree? Does anyone have any advice or comments about either of these schools/programs?

So here it goes.  I recently graduated with my PhD in Vision Science (my project was mostly on eye development and neurophysiology), and started doing my postdoc. The people I work with are wonderful, and the environment absolutely great - but somewhere at the end of my grad training and beginning of postdoc, I realized I don't want to be in academia anymore. I don't want to scramble for grants, crank out publications, go through hundreds of mice, and get paid &lt;$50k/year for the next 5 years while I hope beyond hope that I can get the elusive faculty position and live a life of complete madness.

The favorite part of my job is, and always has been, data analysis.  I love working with data, thinking about it, visualizing it, running statistics, determining the implications, considering metrics and relationships and all of that. I love opening a spreadsheet full of numbers and figuring out what to do with it and what it all means.  I love presenting my data and explaining concepts to people who aren't necessarily experts in my field.  I think I'd love being a data scientist.

So, I'm thinking of making a career transition, and I wanted some advice.  I am very knowledgable about biology (developmental bio/neuro/genetics...etc) and the fundamentals of statistics and data analysis.  I feel like I am better at statistics than my lab peers, but I'm not quite at the level of a bio-statistician.  I'd say I pick it up fairly quickly though.  I have a basic working knowledge of MATLAB, though I wouldn't consider myself a programmer by any stretch of the imagination.  I'm familiar with SPSS, but don't know (yet) how to use R.  I am a bit of an Excel wizard, but from what I hear, Excel can't handle the volumes of data that I would be handling as a data scientist.  I don't know anything about SQL (yet).

My question is, given my background, would I be a candidate for an entry level data science position that has something to do with health/biotech?  Would I need a lot of training/experience with R/python/SQL before applying for jobs, or is there on-the-job training?  How does one go about finding a job like this (LinkedIn? Recruiters?)

Any other advice is very welcome.  I greatly appreciate your input!"

General question just starting out: I would like to predict CTR,3,1,False,False,False,datascience,1513190250,True,"I have no background in datascience or anything else, completely fresh. I work at an online publisher who posts ads to facebook's newsfeed. I would love to be able to predict how many people who see the ad will click on it, but specifically to understand the individual features well enough to say: ""hey, we should do more/less of (these) things"". It's a small/new company so no one is doing this currently. I'm in a lucky enough position to have access to all data in the company and would like to try and get into that sort of work.

I have taken the machine learning course from andrew ng as well as read the nltk book for python. I have functioning skills in python and sql. I have googled the specific CTR prediction topic but am not able to interpret the results in any really meaningful way.

A facebook ad consists of 3 unique sections of text and an image.

Here are my questions: do you think this is a worthwhile endeavor? If so, what would be your approach? Any suggestions would be welcome. My thought would be to try to use textual features, time of day, image subject/color/etc and whatever else I could think of as features in.. perhaps a multiple regression? I've read a multiple regression should contain all possible features otherwise it's not useful. But there could potentially be many textual features that I would be unable to identify. Is that a problem? Would multiple regression meaningfully tell us which features are important and which ones we should focus on? Of course, the whole problem is compounded by facebook regulating who sees the ad... but I'm not sure whether or how much of a problem that would be. We do not audience target our ads so we do not know who sees them - but we do get a lot of clicks... several million on a good campaign (across several dozen highly skewed ads)

I actually spent a while creating and using some data cleaning methods on our ad text to make it all uniform, so I have at least done that. Any ideas and thoughts you have would be welcome! I hope this isn't too basic or simple of a question - I know I'm approaching this domain from a non-typical position in terms of wanting to jump in without much background."

looking for guidance,0,2,False,False,False,datascience,1513224886,True,"Let me preface this long background post with the following: I am looking for advice/guidance from those who may have aligned interests and are more likely to have greater academic rigor than myself. I figured this would be a place I could find such people lol.

My background: biomedical engineer, worked in med devices R&amp;D doing various things. design, risk management, operations, eng data analysis (frequentist approach).  Got interested in AI so started taking MOOCs. Now work in finance/health industry as a ML dev.

My role is to research &amp; explore various methods to apply AI to various use cases. Currently I use a combination of traditional time series analysis as well as ML. As I continue research to refine our approach for these use cases, we will (hopefully) scale this out.

In my previous experience the end goal (what's the product?) and process (how to develop &amp; launch product?) are largely predetermined and rigid. Uncertainty is largely operational which exists when doing anything in industry.
In my new role, the end goal is documented but there exists significant design uncertainty. This combination of uncertainty has given me a taste of what true research is like and it's bloody awesome!

My long term goal is not to get a specific role, but rather acquire &amp; grow a set of skills that can be used to solve cool things that motivate me. I'm doing this currently at work but in the future feel as though I should focus on leveraging my biomed engineering knowledge.

I have found most of the jobs that seem to have this nature are labeled scientist or researcher positions and require PhD's  

* I only have a bachelors degree, I have taken graduate classes haphazardly in various biomedical disciplines but never for a degree.

* I can rectify this with taking an online masters degree in CS/applied math while continuing to work in Industry.  I would gain no research experience and it would just be a statement on my resume. Would this bridge the qualification gap at all?

* go back for a PhD. Would love the work involved, however I am too far removed from academic research that the opportunity cost does not seem to be in my favour.

"Can we collectively read (understand) this 2016 paper: Temporal Regularized Matrix Factorization for High-dimensional Time Series Prediction (Yu, 2016), for predicting retail sales of items of a time series, using a novel matrix factorization machine learning model?",2,11,False,False,False,datascience,1513268258,True,"URL to the paper: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rofuyu/papers/tr-mf-nips.pdf

Here is what I understand from this paper so far:

- The model’s purpose is to predict a future value for any of tens of thousands of possibly correlated time series of sales of retail products, when there is much missing data due to zero sales, and seasonality, and sporadic marketing promotions, and greatly different quantities sold depending on item by orders of magnitude.  

- It is similar in purpose but not design to Amazon's model known as DeepAR (2017).

- Missing values are imputed by matrix factorization.
To implement the matrix factorization part of this new model, in my opinion it may be possible to directly call to the model trained using Generalized Linear Regression Model (GLRM) in the machine learning software available at http://h2o.ai

- Matrix factorization: Missing values are naturally well-addressed (cf. movie recommender systems), unlike ARIMA

- Temporal dependency learning. This may be a novel advancement, because it was not achieved by earlier matrix factorization-based solutions for time series.

- High dimensional time series are addressed, unlike ARIMA which does not scale, apparently.

- Wal-mart was a named sponsor of this 2016 paper on “temporal regularized matrix factorization” by Yu.  Wal-mart is a rival in retail business to Amazon, whose scientist Flunkert developed the 2017 paper “DeepAR”.

- Faster decoding of trained models might be expected on this algorithm versus the DeepAR algorithm because of the linear structure and the absence of deep learning, while accuracy might be similar.  (To be determined)

- My opinion: It might be an important paper.

2017 Paper: Sales Forecast in E-commerce using Convolutional Neural Network,2,2,False,False,False,datascience,1513270717,True,"Sales Forecast in E-commerce using Convolutional Neural Network (2017)

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07946.pdf

Here is what I understand from it:

- Data

1.8M examples

1963 commodities (items), 5 regions, 14 months

25 indicators: sales, page views, selling price, units, …

Partitions for modeling (nomenclature in paper is different than shown)

Training: Jan 1 2015 to Dec 13 2015.

Dev: Dec 14 2015 to Dec 20 2015.

Test: 

Input: Oct 28 2015 to Dec 20 2015.

Predict: Dec 21 2015 to Dec 27 2015.

84-day dataframe (# days in one example) was empirically found

- Model

Forecast the sales, given the item, region, for 7 days.

4 matrix (channel?) input. Each matrix is a time series:  item, brand, category, geographical region

4 CNN filters (throughout?) causes 4 outputs. # filters is made to match to 4 input channels. f=7,4,3 at layer C1, C2, C3.

CNN of 3 simple layers. 3 x (CNN, pool) -&gt; 4 x FC (n=1024) with dropout -&gt; linear regression.

1D convolution of each input individually

“We intend to capture the patterns in the week level at the first order representation, the month and season level at the second and the third order representation respectively.”

First phase of training: Train on all regions together. Second phase “transfer learning”: Initialize to weights found in first phase, to train different model for different region, always using same network design (“n-siamese”?). 

Cost function:  mean square error, Weighted examples more heavily nearer the day of prediction

Optimization: Batch SGD, Adamax

Input normalization: z-score

- Comments

All TS are independently modeled. Cross-learning from different series is nonexistent. Pure autoregression(?)

There might be information in cross-learning of TS, where correlation exists for example.

Weibull life/reliability in Python made... somewhat easier,2,8,False,False,False,datascience,1513271105,True,"I have a work project in which I'm tasked to perform some reliability analysis.  After a good bit of reading, I am quickly learning that the topic is much more complex than I thought it would be.  I haven't looked at statistics in years and I'm just getting a handle on the right questions to ask.

I have been using Jupyter Notebooks for documentation of this sort of thing for a while.  I love the format and repeatability, and I am a big fan of the data science tools available in the Python ecosystem.

In a quest to find some low-cost tooling, I was able to find that `scipy.stats` has a lot of functionality involving distributions, but does not support censoring.  I also found a project called [`lifelines`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lifelines) which initially appeared to have what I needed, but then doesn't really in retrospect.  There are some other items out there that had bits and pieces of what I was looking for, but nothing that really hit the nail on the head.

After some searching, I found a [github repository](https://github.com/tgray/weibull) that actually contains a significant portion of the functionality that I am looking for:

 - analysis of current data
 - test design tools

Unfortunately, this appears to be a one-and-done project.  I forked it into [my own repository](https://github.com/slightlynybbled/weibull) and have done a significant refactor to ease the use of the functionality contained within the original package and have been fairly successful up to this point.

I could really use some eyeballs and some assistance.  It would be great to get some confidence limit functionality along with a log-likelihood estimation method for larger datasets.

If you already have `statsmodels`, `scipy`, `numpy`, and `pandas` installed, should be able to simply `pip install weibull`."

I'm wondering if a statistic minor would be useful professionally or educationally over other choices for that time and money, like building a portfolio, doing co-ops, and improving my skillset outside of class. I've heard people suggest that these skills can be as, or more valuable than things like minors--at least with employers. If that's true and a minor is only useful on a resume than I'd prefer to skip it--I'm not a half-hearted undergrad unwilling to work outside of what's assigned; I've never been more serious about anything in my life. One way or another, I'll have *plenty else* to show for my time when I finish my degree beyond mere academics.

* Given my background, what type of position should I be going for? I don't think I'd be able to land a true data science position. Should I aim for just any data analyst position to get my foot in the door? How about business intelligence?

* What skills are worth picking up before I graduate in May and start look for employment? I have pretty minimal experience with SQL so I'm thinking of putting some time into that but I'm not sure what else.

* Is it worth leaving GPA on there? I don't especially like the way it looks but I'm afraid if I leave it off it, the assumption would be that I had a subpar GPA. Especially since I don't have any real work experience.

* Would it be disingenuous to list my degree as Masters in Applied Statistics instead? I think it more accurately represents the program but I don't know if its frowned upon to make a change like that. 

* I'm comfortable with R and only beginning to learn python. I'm not sure what the best way to list this in my resume would be. Is it worth it to have a skills section where I just list those two? How about experience with postgres? I've only used very basic commands.

Questions: 1- will a one-year certificate in Data Analytics be enough for me to land an entry-level job in the field? Alternatively, one-year master's in Data Science? At this stage, I'm self-learning R, Python and SQL, really hoping just to get my foot in the door, but most of analytics job postings here in Canada seem to require a bachelor's in Computer Science/Statistics

2- should I also be considering a degree in Bussiness Analytics/Intelligence, will this increase the odds of employment?

3-if you happen to be familiar with the market here in Canada, which city(cities) do you think have the best job market?

Computer Science Master’s vs. Data Science Master’s,16,6,False,False,False,datascience,1513366554,True,"I have recently become interested in potentially pursuing a career in data science. I have a non-traditional background in that I don’t have an academic history in mathematics or computer science. I have a bachelor’s degree in biology, with a strong knowledge of evolutionary theory. The only related coursework I have taken is calculus I and elementary statistics.

Of course, before I apply to any master’s program, I will have to do a lot of self-teaching, as well as take pre-requisite courses at a community college.

However, my question is this: If the goal is to become a data scientist, would it be better to pursue a master’s degree in computer science or data science? The generalist in me is saying that computer science will give me more flexibility in my career, should I choose to one day pursue software engineering, say. (Although currently I don’t have much interest in software engineering as a career.) On the other hand, the data science master’s will provide me with the specific skill set needed to succeed as a data scientist.

[Discussion] TDD organization for custom ML algorithms,5,10,False,False,False,datascience,1513391157,True,"I'm looking to up my TDD game, and I was wondering if anyone could point me towards some good resources? I'm partial to pytest, so I'm hoping for some examples using that library. 

What I'm especially interested in:
- for practice, I'm trying to develop a few recommender algorithms (like from sklearn-surprise) and I'm struggling with organizing everything. Most functions can't be tested just by passing in a few magic numbers... I'm needing to pass in whole test data frames or numpy arrays. I'm loading things into fixtures right now, but there's got to be best practices that other people have already developed, I hate reinventing the wheel. Is there a good book or tutorial or... something... where I can read more about this? Have you implemented custom algorithms with proper unit testing for a collaborative environment? What do you do to deal with the fact that this stuff isn't so easily decoupled from the data as other software engineering problems? What's a clean, easily readable, modular solution for connecting different training/test features/targets with my unit testing functions?

Alternatively (or ideally?) maybe you know of some open source projects using pytest as a base that you can point me towards?
 Surprise uses a janky custom file format, and sklearn uses it's own generator to create datasets... which is fine, but I can't help but feel like someone's got to have come up with a cleaner solution. If not I'll just cobble something together, but I hate reinventing the wheel when someone else likely has a better solution for me to use as a model. If you've written/know of a git project with really well organized and implemented testing, I'd love to see it. 

For what it's worth, I'm aware of engarde, hypothesis, and feature forge, but only that they exist, not so much how they can help me. Feel free to give me a kick in the pants towards one of them if they're actually what I'm looking for. "
Pattern for storing / sharing Python data frames for data analysis (X-post /r/python),9,1,False,False,False,datascience,1513392771,True,"So coming from R, strictly in the context of doing data analysis / visualization projects, I'm struggling a bit finding a comfortable pattern for efficiently loading and sharing data between [python] modules.

For starters, I hate those long run-on files that are difficult to debug. I like small discrete functions.

So in R, I generally have a load_data_xxx function for each data object. These load the data into global variables if they don't already exist, otherwise, they do nothing. The upside of this approach is that plotting / transforming functions can call the required load() functions and ensure all necessary data is loaded. This facilitates small functions that can be individually developed / tested for just their specific functionality.

In addition, it enables me to organize functions into separate files and just source them appropriately for each file. If I want to debug a transformation function, I can just run the (for example) transform.R file and it will source/load everything necessary for the functions to run. (And not, for instance, include any plotting code.)

I know, global variables are bad, but in data analysis, one it usually only loading a small handful of raw data objects and transforming them as needed for analysis or visualization. The key is flexibility in exploring the data, often at the command line, to determine next steps.

Now for Python (which I'm working to learn, specifically using Spyder):

Global variables don't seem to really exist, they are essentially module level variables. Sometimes they are available between modules, other times they aren't, I'm struggling with figuring them out, even when the variable appears in Spyder. So it sure seems that my preferred pattern is not going to work in Python.

None of the strategies found online seem to be promising and I feel like I'm staring down a single file that includes all of my functions.

Any suggestions?

**Actual topic:** Since CRM softwares are basically glorified databases filled with the most treasured of proprietary data of businesses, it seems strange to me, who worked a year into the CRM business, that data science is hardly mentioned in the field, and most projects that I've seen are nothing but setup and customization of said software. I've seen that Salesforce is developing *Einstein*, but it's still the smallest part of their advertising and I know nobody who uses it, and I see almost no documentation or traces of its existence.

I know how to code, but would by no means consider myself an expert. I have been spending a lot of my time trying to sharpen my skills in python but would only call myself intermediate at best. Since I am not a cs major I feel behind in this aspect compared to other students pursuing data science. Any advice on specific areas I should learn would be really helpful.


 
I started a little project over thanksgiving to scrape eBay and get sales data of certain collectible cards, because I noticed there was a lot of arbitrage and I am knowledgeable on the topic. I bought and sold 1 item already and made a ~25% roi, it was cool to me and inspiring to keep building. The program will be designed to scrape eBay’s sold listings page and takes all the relevant data on the item and put it into a multi-dimensional array. From here I want to figure out how to constantly store and update the lists, to have a rolling list so I can have data reaching back further than the 3 months ebay gives you. Then I can find price margins to flip the cards and see how the price moves over time. Since there are literally hundreds of viable cards to trade, this program will really help me sort through all the data and gain valuable knowledge. It is still in its early stages, but it currently can scrape the data from the sold page and put the right data into an array. Now that finals are over I will spend more time progressing it.



This project is the only thing I can use to separate me from the competition. I have no internships in data science and I had a rough first year when I transferred here so my GPA is not the best, although it has risen significantly this last year. once I graduate I think the best thing I can do is to get an internship to get more experience and train up my skills before I think I am qualified enough for a real job. I am going to spend this winter break filling out applications and working on my project and hoping that someone will take me.



I have filled out some apps already and have a coding problem for Akuna’s internship position due this week. I don’t think I am a strong enough canidate to get the position, but I want to attempt the coding challenge for the experience and to learn what areas I need to study more to get up to par in terms of python each test/interview/application teaches me something to make myself a better candidate. 
Anyways, this was very long but helped me to lay everything out. If you happened to take the time to read all this and have any advice as to what I can do to make myself a better internship candidate or advice towards getting a job, I would greatly appreciate it. Also if there are any specific things you think are essential to know in terms of python that will help me in my future, I would love to hear them. 

I also am highly considering going to grad school to get a masters. it would be in computer science, financial engineering or some other related field. I would only explore this option after i take a year off and practice coding, create projects and hopefully intern. If i feel i still am not qualified to get a job i will go on to get my masters or phd in something relevant, but since my grades are not stellar i am not sure what kind of programs i can get into, but i am sure if i work hard on my own i can prove my worth. 


thanks a lot for your time "

I graduated in 2014 with my MBA. Our operations track was called Supply Chain &amp; Analytics. The software packages I worked on through my grad work were SPSS, JMP, Mathlab, and Crystall Ball. I believe there may have also been regression modeling software apart from what I listed but I do not remember. I worked for a renewable energy company doing nothing but spreadsheets in Excel.

At the end of 2016, I moved back to my home state due to health issues in my family, now resolved. In that time, I have applied to over 1000 jobs, mostly in BI intelligence (had a screening interview today), process improvement, and project mgmt. I have not landed a full time permanent role. Some of this has been due to salary differences in the Midwest and South but I think part of it is I may be an ill fit for the roles I am applying to.

I have been able to work a few temps jobs, one where I was leading a group of 10 people for 3 months in a record reconciliation/scanning project. I was also able to acquire my GAIQ (Google Analytics) cert and take an online SQL Beginner's course.

Long story short, with the skill set I have laid out above, should I apply to data science roles? I do not have any programming experience and, other than watching demos of Tableu and Power BI, do not have any recent experience in visualization software.

I'm aiming to enter a data engineering field of some sort (so not necessarily ""pure"" data science) in a large firm. I discovered my passion for data a bit late, so my undergrad degrees are all business oriented (except for a compsci minor).

This is why I am looking into grad school, in order to help curate my technical/theoretical skills, as well as get some sort of degree behind me.

If this is the case, would taking the GMAT make more sense than taking the GRE? Most grad schools accept both, and I've seen MBA programs with data focuses before, so I'm thinking those might be good options too.

Need Homework: What should I learn to become a data scientist?,7,0,False,False,False,datascience,1513797297,True,"Short background: I have a bachelors in economics.

During college, I did quite a bit of freelance programming (e.g. web development, group projects, hosted a small SQL base for personal use). Now I've graduated and I'm building my portfolio and knowledge base. Where should I go from here?

Data science is a big field obviously, so I'm looking for a bit of direction. I'm planning on moving to Seattle soon and I'm going to be applying for work in data science.

"Those who have transitioned from Analyst/Excel Warriors, to working in Data Science fields, can you please come share your experience?",11,27,False,False,False,datascience,1513801502,True,"Hello,
TL;DR: I'm interested in how you transitioned from an analyst role that mainly uses more GUI based technologies, such as Excel, to a role in the data science field.

More specifically:

1. Given your current role as {{Title}}, what specific skill do you think benefited you the most? Was it more programming side, such as knowledge of Python, Pandas, etc? Was it more computer science side, such as algorithms and data structure? Or was it Data science specific, such as machine learning, deep learning, etc?
 
2. What resources have you use to learn the skill and what would you recommend/not recommend?

3. For those who came from a role that mainly uses excel, or other similar tools, what role did you transition into? What skill specifically helped you transitioned from one role to the next? 


Finally, a bit of background. I work for a small consumer packaged goods company (20 people-ish). My day to day work mainly focus on excel. 
In the past 6 months, however, I've begun learning python. Currently, I'm using python to scrape our internal reports (written in PHP, and outputs various HTML tables), then uploading them to a Postgres database in AWS, and wrote a flask web app that connects the app to the database in order to generate new HTML tables. I've hosted the web app on a Digital ocean vpn.
Along the way, I've learn some python, flask, multiple flask packages, postgres, nginx, gunicorn, and quite a bit about pandas.
 
The issue I'm struggling with right now is what path should I explore further? Given that I eventually want to work in the data science world, I'm not sure if I should dive deeper into learning python (algorithms, data structure), or I should go ahead and start learning about machine learning and such? 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Data Scientists and Data Engineers: How Often Do You Need To Be Both?,3,13,False,False,False,datascience,1513974262,True,"I'm currently in analytics as an analyst at a marketing agency, and I/my team often get asked to set up automated/semi-automated ETL feeds while also do advanced analytics/supervised &amp; unsupervised learning/marketing mix modeling. Since our team is small (six people, including the head of analytics who isn't as technical as others but is good at big-picture stuff), we usually have to know how to do both (we don't have any data engineers). 

I'm finding that to be able to provide better insight into performance, do attribution, plan a/b tests, etc, we need to have better data infrastructure, and since this is an agency, everything we do essentially needs to be ""billable"". Unfortunately, building data infrastructure is not something that clients want to pay for (it's expensive as hell), so we typically build out kind of janky solutions, and not necessarily scale-able.

My team is primarily a BI reporting team. Over the last year I learned a lot about how to use SQL and Tableau effectively to provide analyses. However, these last few months have been a drag. This is because all of our work has been rehashing old reports with new front-ends using the exact same data. There's got to be a limit to the number of ways you can slice and present the same data!

As a team, we've been working on incorporating ETL into our wheelhouse (which I thought was a great opportunity for skill growth). But in the last 12 months we've had our new ETL infrastructure, we've only developed 3 real jobs! I feel as if nobody on our team has actually developed strong backend skills from this, myself included.

I'm torn between whether or not I should keep giving this team a chance, but frankly I feel as if I've hit my ceiling. Any advice would be appreciated.

Advice for Experienced Traditional Data warehouse / ETL Engineer looking to transition to modern Data Work,10,21,False,False,False,datascience,1514076293,True,"Hi Guys,

I have 6+ years of experience data working in traditional data warehouses as an ETL developer, Data Analyst and a Data Architect. I've worked on 3nF data warehouses and built and enhanced many Kimball style dimensional data marts. Past couple years I have been doing more solution design and data modeling than ETL development.

Here is the current technology I am experienced in: 
* Relational Databases : Can write complex sql as well as plsql scripts, store procedures, database triggers etc. Most of my work has been with oracle databases but I have also worked with other vendors throughout my career.

* Informatica: This has been the ETL tool I am the most familiar with. I no longer do any hands on ETL development but I work closely with developers as I give them the specifications on what to build. I also get in there and debug from time to time.

* Business Objects: I have never been a report developer and have worked mainly on the database side. However, BO has been the reporting tool that all the teams I have worked on have used so I am familiar with it.

* Erwin: This is the data modeling tool I use.

Now that you know where I am coming from maybe you can give me some advice on how best to pick up ""modern"" data engineering skills. I am aware of what is in demand in the market and have been proactive do self study, creating a list of technology to pickup. This is what I have picked up so far as well as plan to learn in the near future but because I don't use these on a daily basis I consider my level to be be that of a beginner:

* Python: I know the syntax and the fundamentals of the language. I've also spent time with some popular libraries like Pandas and Numpy. What should I really focus on specific to data engineering and maybe data science? Ay resources you can point me to?

* AWS: I've signed up for the free tier and have gone through the majore services (s3, dynamodb, ec2 etc.) What services should I really focus on here and can you point me to some good resources? I already use acloudguru.

* NoSQL: I've done a course and played around with DynamoDB so I understand key/value and documented oriented databases. Should I spend time learning MongoDB or do the concepts transfer over easily? Any other tips you can share? I also plan to play with a column oriented database.

* Spark: I have no experience with spark. This is next on my list. I plan to do some courses that leverage Databricks. Any tips or resources I can use?

* Redshift: I haven't yet played with it but intend to. Any tips? I assume most of learning this is conceptual coming from row oriented databases and I should be able to pick this up fairly fast. Any thoughts?

* Tableau: I've messed around with the community edition. This is really low on my list.

So what do you think of my approach to pick some of these skills up. I'm using whatever resources I find online (udemy, pluralsight etc) to learn this tech and practicing on my local machine or in the cloud when possible.

In my experience I think self learning can only go so far and there is no substitute for working on actual deliverables with a team. My aim is to get to a point where I won't be deadweight and then just apply for jobs that utilize these newer skill sets."
Help! I'm starting a data science role out of undergrad as a company's first data scientist,6,11,False,False,False,datascience,1514084133,True,"Hi r/datascience,

I just graduated with a B.A. in economics a few weeks ago with a minor in CS. I accepted a great offer to be a data scientist at a fairly large, established company that I interned with during college. I was super excited about this position because I know how rare it is for someone without an advanced degree to get an opportunity like this. I was doing data analyst work during my internships, but I expressed interest in moving into a more data science oriented role, and they saw the need for it in their business as well.

I have 3 concerns:

First, from what I saw as an intern, the company has fairly low ""data maturity"". There aren't really company wide standards for data entry/storage, so even putting together low level visualizations in Tableau could be a struggle that took weeks due to having to consult with dozens of different domain experts and cleaning data and getting access to the many databases that different groups in the company stored data in.

Does anyone have experience being the sole data scientist at a company? As the company's first data scientist, how do I 

(a) do my job effectively in an environment that's not very put together data-wise? It's important to me that I showcase the importance and usefulness of predictive analytics so that I can keep my job and hopefully encourage the company to hire more data scientists in the future, but this seems difficult knowing how much of a struggle it will be to even get our data to a point where i can start making models. Do I just have to resign myself to spending my first year or so evangelizing best data practices? 

If evangelizing is up to me, what can I do as a new entry-level employee to change practices at a large company, and how can i generate value in the meantime? 

and 

(b) avoid being grouped with the large teams of BI analysts already working there and end up doing a bunch of SQL/Excel work? I made it clear that I didn't want this to be my role, and my employers made it clear this isn't what they want from me, but I can see a scenario in which I struggle to do useful things to delineate me from the analysts and end up receiving the same work as them.

In the long term, I'm hoping to either move up at the company through the data science team expanding, or move on to a position at a company with a more mature data science team.


Second, educationally I feel unprepared with regards to machine learning. I only took one course in my last semester on ML, but didn't get much out of the course due to a professor who didn't seem to care much about it (and honestly a little bit due to my senioritus as well). I'm pretty confident in my general statistics and computer science knowledge, however, but could use some review on the ""applied"" statistics at work in machine learning.

What can i do between now and my start date (mid Feb) to catch myself up? My current plans are to go through the Introduction to Statistical Learning textbook (which is what we used in my ML course) and then do some courses on Coursera. I'm also planning on getting some exposure to Spark, which I haven't used before. 

What I don't like about this plan is that ISLR teaches in R, and while I'm comfortable in R i'd prefer to work in Python. Also, I may be wasting my time since i know the basics of ML, but need to review and deepen my understanding. 

Are there better educational resources for someone in my position? 

Third, is there any long-term future for me in data science without going back for an advanced degree? What does career progression look like for an undergrad? 

Thanks for your help.

Data science charity work,28,76,False,False,False,datascience,1514109083,True,"So I was having a chat with a colleague at our Christmas party about data science charity work, and we came to talking about DataKind and related organisations ('tis the season and all that). I said I've registered with DataKind, but as far as I can tell, their primary sources of activity are hackathons (and they don't have an active chapter in our city). He pointed out that there has to be a bunch of local charities which would hugely benefit from some data science expertise - be it tidying up their spreadsheets (e.g. sticking it in a database), automating some of their workflow, extracting some information from their datasets, or building dashboards. In most cases I would imagine they either don't know what data science can do for them or think they wouldn't be able to afford it.

Data Science Workshops to Secure Employment in Toronto - A Gambit,8,15,False,False,False,datascience,1514312549,True,"Greetings, 

I have had an interest in data science since learning about AlphaGO's big win, and recently have been given the opportunity to do a fast-track workshop through U of T which 'ports' STEM majors (I finished in Biophysics) into the financial industry. 

The thing is, I'm really on the fence about it. At first this workshop claimed that a $100 deposit was all that was needed. If they find you a job in DS, then they will garnish your first 35 days of pay to cover the cost of training. If you don't, or don't finish the workshop (as I later discovered) then you are on the hook for about 6k. Its a bit of a gambit. 

I've tried to look at the Toronto job market for this, and its as expected - lots of work for CS majors or people with masters degrees or lots of years of provable work experience, but not so much for entry-level work. I know that a lot of these sorts of positions aren't advertised, and wanted to defer to an objective source (People that might be working in Toronto or know they lay of the land better) how easy is it to go from a physics major to something like data science and finance? Are there ample opportunities? Most of all, is a brief,  4 month workshop in Python, Java, Stats and R as well as Finance sufficient to prepare a science student for this sort of work?

From pictures on the workshops site, I can guestimate that about %60 of the people who took the workshop found employment. That's pretty good, but with the potential to not be among the %60 (if say this market is already becoming saturated with talent, as we speak) and lose 6k, I'm weighing this carefully. 

Anyway, your thoughts would be really appreciated on this.

Insight Data Science 2018,8,12,False,False,False,datascience,1514313295,True,I have an offer from Insight Data Science for the 2018 program. It seems really great and I would be willing to do this. However I found the non-compete clauses mildly inconvenient. I assume that during the program and for some time after that you can commit to finding only through Insight because of the good work they do. But they also ask to stop any current interview processes once you sign the acceptance letter.  I obviously don't want to stop any current interviewing processes (because the program starts ~3 months from now). However during the Insight program I wouldn't be scheduling any further interviews or start processes. Do any Insight fellows have an opinion on this? I mean I wouldn't want to stop the interviewing process now because it would be bad rep for me and the people who interviewed me. Any advice or pointers would be appreciated.

So basically I am looking for some tangible ways to build up my skills. I especially would like some books only because where I work I think I think they will help me build credibility because I can point to some fancy book when I am explaining my processes.

The first is [STAT400](https://imgur.com/tM193si), titled *Applied Probability and Statistics I*, which I've heard is a pretty easy class and mostly plug-and-chug.

The second is [STAT410](https://imgur.com/t2rL5cD), titled *Introduction to Probability Theory*, which is known as a harder course because it's more theory-based and has more proofs.

So, my question is this: do the benefits of taking the harder course outweigh the added difficulty that it comes with and would it actually make a difference at all later down the road?

Not trying to seem lazy but I just really don't want to waste any time / money during college.

Any ideas or suggestions for analysis and visualization of a hydrothermal temperature data set ?,4,3,False,False,False,datascience,1514403783,True,"I'm a geophysics graduate student in the US. My main focus and expertise is in signal processing/waveform analysis and geostatistics with regard to micro-earthquakes. The data I'm working with now comes from the [Cabled Array](https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/) which is one component of the [Ocean Observatories Initiative](https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/) 

I've finished the earthquake analysis and am moving on to the hydrothermal temperature data set. Installed at the bottom of the volcanic complex is a 3D temperature array. The array is a triangular frame as seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/jcOtP0g.jpg) and it consists of 24 thermistors that have been recording temperatures above a vent in the seafloor for the last 3 years. 

The data logger on the array records a sample every 10 seconds from each of the 24 thermistors. This resulted in a ridiculously large dataset (several million points for each thermistor) that I have resampled to 1 sample/60 seconds and may end up resampling to 1 sample/5min. 

I've done some preliminary Fourier analysis and as expected there are diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal signatures. The majority of the power is in the semi-diurnal tide.  I have some simple visualizations using MATLAB's interpolation functions and slice viewers. 
What I would really like to do, if possible, is to have a 3D triangular ""blob"" or iso-surface that I can step through in time to visualize the temperature change at the array in 3D.  

I have several years experience with MATLAB and slightly less with Python and R, so solutions involving those tools are ideal. I'm at a large R1 university so other software solutions are likely at my disposal as well. 

All ideas / suggestions for visualizations or further processing are welcome. "

"Data scientists of reddit, how come data science is a field that's basically just math and math and math, and doesn't emphasize critical thinking skills?",15,0,False,False,False,datascience,1514442141,True,"When I look at data science videos and communal websites, all I see is math algorithms and computer code and matrices and more mathy shit. Why aren’t critical thinking or reasoning skills emphasized / valued in this field? The way I see it, data science can’t be without being amalgamated with the practice of inference from epistemic probability (thats a technical term for critical thinking)

In my philosophy book, it talks about using statistics as a justification for argument, and it brings up a problem where someone is both a republican and a resident in a certain neighborhood. The statistics for how likely republicans are likely to vote is this one number. But the statistics for how likely residents of that neighborhood are likely to vote, is another number. Which means you don't know how likely that person is to vote based on the information alone and you need to do some critical thinking to figure out what is going on. Surely, this is a sort of a problem that will arise when data scientists try to gather together numbers to make predictions.

Now imagine you are assigned to predict--- which political candidate will win an election. The data that can be collected include-- race, physical attractiveness, how much people love him, how much people hate him, how many times he has shown up on tumblr, what his age is, what country he comes from, how high pitched his voice his, how many times he has worn a tie, what his favorite food is, if he has a rubber ducky in his bathtub or not---- thousands upon thousands of factors.

I fail to see how solving problems with data science can be done without being adept at the practice of inference from epistemic probability (which again is a technical term for critical thinking). Can anyone explain this? Why when I go to a data science website or a data science video on youtube, I all of a sudden just start breathing math?"

Define and create the role as Data Analyst in a company,4,10,False,False,False,datascience,1514453440,True,"Hello folks,

I have a bit of an unusual question. And sorry for some rough edges in the text as English isn't my mothers tongue.

First of all, I'm not coming from a Data backgroud. I'm an IT (mostly Linux) admin at insurances most of my work life (about 10 years now). But I really want to change some things and got into the whole Data Science matter more and more (also thanks to this sub).   

So I checked if there is a role like this already in my company (a fairly big german insurance, but with old structures), but they only had a DWH project to initially start collecting data started 2 years ago without much drive.  
I spoke to the project lead and she told me that she want to go further in this field but there is no prework done on how the role for a data analyst in my company could look like. And I should try to define the role and also a path to get there skillwise to show them my motivation.  
  

Now I'm sitting here trying to define the whole thing. I try to kinda work this like a data analysis project (Analyse the problem, collect data, ""transform"" data and show results) to show her my motivation.  
But the biggest problem is, that I never worked as DA. I already found some pretty good courses on how to get there but that won't help me on defining the role inside the company.   
  
So maybe you can give me some insight on what your daily life looks and maybe even somebody already working in the insurance business could give me some tipps. And what skills are needed for this job (except R or Python, I mean like social skills etc.).   
How much of the business model of the company do you have to understand? Like in my case how insurances are calculated? Or only which key numbers are important?   

I know this request is a bit vague, but every help is appreciated.   
  
Thanks in advance.

I've recently developed an interest in data science. I'm currently working as a marketing manager at a small company, where I learned that I really love gathering, querying and visualising data. Unfortunately, this is only part of my job. Because I work at a small company I take on every part of marketing, like creating Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn posts that no one ever reads.

I strongly believe that data science - possibly applied to marketing - is a much more worthwhile career path to pursue. Therefore, I've been reading a lot about how data science can supplement my background in marketing management. Does anyone have advice for someone with my particular background to get into data science?

Furthermore, I'm a regular listener of the podcast Talk Python to Me, and learned about DataCamp last week. I've taken a few classes, but discovered that there are tons of other online courses out there. Does anyone have any experience with DataCamp or any other online courses?

Hope you can share your experiences and advice!"

I will be processing internal documents somehow, but I was not given any more details on what my responsibilities will entail. I have no clue in what sense NLP will be used - they told me to review NLP concepts but it is a very vast field.

Anyway, I know for sure that I will deal solely with textual data. I have no idea what to review. All I can think about is sentiment analysis, but there must be more to NLP surely? What should I be reviewing?"

CS Master's Degree with DS certificate or DS Master's?,8,0,False,False,False,datascience,1514591304,True,"I am beginning the process of applying to a Master's program. I want to work with big data, preferably database administration. I have a bachelors degree in Economics and am currently working as a data analyst in which I use SQL, SAP, Access, and Excel daily. I have written quires in both SQL and Access. I am very proficient in math and have already taken some computer science course like intro to programming and computer architecture. I have been having an internal debate about whether I should enter a Master's program in CS or Data Science. Either, way I would most likely look for a program that can be taken online so I can continue to work. Further, I would most likely look to get certified in the field in which I do not get the Master's degree in. Do you guys have any suggestions or advice about which way I should go? Has anyone on here been in a similar situation? How did you make you decision?"

Which web server do you use?,4,8,False,False,False,datascience,1514612281,True,"I know there is no right answer to this but I wanted to get some feedback from the professionals and hobbyists here.

I like to build very narrow and focused visualizations (and supporting pipelines) leveraging Selenium/Scrapy/Pandas to collect/clean, Postgres/Mongo to store and D3 to visualize.

I’ve used both Flask and Node as my web server before and while I like leveraging the Python standard library, Node is far more popular (and documented) in my research.

What are your tools of choice and particularly which web server do you use and why?

Edit: I understand Flask is a framework and Node is a runtime, I'm using server in the loose sense of the word here."
Short term contract work 'trial period' - is sending screenshots of my work petty?,3,6,False,False,False,datascience,1514612319,True,"Someone wants me to help scrape some websites, I think they have 100 odd websites they want to scrape, and is willing to pay me.

I've heard stories of people doing 'take home data challenges' where it just ended up being them doing actual work for the company as 'part of the interview process.'

The person I'm talking to wants me to scrape 5 websites, and give him the scraped data, then we can evaluate based on time. I think this is perfectly fine and reasonable, but I am also a little bit concerned of him deciding to say 'no I don't want to work with you' but just walk away with free work. 5 websites isn't that hard for me to scrape but it also represents 5% of the work they needed done.

So I was thinking... as a way to protect myself I would send him two of the scraped datasets, then maybe screenshots of the remaining 3?

Or is this kind of a turnoff? I want to have a good relationship with this person but I also don't want to get taken advantage of.

If this provides any context, it's for a very small startup."

I'm coming more from the BI world (Power BI and Tableau), and I'm just more wondering if data is more just munged then passed to the BI platforms, or if there is any real desire to deploy production straight from Python libraries.

Thanks all!"

Ask /r/datascience: What are the most widely used tech stacks for building a data science pipeline?,11,25,False,False,False,datascience,1514655989,True,"I'm currently in discussions with a startup cryptocurrency hedge fund and might have the opportunity to be involved with building a full-stack, production-level data science pipeline from end-to-end. To prepare well for this opportunity, I'm researching the best practices and most widely used technologies and tools that other organizations have used. 

I've found that researching more broadly what other startups have used has been helpful. In particular, I encourage everyone to check out [stackshare](https://stackshare.io/) and [techstacks](http://techstacks.io/stacks). 

But I'd like to hear from the community about more data science and machine learning-specific stacks. For example, is there something analogous to the LAMP stack that is commonly used for web development? If you had a blank slate at a startup and could choose whatever technologies you want, which ones would you choose? 

Interested in hearing about anything from server administration, database technologies, data stores, hosting options, to scripting languages, and visualization and reporting tools. "

How are you developing Spark applications in a collaborative manner?,11,1,False,False,False,datascience,1514660971,True,"We rely heavily on technologies such as Redshift, Postgres, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, and RStudio to clean data, derive insights, and serve them to our customers. As a growing company (with a growing dataset), I'd like to experiment with a more sophisticated data architecting &amp; data science setup that will serve us well through 2018.

We've experimented with Spark on AWS EMR and have found it to suit our needs. I can perform data operations in Python and work directly with S3 and PG while my data scientist can continue using R. Instead of using RabbitMQ and NodeJS workers to perform large tasks, I can write an easy-to-read Python script to execute on a Spark cluster and share it via a notebook.

Unfortunately, there are a few areas where I'm unclear and I need to gather more information before recommending a new strategy to the team:

* It's not cost effective to run a cluster of these machines on EMR 24/7. What is your workflow like? Do you have a smaller cluster that everyone logs into? Do you run your jobs locally on a smaller dataset and then submit the ""real job"" later?
* If you're using Zeppelin, how did you approach security and user management? 
* How are you storing notebooks? Is there a hosted solution available or does Git work well enough?"

Resume critique: PhD dropout trying to get into data science,13,2,False,False,False,datascience,1514683612,True,"Hey Everyone,

I'm officially beginning my job search and was hoping to get some feedback on my resume. As you might have guessed, I'm looking for a position as a data scientist. I studied economics at the PhD level at a pretty good program in Canada (top 3) but left my program before completing my thesis. I think this is the biggest hole in my portfolio but I was hoping that I can make up for it with all the research projects I worked on and the skills I picked up while in the PhD. I also have a masters degree also in economics from the same school. Anyway, I'll let you guys tell me what you think.
