They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.

They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables. infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING. the pages were just matrices filled with A's. JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH! 

They are always VERY smart, but don't realize that while the class may be smart, they have never seen this stuff before, and have no clue what is going on because he is just flying through what is essentially child's play to him.

They almost never tell you what any of this is useful for! like WTF m8. i thought matrices were the DUMBEST THING EVER INVENTED because i took a non applied linear algebra course. once i realized how useful they were in computer science i was torn. They had all these uses now: but i still hated them with a passion.

Can an analogy be made between mechanical vibrations and bound states of a potential?,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1483411648,True,"In Classical Mechanics, we can make a precise analogy between a particle moving in a potential V(x) and a particle moving on a hill of height V(x) while in a gravitational field.  It seems intuitive that there should be a similar analogy between the energy spectrum of quantum particle in a potential V(x) and the mechanical vibrations of some object whose shape is defined by V(x).

What I've found:

The infinite square well potential has spectrum w_n = n^2 * w_0.  Similarly, a rectangle fixed on its edges has the same vibrational spectrum.

The harmonic oscillator has spectrum w_n = (2n+1)w_0.  A parabola shaped sheet (the area above the curve V=x^2 ) fixed at its edges (including the V=infinity edge) will vibrate with the same spectrum.

The potential V(x)=|x| has spectrum w_n = ( 2^n )w_0.  An equilateral triangle has the same vibrational spectrum

It seems that if I take make a sheet of the same shape as the area above V(x) and fix it on all edges, then it will have the same vibrational spectrum as the nonrelativistic quantum particle in potential V(x).  However, I don't have any clue how to argue this mathematically."

"My Python/Matlab scripts are mile-long unstructured bundles of impulsive code, making them useless (let alone understandable) later. How to improve?",97,223,False,False,False,Physics,1483455008,True,"Hi /r/physics!

I'm currently currently doing my master's (undergrad?) in physics at a polytech university, and as the title says I could really use some advice on how to improve my code structuring skills.

My Matlab and Python skills are mostly self-taught and I use it all the time to make scripts for common stuff, data visualisation, as well as more complicated data analysis (usually some image analysis).

BUT, my scripts are a mess! I made some relatively advanced things in Matlab for my Bachelor's thesis, but it was very convoluted for my supervisor to make any sense of, and after a month of summer holidays I could barely make it work myself. 

I always end up spending loads of time just remembering how it works, or rewriting stuff I've already done. My scripts are basically useless for everyone else, which is a shame as I'd love to share it.

If you have any advice or resources for making more more modular/reusable/shareable, i.e. going from random collections of scripts to more structured programs, I would love to hear it!

(Any good resource for PyQt and GUIs in general is also much appreciated, sometimes it's nice to just share an executable for people without matlab and python)

Thanks!

**Edit**: So many nice answers! I just want to clarify a bit, as I might have been too vague, and a lot of the answers are along the lines of ""Comment your code!"" and ""Use functions!"". I already do! But commented spaghetti is still [spaghetti.](https://i.imgur.com/iFVwEK7.png) Regarding functions, I do use them often, but I often end with a mess of small functions with different syntax. 

What I'm asking for is more specific advice on when and how those functions should work, and structuring my programs when (before?) they get larger than a single script or two. E.g. for a project in electron holography, I needed to: load images, match each with a reference, perform a series of calculations (fft, filters, phase unwrapping etc), some with user input, then save different versions of resulting images, as well as save some numbers from the calculations. Not a huge project, but it still spiralled out of control, because I was just doing it as I went along like stacking a house of cards.

That said, it's still some very good comments in this thread. Thanks for the help everyone! Honorary mention to /u/bheklilr for a very nice description of how to do"

"Internally torn between employment and passion. Job availability of Physics, more specifically Computational physics. What should I do?",7,18,False,False,False,Physics,1483503304,True,"Thank you to all of those who read this and take the time to comment.

Quick Note: I use the word ""seem"" very often because I am only going off of what I'm told. I obviously do not have experience in many of these things and have acquired my opinion by listening to the accounts of other people. 

I have recently gained a deeper appreciation and affinity towards physics. Beforehand, in high school, we did not actually offer an AP Physics course, and the ""Honors"" Physics course that was offered at the school was a joke. It was boring and I felt very intellectually unsatisfied.

I have become increasingly interested with bits of exposure overtime. I like CS. The theory of quantum computing intrigues me. Moreover, I've been self studying some physics on my own, and find that my I'm becoming more and more enthralled with physics. I am currently a math major, but I had considered of changing my major to physics and CS, or just Physics and Math. Ultimately, I want to do research in Quantum Computing

**TL;DR Get a Ph.D in Physics and continue studying Comp Sci, and get into Quantum Computation research. This is the goal.**

However, I know that in academia, and especially physics and mathematics more than anything else. It is known to get VERY DIFFICULT, to find people willing to fund and hire you for research opportunities. YOU MUST BE THE BEST OF THE BEST, and while my Math is relatively strong and I am spending much of free time self-teaching, I feel that in these two fields more so than any others, your job security is completely contingent upon your ability and contributions. You must be making relatively huge progress and improvment in your respective field to even hope of finding employment.  And it is a huge commitment to get become knowledgeable in either of these fields ( I mean knowledgeable as in Ph.D level knowledge).
The people who are currently in research I am assuming and geniuses and are expected to be the next Witten, Hubble, and Rubin's of the world; it seems that they are making serious strides in their research everyday. It is not very likely that I will ever be that, and the pressure of having to constantly make progress like this worries me. What if during grad school, I am not making any serious progress in my research? Am I going to be destitute / unemployed?

I want to know, from primary sources, how difficult is it really to get into physics research and moreover, if I can't, how employable is a field such as computational physics. I just don't want to struggle through college and never reach my goal, or not do anything with physics. Of course, I could always ""sell-out"" and go into Quantitative Analysis for some firm, but I don't really want to. I don't want to have to drop my goal of being a Physics Ph.D and have to resort to doing what apparently many physicist do; Become Economist / Econ Ph.D's to ensure that they'll get employed somewhere. Nothing wrong with being an Economist, I just don't want to fail at something that I know I'm going to invest alot of time into. 

I need advice. 

**Main Questions** 

1. How hard is it to get into research?

2. Researchers do you constantly feel stressed to achieve and do your achievements play a large part in your job security

3. Current graduate students, do you feel that you are actually doing well enough that you can make a significant contribution to your specialization?

4. How hard is getting a physics related job besides Engineering?

Thanks for reading and your responses in advance.

How mathematical is Theoretical Physics?,10,8,False,False,False,Physics,1483516657,True,"I'm a math student and I'm graduating this semester. While thinking about what I wanted to do in my post graduation studies, I realized most areas of research in maths didn't really interest me. I slowly began regaining interest in Physics and after a while I've felt  like going into that.The thing is, I love studying these weird, abstract mathematical structures, exploring their properties through pure logic and finding truth. But the way Physics interprets these structures, giving them this rich philosophical meaning, that's just beautiful and amazing to me. It can be quite frustrating to see how little mathematicians care about interpreting and giving meaning to the math. So, I thought about going into theoretical physics, since that seemed to be what I wanted to study: abstract maths + wonderful interpretations. I'm specially interested in the theory that tries to tackle the big questions, like Cosmology and Particle Physics. I guess I wanted to know how far off these idealizations of theoretical physics really are, in general, and also: how rigorous is the math? Are the proofs reaally proofs? On my study of basic Physics, sometimes it's a little frustrating to see some arguments on books that claim to be mathematical proofs that are just...... well, not proofs. Do researchers know as much about the mathematical structures they are using on their models as a mathematician working in that field? 

Anyways, any other advice someone could have to me about all this would be helpful. Thank you :) "

The value of high school students reading scientific papers.,37,159,False,False,False,Physics,1483808715,True,"I teach high school physics and for the past few years have been trying to develop a course that gives kids a sense of the amazing scientific thinking that went on at the turn of the 20th century without getting too much into the math. Students take this course after completing AP Physics C: Mechanics but without taking E&M (I realize this is somewhat problematic).

At the advice of Arons in his ""Teaching Introductory Physics"" I have been trying a historical approach as opposed to a content approach. I have also decided to focus on atomic physics as opposed to relativity since I have a hard time justifying what Einstein was doing without students knowing any E&M. My question to all of you is: do you think it would be a worthwhile experience for students to read the original papers from the scientists of the time? Starting with Cathode rays and ending with the Bohr model of the atom they would study writing by Crookes, Hertz, Thomson, Einstein, Rutherford, Planck, Bohr etc.? I recognize that much of this content will be challenging for the students, but I can't think of a better way to get them to appreciate the conflict, debate, and painstaking experimentation that necessitated the paradigm shift that became modern physics.

I had some experience reading technical papers as an undergraduate and found that, with the right guidance, it can be helpful in understanding the mindset (if not the actual physics) of the scientist(s). I would love to hear what people think about this. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks to everyone for their feedback! To provide a little more context, none of the students taking this class plan on pursuing physics in college and very few of them will pursue science at all. This may be the last science class many of them take. So my goal is to give them a sense of how hard, messy, divisive and inspirational science can be. I also want them to better understand a little more about how we know what we know about the physical world. The AP curriculum is great, but it's very clean and basic Newtonian mechanics leaves little room for interpretation. So thanks again to everyone for their thoughts. I will do some more work on this and report back.

""The full width at half maximum (FWHM) we measure is about 2 km/s""

and this is in the local standard of rest (LSR), v_{LSR}. I have seen [basic doppler shift equations to convert from these velocities to frequency (shown below in link)](https://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/obstools/velo.html). Although if I consider the bandwidth to be 2 km/s and the frequency of 1720 MHz to correspond to ~-45 km/s, then the frequency bandwidth would be on the order of 100 MHz which doesn't seem to be quite right intuitively as masers are typically much narrower. Also, in the paper, they state they observe another OH line at ~30 km/s so I don't believe my above interpretation is correct."

Teaching Coriolis Effect to High Schoolers,0,9,False,False,False,Physics,1484067241,True,"Hi, everyone. I'm a high school Precalculus teacher and want to teach my students about the coriolis effect. I know I can explain it to them okay, but I'm also wanting to actually do some calculations as well. Specifically, I want to calculate how long range projectiles are affected. 

Now, obviously none of these kids know any calculus, so I searched around for more of a purely kinematics version of calculating this effect without being too cumbersome. I'm okay with it being more of a rough estimation rather than being perfectly accurate.

I came across [this site](http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Ballistics/Coriolis_Effect.htm) and have been looking through the formulas it offers. They're pretty straight forward, and I've been comparing it to more complex versions. I guess it seems to match up pretty well from what I can tell; however, I'm not very familiar with the calculations, as I was never formally taught about this effect and how to account for it. Can someone who is more knowledgeable tell me if this is actually correct and would be good enough to use to teach to kids who don't know Calculus? Thanks for your time and any info/help."

So I'm delving straight into physics 2, before having thought I'd never be taking the class again.
What I'm saying is, do you guys have any tips and tricks of getting back into the groove of physics after a ~2 year break?
Keep in mind any background in physics that I have is solely on the 2 semester AP course I took.
This semester I'll be learning about gravitation, thermo and electricity

I am currently teaching senior physics in high school and want to redo my quantum mechanics introduction.  I have about 5 days to give the students a quick introduction/overview to quantum mechanics and I feel like my topics are a little lack lustre.  I would rather spend more time on the ""ooos"" and ""ahhs"" of the subject because it is strictly and introduction.

I would like to talk about things like superposition and understanding that material more but I am also limited in time and can only really use algebra for any mathematical understanding.

These are the titles to my lessons and a brief overview, and I was hoping you might help me out by giving me different ideas or approaches to the subject matter:

 - Introducing Quantum Theory - This is where I introduce what are quanta and that wave-particle duality can apply to more than just light.

 - Photons - I discuss the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, and introduce Planck's constant.

 - Photons & Momentum - I talk about the Compton effect and the ways photons can interact with matter.

 - Matter Waves - I introduce the de Broglie wavelength and talk about uncertainty and different interpretations of reality (the many worlds theory, collapse interpretation, etc.)

 - The Standard Model"

I need help..,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1484219138,True,"before it becomes painfully obvious let me just cop to the fact that I have no background in electrical engineering or science which is why Im having trouble solving this simple issue. 

I don't know how many of you have heard about trance-cranial direct current stimulation (or tDCS) but its a very fascinating subject to me. there is a lot of research suggesting its efficacy for all sorts of different endeavors. there is also some research that suggests its bullshit. I first heard about it a little over a year a go on an NPR podcast called Radiolab on the episode ""9 volt nirvana""

(its one of my favourite episodes, give it a lisen if you have the time 
http://www.radiolab.org/story/9-volt-nirvana/)

A few months after i heard and reheard the episode several times I decided to build my own tDCS device, i had some great results that are all obviously anecdotal. 
 
its almost a year later and i have some free time, seeing that i no longer have the old device I decided to make a new one

okay, now thats out of the way, ive been sitting here all night wracking my tiny little brain trying  to figure out how to get more current (more precisely, the right amount of current) flowing through me via the tDCS device that i have built.  

The circuit, which originally went: 9v (+) -> toggle switch -> anode ->  cathode -> digital multimeter -> potentiometer -> 9v (-) 

was updated to 9v (+) -> toggle switch(+) NPN collector -> NPN emitter (base connected to 9v+ through a breadboard)  -> anode ->  cathode -> digital multimeter -> potentiometer -> 9v (-)  

the circuit by itself gives out a reading of up to .80 amps but slowly dwindles down to about .04

the problem is when i connect the anode and cathode to any resistor that i have (simulating skin and well, me in general) i get a reading of 0.00. the voltage remains as high as 7.00 but the device seems to not be able to stimulate any current on a simulated (or even real) human.

ideally i would like to produce a current of .02 Amps or .2mA

im sure this is a stupid mistake or oversight on my part but someone please help me..."

I'm doing graduation in game development and as part of the semester we are supposed to make educational game/software. I'm very interested in physics and want to make a educational software that can demonstrate/teach middle school level physics. Its a team of 5 people at this point with programmers and artists.

Our current ideas are to show ionic and covalent bonds formation and gamifying it by giving player molecule and ask them to form that molecule. Input/output choice is Virtual Reality(HTC Vive) so players can feel like they are standing in middle of molecule and building it with hands.

Another idea is to some how teach double slit experiment with slight explanation into quantum physics. But we haven't had any ideas about how we can gamify this concept. Our professor showed more interest in quantum physics. Also input/output is VR.

I'm looking for constructive feedbacks and new ideas for my project. We are supposed to talk to experts in the subject matters because the point of this semester is to make educational project. We have to get the concepts correct even if it means the game/software is boring. Fun element is optional but appreciated if its there.

I am planing to freeze my laptop battery (li-ion) for getting it back to life and i will first 

1. bag it in plastic, (eidt) then bag it in aluminium foil, then again bag it in plastic 5 times or more  and duck taping it fully. 

2. let it stay in the freezer for no more than 12 hours.

3. de-freezing it in room temperature to it reach room temperature.

4. then unpack the (li-ion) battery from the isolation.

I have seen some claims there will be condensation while doing this and will damage the connectors to the battery.

and i was wondering if this is possible while havning it still in the isolation while de-freezing it in room temperature and making damn sure there is no moisture while packing the battery in the isolation?

	1. Associated with any particle moving in a conservative field of force is a wave function which determines everything that can be known about the system.
	2. With every physical observable q there is associated an operator Q, which when operating upon the wavefunction associated with a definite value of that observable will yield that value times the wavefunction.
	3. Any operator Q associated with a physically measurable property q will be Hermitian.
	4. The set of eigenfunctions of operator Q will form a complete set of linearly independent functions.
	5. For a system described by a given wavefunction, the expectation value of any property q can be found by performing the expectation value integral with respect to that wavefunction.
	6. The time evolution of the wavefunction is given by the time dependent Schrodinger equation.

Trying to understand the basics of undulators at FELs,5,21,False,False,False,Physics,1484427122,True,"Hi out there.


I'm a post graduate biologist and trying to understand the basics of how undulator  really works in Free Electron Lasers.

I'm getting a little bit confused when trying to understand how exactly the bunches of the same ""type"" of electrons are created.


So let me explain what i got so far and correct me if I'm wrong.


At the beginning a bunch of incoherent accelerated electrons are inserted to the undulator. Due to the alternative magnetic field , electrons are wiggling (Lorentz force). So I'm thinking of it as this force (Lorentz) changing their velocity (acceleration or deceleration I cannot figure out) and makes them emit photons with specific λ. 


Here are some quotes from the book I'm reading:

>If an electron stays on the phase of the resonant light wave as 
>the electron feels the deceleration field, the electron continues to
>feel the deceleration field every half period of the undulating
>motion and the electron loses energy


>An electron at the opposite phase, where the
>electron feels the accelerating field from the light wave, gains
>energy from the light wave and increases its longitudinal velocity. The changing longitudinal velocity in many >electrons
>results in a microscopic density modulation of the electron
>bunches.

This is where the things are getting blur for me. At the beginning of the undulator , the bunch of electrons are not in the same let's say line (incoherent) , and that makes the light emitted incoherent too.


What I would expected is that if an electron has the same phase with a photon, then this electron can absorb the photon and gain some energy ( which probably will loose it again in the next wiggling ?). From the other hand if the electron hasn't the same phase with the photon probably they may cancel out their phases and the electron will loose some of its velocity. However the above quotes seems to support the opposite. 


Where I lost it ? How these well modulated electrons which give well modulated photons are created ?


Do you have any site/resource/emulation in mind that explains that with more simple language and notation? 


Thank you.

But what i have been asking myself recently and what i perhaps dont fully understand is, how and/or why does time slow down for the person who is travelling 95% the speed of light?

The Legendre transform takes in a function and converts it to a new function. In pure math it turns f=e^x into g=u[ln(u)-1].

Learning vs. Discovering,5,12,False,False,False,Physics,1484599300,True,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this - I apologize if not, but for some reason I wanted to share this. 

So I just finished a worksheet where, amongst other things, I had to calculate the average speed and then the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas. Now I could've just plugged the speeds I had calculated into E=1/2 mv^2 and be done with it, but for some reason I decided to plug the one formula into the other and et voila: The masses cancel out and I realized that the energy was completely independent from them. Not a huge discovery in the grand scheme of things (or even a new one), but it was huge for me, because I derived it myself. 

Similar thing happened a few months ago when we learned the above formula of E=1/2 mv^2 but not where it came from. Skip forward a few weeks and we had to calculate something using the relativistic formula, but were allowed to approximate. Merely because I was too lazy to type all the terms into Wolfram Alpha I started simplifying the equation and after 20 or so steps, there it was written in front of me: E=1/2 mv^2.

I... don't really know what the point of this post is, other than how awesome it is to discover something yourself versus learning it out of a book. And that these moments remind me of why it was such a great decision to study physics even tho I hated it in highschool. Anyway, do you have similar stories? Would love to hear them!"

Similarities between historical scientific debate and string theory,5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1484874081,True,"I recently posted about whether or not high school students should read original papers from physicists who pioneered the modern physics revolution. I received great feedback and have reworked the course I'm developing as a result. I have a new question.

Do the experts among you think there is a connection worth making between historical scientific debates and the current debate surrounding string theory. I'm talking specifically about the following issues:

-19th century atomic theory: atoms aren’t real or are they?
-Cathode Rays: wave or particle
-Photoelectric effect: wave vs. particle
-Einstein vs. Bohr regarding early quantum theory

I understand that these debates were about explaining observed phenomenon and string theory is a theory of unification that is based on a mathematical model, but in my reading on the opposition to atomic theory in the 19th century I found myself thinking of string theory. 

The theme of the course is shaping up to be about the opposing viewpoints around the development of modern physics, and I think it would be interesting for the students to see that this type of debate is still alive and well in the current physics community. 

I don’t know enough about string theory to say whether this is a meaningful connection or not. Your thoughts are most appreciated!

[Terahertz] What are interesting optical phenomena involving Kerr non-linearity?,0,11,False,False,False,Physics,1484919273,True,"I am looking for extension ideas for my Masters project.

The placeholder title I have been given is 'Terahertz Waveplate Devices'. I have written an FDTD program and have modeled form birefringence and extraordinary transmission through pillar arrays with good agreement to experimental results (papers by Koch and Gallant) and purely theoretical models (Rytov, Chamberlain etc.). Not used here but the FDTD program I have written is capable of simulating instantaneous Pockels and Kerr non-linearity (i.e. ε ➝ **ε**(**E**)). What interesting phenomena could I attempt to model?

An idea I have had (although I don't really feel qualified to have 'ideas'), inspired by *Yanik & Fan* (2003), is to couple surface plasmon polaritons into crossed metallic ribbons, with a central non-linear crystal. The goal would be to create a photonic (or more accurately plasmonic) NAND gate for signals in antiphase.

[Help] Crossover regimes in measuring critical exponents of phase transitions (Solid State),0,3,False,False,False,Physics,1484972342,True,"Hi! I was hoping someone could help me grasp the idea of crossover regimes when measuring critical exponents of a phase transition near critical temperature. 

My lecture notes say this -
""If one fails to approach T_c close enough, one may end up in the regime where Landau theory is still applicable but one will misleadingly measure Mean Field values of critical indices. To measure actual exponents one has to approach T_c closer.""

This is followed by an example of layered Ising magnets in which near the critical temperature one observes 3D Ising behavior because the correlation length becomes comparable to inter-layer distance. 

**Question** I get what the example means but I don't understand how one can ""misleadingly measure Mean Field values"" and how ""approaching T_c closer"" will help. What's going on here?

___

(1989) 

Researchers at NIST stored approximately 5000 Be+ ions in a cylindrical Penning trap and laser cooled to below 250 mK. A resonant RF pulse was applied which, if applied alone, would cause the entire ground state population to migrate into an excited state. After the pulse was applied, the ions were monitored for photons emitted due to relaxation. The ion trap was then regularly ""measured"" by applying a sequence of ultraviolet pulses, during the RF pulse. As expected, the ultraviolet pulses suppressed the evolution of the system into the excited state.

____

(2001)

Experimentalists at University of Texas at Austin. They trapped ultracold sodium atoms in an accelerating optical lattice and the loss due to tunneling was measured. The evolution was interrupted by reducing the acceleration, thereby stopping quantum tunneling. The group observed suppression or enhancement of the decay rate, depending on the regime of measurement.

Momentum and the center of mass of the Universe,40,20,False,False,False,Physics,1485037856,True,"So I am currently studying linear and angular momentum, and I watched Walter Lewin's lesson in which he explained that only an external force (or torque) can change the systems momentum. The individual momenta of the stars (that was his example) that form a system cancel each other out because of Newton's Third Law. Because of this, the center of mass of a system is fixed unless a force acts on it. 

**So my question is this:** if we consider the Universe as a system, there is no external force, right? So the total momentum of the Universe must be conserved, and because of this there is a fixed center of mass. If we consider the Big Bang as the reverse of a perfectly inelastic collision, there is a center mass that hasn't changed and consequently a center of the Universe.

An Idealistic Quantum Computer Simulation Library In Javascript,6,6,False,False,False,Physics,1485208728,True,"Hello!

I wrote this library as I had a few things I wanted to show in an interactive blog post (not written yet), and I decided that I may as well write it properly and release it on npm.

The simulator is done quite simply,
1) Create a state vector
2) Expand the gates
3) Multiply against the gate matricies
4) Use a weighted number picker to measure from the probabilities.

The whole source code is there and annotated if anyones interested.
This is very similar to Quintupple (See https://github.com/corbett/QuantumComputing), but it has a different strategy for the gate expansion, among others.

It works up to about 15 qubits, then it slows down alot (to be expected)

If anyone has any questions or feedback I would be happy to answer!

On finishing a PhD program vs. leaving early with masters.,20,5,False,False,False,Physics,1485214084,True,"Hi all, 

I am currently in my 2nd semester of graduate school and have been pretty successful so far. The first semester I did pretty well getting an A and 2 A-'s. Coming into grad school I was incredibly excited about finishing a PhD and pursuing a research career as a professor. I have lost that enthusiasm and my mental health has been suffering as well. I still love physics but my passion to continue in the field and receive a PhD is less and less each day. It would not make sense to me to join a group and work with that group for ~5 years for something I am no longer excited about. I am wondering though how common it is that a program awards a Masters and after how long? All I know is that it is at least after the quals, your 2nd year of study and that it is heavily looked down on.  But I need to keep my mental health in mind first and the more I think about it the more I want to leave the program. I don't want to leave without accomplishing something though, so any advice, suggestions or people's own experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR: No longer passionate about completing PhD. How common is it to be awarded a Masters after some time of study and any advice?"

Currently, I'm a freshman in high school. I've always been interested in math and physics since a pretty young age. My dad's a biologist and he instilled in me a love of science.

I have a 4.0 GPA and I'm currently taking a few AP classes. I've took the ACT a couple of times (last time was about 3/4 of a year ago) and my composite score was a 34. Math classes wise, I've taken Algebra One, Algebra 2, and Geometry in school.

I used to do a lot of self study in math to get ahead using things like the Art of Problem Solving books. That kind of stopped a little while ago due to to more work in school.
I've read the articles about getting into top colleges, and all of them talk about having an interest that is pursued outside of school and which you have some notable achievements in.

I'm really passionate about math and physics anyway, so I thought, ""Why not? It's something I wanted to do anyways.""

The thing is, I'm having trouble finding ways to do it. I know there are math competitions like AMC (which I'll probably be doing next year), but I really want to do something more outside of common things like tests.

Do you guys have any suggestions on what I could do? Any help is really appreciated.

Question about using second-order reduced density matrices to describe fermionic condensation.,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1485438533,True,"I am currently going through some course notes related to this, and I am confused by the expression for the energy. Please, consider expression (2.8) on page 21 of [this pdf document](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01230626v2/document). 

If we assume fermionic condensation, then according to the Yang criterion  then the second order matrix can be written as a product of two two-body wavefunctions. If you now work out the energy (2.8) to be writter in function of this wavefunction, you will find that the kinetic energy term (laplacian term) acquires a factor of 1/N in front, while the interaction potential term does not. This can be seen from expression (2.6).

I am quite confused by this. What is the physical interpretation of this fact that the interaction and kinetic terms are integrals of the same order of the condensation function, but the kinetic energy has an extra (1/N) pre-factor? I suspect I am missing something to arrive at this strange result."

Is a percentage of measured pressure equal to a percentage of gas? [Biology Grad student seeking assistance with experimental set up dealing with Gas Laws],2,5,False,False,False,Physics,1485463712,True,"**TL;DR:**

I am mixing some heavy oxygen and nitrogen. My plan is to use the vacuum pump to get the negative pressure in the mixing bag to A [on this diagram](http://i.imgur.com/JfKKKnQ.jpg), clamp it at that pressure, then add heavy oxygen until the pressure is at B (which is 80% of A), then add nitrogen until the pressure returns to C (atmospheric pressure). **Are the percentages of measured pressure (in inches of Hg) equivalent to the actual percentage of each gas in the bag? E.g., does 20% of max negative pressure relieved equivalent to 20% heavy oxygen?**




**Full Post:**

Hello! 

I'm a molecular biologist getting my PhD and one of my projects is trying to 'label' substrates of an oxygenizing enzyme by exposing the animals to heavy oxygen. 

I've [designed a vacuum-exposure system](http://i.imgur.com/JfKKKnQ.jpg) in order to remove as much air (and thus normal oxygen) from the animals so that they are exposed to heavy oxygen.

In short, the animals go in the ""Sample Exposure Bag"" and the gas gets mixed in the ""mixing bag"". I am mixing the gas for reproducibility and because if I expose them to straight up oxygen, they will physiologically react to hyperoxia, reducing the function of my enzyme of interest. Thus, I am mixing the heavy oxygen with nitrogen to achieve a mixture that roughly reflects the same percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere (20% oxygen, 80% everything else).

My plan to do this was to use the vacuum pressure gauge on the mixing bag to approximate the percentages. I would vacuum out as much air as I could, getting to A on the gauge (then clamp the pressure in and shut off the pump), and then slowly add heavy oxygen into the bag until the pressure gauge measured 80% of A (which I have labeled B). Then, add nitrogen until the pressure returned to atmospheric pressure at C. Then I'd squeeze the mixture into the Sample bag. [(diagram again)](http://i.imgur.com/JfKKKnQ.jpg)

The problem is that I'm not certain if this is actually an accurate way to get a mixture of 20%, as I lack the expertise to know if 'measurements of pressure' can be equivalent to 'amount of gas'. In my attempts to figure this out on my own, I've quickly learned that I lack the expertise as well. 

So I appeal to you all, who are far more qualified than me for this:

* Will this plan give me a bag of gas that's approximately 20% heavy oxygen and 80% nitrogen?
* Is there some other way I'll need to calculate this?
* Do I need to take into account the actually molecules/chemistry of the gases? (e.g., would this be different if i were mixing oxygen and helium?)

Thanks in advance!

Can other disciplines of science learn from ROOT?,11,4,False,False,False,Physics,1485465854,True,"Hello Physicists - bioinformatics PhD student here.
A friend of mine (physicist) introduced me to ROOT a few years back, and it somewhat boggled my mind. Why would physicists have their own programming language? Why not benefit from the plethora of programming languages out there that already exist?

Then, after spending a few years in Bioinformatics, I think I now see why. If everyone learns ROOT/C++, everyone is on the same page. More importantly, ROOT acts like a domain-specific-language for physicist logic by being optimised for the sort of work you do. It plots graphs. It interacts with the cluster. It does a lot of the heavy lifting for you by abstracting away some of the computer-science-specific things, freeing you up to do more physics in less code (or at least that's how it was pitched to me).

Meanwhile in bioinformatics, I experience the total opposite. Just yesterday I needed to find out exactly what processor I had, so i could see if it have the SSE2 instruction set (it did), so that i could edit a Makefile that was complaining that I didn't have SSE2, so that i could install a shared library, that would allow me to parse my data, so i could being to do an analysis. I wish I could say such faffing around was rare, but it is unfortunately all too common. Furthermore, during lab meetings or presentations, no one ever talks about *how* the data was analysed - only that it was. Because very few biologists program and most that do are really just gluing tools together, very few people actually know how their data was analysed. It's creating a situation where the analysers of bioinformatic data are typically not biologists, but rather the bioinformaticians who wrote the tools, as they are the only ones who truly understand the intricacies of the tool/analysis. Thus, despite all these efforts to teach programming to biologists, i'm seeing biologists being pushed further and further away from programming, and becoming more and more complacent to just let other people tell them what their data is saying, in 3 charts or less.

There is some degree of hyperbole there. If one checks out /r/bioinformatics you will find many biologists who definitely understand their data - but my question to /r/Physics is do you think your field has benefitted from ROOT in a substantial way? Would other fields of science benefit from a domain-specific programming language like ROOT?"

Question about the infamous Washburn article 'The Dynamics of Capillary Flow',0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1485622231,True,"Hi everyone, sorry I'm not used to this subreddit, feel free to tell me if my submission is inappropriate.

So I was reading [this article](http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.17.273) because I need to have a good grasp of what Washburn did for my own graduate research and there are two things I don't understand at the beginning of the article. I was thinking that I would find help on this subreddit!

My first issue is with the Poiseuille's law washburn is using. He claims that it 'obviously takes the following form :

[; dV = \frac{\pi \sum P}{8 \eta l} \times (r\^4 + 4 \epsilon r\^3 ) dt ;] 

While the only form of the Poiseuille law I know and I've been able to find on the internet doesn't have the second term in r^3. Where does it come from ? I understand epsilon is a friction factor similar to that of the Darcy's laws but I'm not even sure.

My second question may be stupid but I don't understand how he derives (2) from (9). When I do the math I find that [; l_{0} ;] is half what is yield in two and and I don't understand why.

Thanks for your precious help fellow science lovers and redditors !

Question about inverted underwater brachistochrones.,3,10,False,False,False,Physics,1485637716,True,"I've been considering the effects of drag on a brachistochrone. Specifically, I've been thinking about a brachistochrone where the force driving the ball along the ramp isn't gravity but rather buoyancy. Consider an inverted underwater brachistochrone where the mass rolling along it is a ping pong ball. Since buoyancy is constant, it would seem that the curve would remain a cycloid if you neglect drag. But then you've got the fact that the effect of drag is proportional to the square of the velocity. What would such a curve look like? Is there a constant solution to this problem? My intuition is that the curve will vary depending on the distance to be traveled. This would indicate that such a brachistochrone is not a tautochrone. Is this intuition correct? Is there a known solution to this problem?"

I am a fourth year physics grad student focusing on computational condensed matter physics. I have used density functional theory to model solar cell and battery materials. Now that I am a good ways along my PhD I am fairly sure that I do not want to pursue an academic research position. 

My interests in the last year have switched to machine learning and data science. I have taken some classes and plan on putting together some projects while finishing up my thesis to help with job prospects.

I was fairly fortunate to get some early publications in my research work and I am on my last project now. I mostly stuck it out because I got a good head start in the field and felt like it would be foolish to leave. 

Was this a mistake? From my initial search job prospects in DFT outside academia are not very common and it seems like people expect a lot of background work when switching fields. Has anyone had any experience with this?"

A Heartfelt Request to the Physics Community,167,387,False,False,False,Physics,1486007310,True,"Dear All,

The (American) scientific community is in a state of crisis-- the magnitude of which is difficult to overstate. Many of our friends and colleagues are facing the most dire of situations, and they require the support and activism of the entirety of academia in this moment.  

In what may be a controversial gesture, I am breaking with the strict ""on-topic"" tradition of this subreddit to address the situation-- I truly hope that the other moderators with sympathize with, if not support this action. 

It is my opinion[1] that recent events concerning American politics have come to surface as, among other things, serious ***bipartisan Scientific*** *and Humanitarian issues*, and that the fate of science, and more importantly our scientists, is inextricably intertwined with the course of these policies.  Because of this, as a scientist and a member of this community, I feel that it is appropriate to take advantage of my cross-section with scientific readers to broadcast the following message:

[1] which is carefully defended below in a citation laden, fact-based message written by multiple active researchers of varying beliefs and backgrounds
_______
As many of you know, the current administration issued an executive order titled “Protecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States” on January 27. The full text of the order with annotation is available [here](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/31/512439121/trumps-executive-order-on-immigration-annotated)



In summary, the following restrictions are in place as of writing:

* Citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia are barred from entering the United States on any visa category
* Any refugees awaiting resettlement in the United States are barred from entering for 120 days
* All Syrian refugees are barred from entry to the United States indefinitely

Initially, the status of permanent residents of the United States, also known as “green card” holders, was in question, leading to the detention of over 100 permanent residents upon re-entering the country. On February 1, the current administration announced that the executive order will no longer apply to legal permanent residents. Additionally, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates stated on January 30 that she would not defend the legality of the order, prompting the administration to relieve Ms. Yates of her duties. To build on this misfortune, it has come to light that the current administration wishes to expand on these bans in the (near) future.


**This order has already impacted the scientific community** domestically and abroad in various ways, making it clear that this issue transcends partisan ideology and poses a direct threat to the success of future scientific endeavors. For a sample of the current effects and potential future ramifications, consider the following:

* Scientists at American institutions with dual or foreign citizenship in the impacted countries remain **unsure if they will be able to re-enter the country** (stories at Nature and Science are [here](http://www.nature.com/news/meet-the-scientists-affected-by-trump-s-immigration-ban-1.21389) and [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/scientists-lives-upended-trump-s-immigration-order))
* **Researchers** hoping to immigrate and become American citizens in order to pursue scientific interests **face uncertain futures, potentially reducing the nation’s talent pool**(story at Scientific American [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-immigration-ban-can-worsen-u-s-doctor-shortage-hurt-hospitals/))

* Academics across the country are calling for a **boycott of American scientific conferences and journals** (story at the Chronicle of Higher Education [here](http://www.chronicle.com/article/Academics-Mull-Boycott-of-US/239047))

In response to this action, members of the scientific community have outlined a course of action to safeguard the future of science in America. Over 9,000 U.S. faculty members and 44 Nobel Laureates have penned an open letter voicing their concerns regarding the executive order.

* In addition, please make your concerns heard by **contacting your United States Representative and Senators** – information may be found either [here](https://notoimmigrationban.com/call-for-action/index.html) or by a simple search for your legislators which will turn up results for their e-mail addresses, office phone numbers, and social media profiles. Each of these modes are an effective means of ensuring that your legislator is aware of your concerns, as many members of Congress make a point to be quite responsive to queries submitted in a variety of forms. Repeated contact is preferable, as it demonstrates that these concerns will not diminish until corrective action is taken. 

* Please contact the moderators of other science and academic groups (both subbreddits and non-reddit communities alike) and **request that they make similar posts in solidarity**, and perhaps leave them up through this Sunday.

* Gather amongst yourselves to form a well-informed, high-impact, **Scientific Activism community**, on reddit or otherwise, in an effort to save our community and the impacted individuals who make it up.

**Our Immigrants make Science Great.** Thank you for time and contribution!

___________________________________
Edit: 2/2/2017. There seems to be some push back here about this issue being a scientific issue, which is a central theme of this post, so I would like to expand on the previous arguments. Besides the **immediate, tangible impact** on science, scientists, and their collaborations already noted in the citation laden message above, there is a growing body of evidence that diversity in-and-of itself improves scientific endevours (as well as a long historical fossil record of community size v.s. progress). See the following articles [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/diversity-challenge-1.15930),
[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/),
[NPR](http://www.npr.org/2014/03/21/292225798/does-diversity-on-research-team-improve-quality-of-science). Therefore, to the *best of our knowledge* as scientists, we find that diversity and international collaboration are **positively correlated with output and impact**, with an exception for the most fringe cases. The events written about in this post have already affected this in widespread, detrimental ways, both directly and indirectly as noted above.  We then conclude that this issue is a **scientific issue** and not a matter of opinion or politics, until proven otherwise in a reputable and controlled study ."
Would a hydrophobic surface reduce the drag of an aerodynamic object traveling in air at all?,3,6,False,False,False,Physics,1486011086,True,"It has been shown that a superhydrophobic surface can significantly reduce the drag on an object submersed in water (not really experimentally shown on a large scale due to issues with surfactants I think). See this reference for instance:
Extraordinary drag-reducing effect of a superhydrophobic coating on a macroscopic model ship at high speed. By Hongyu Dong
I wanted to know if a drag reduction effect can still hold if we made two changes. i) the object was moved to air rather than water and ii) the surface was made to be hydrophobic rather than superhydrophobic.
My thinking is that if the object is traveling in air, there will still be a thin film of air pinned to the object, right? And this thin film will then help keep the surrounding flow laminar, or at least more laminar than without the hydrophobic coating. Of course, the drag might not see a significant reduction but I just want to know if it works at all."

Discussion Provoking Questions - HS Physics,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1486089688,True,"Hey fam. I want to compile a list of questions that get high school students talking to each other and discussing how physics works/why physics makes sense for different topics in physics.

Here are a couple that one of my colleagues and I have used in the past few weeks.

Ex 1. Impulse

Two eggs are dropped from a height of 2 m, but one is dropped onto the floor and the other is dropped onto a compressible surface. How do the eggs' momenta compare to each other as they fall side by side? How do their final momenta compare after they each hit the ground? What will happen to each egg after hitting the ground? How is it possible for one egg to crack and the other egg to come out unscathed if they both experience the same impulse?

Ex 2. Work/Power

A group of movers is being sent over by the moving company to help push your refrigerator from your front door into your kitchen. The company could send a group of three small movers or three large movers. Which group would have to do more work to move the fridge into the kitchen? *students discuss* (they usually figure out that both sets of movers are required to do the same amount of work) *students share answers* If the both sets of movers are being paid by the hour, which would you rather have move your furniture, considering they both end up doing the same work?

What are some interesting questions that you think would get students engaged in meaningful discussion, that might help dispel some common misconceptions?

This week I'm teaching about GPE, KE, and the Work-Energy Theorem, so if you have discussion provoking questions pertaining to those topics in particular, I'd love to hear 'em!"

Special Relativity - Does Heating an Object Increase Its Mass?,95,66,False,False,False,Physics,1486226435,True,"A student asked me this question a while back:

If E=mc^2, then something that has more energy should be more massive, right?  Well, if I heat a block of metal so that it has more energy (in the form of heat), does it weigh more, at least theoretically?

Hmm.  I'm an aerospace engineer and I have no idea what the answer is since I've never worked on anything that went fast enough to make me think about special relativity. My uninformed guess is that the block of metal would be more massive, but the change would be too small to measure.  I asked some physicists I know and, after an extended six-way internet conversation, they couldn't agree.  I appear to have nerd sniped them.

He is passionate about science, music (he loves Nightwish, plays trombone and likes cello, which I used used play), also does origami figures. We like to read and he likes Carl Salgan.

I was thinking about doing some kind of Monument Valley theme (a video game for mobile which if you haven't play, I (and he) highly recommend). Something like ""the laws of physics are being threatened""? But I think it is pretty crappy and a commodin/excuse idea in general.

Also, as I don't study physics I don't understand the equations, although I understand some concepts or what they explain -more or less- (like the Schrödinger equation), and I would like to use some of this concepts to make things more interesting. - Although maybe it is a bad idea that someone like me tries to use high level phisyc concepts, maybe I should stay in the safe-place and do a story without those deep details?

I hope this is the right place to ask this and I'm not intruding in this community ! (Apparently r/physic(s)gifts doesn't work).

Tl:dr: Do you have any ideas of what interesting excuse for a comic story (with my boyfriend as protagonist) realted to science/physics could I use?
And which and how I could introduce some deep science concepts?

Edit: if you could recommend me science fiction books that could fit with the comic idea I also would be so grateful!"

Is it normal to feel unprepared for physics research?,38,182,False,False,False,Physics,1486257866,True,"I started my PhD in theoretical physics recently and I'm having doubts on how well I know all the 'prerequisites'. It feels like I have some understanding of everything that I am supposed to know by now, but not much more than that - sometimes, the 'deep idea' and mastery of the details seem to be missing for me. 

Some examples: I know quantum mechanics, I can work with the formalism, but don't ask me to do something with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or compute energy levels of the hydrogen atom - I couldn't do it on the spot without a reference. I know the concept of special relativity and Lorentz transformations, but sometimes I get stuck on seemingly simple exercises in relativistic kinematics. I know how to integrate quite some functions, but I don't have the hands-on experience to do arbitrary 4d integrals that are thrown at me in Peskin & Schroeder. Speaking of which, after two years of exposure to QFT, I still wouldn't be able to fully renormalize a simple theory from beginning to end without referring to some textbook. Furthermore, I would be able to roughly give a definition of a particle state in QFT while referring to representations of the little group, but I would not _really_ understand and be able to defend what I'm saying. I know some of the inner workings of gauge theory, but if someone would ask me detailed conceptual questions about it, I'd quickly be at a loss for words (why _exactly_ do we employ the formalism of gauge theories, and what do they mean physically?).

The worst part is that these are the subjects that I should know the most about - I'd do even worse in statistical physics or solid state physics when things go beyond the basics.

During my master thesis I found that I was generally able to understand the project and the concepts involved to a sufficient level, but I had a way harder time 'going forward' and obtaining original results. I suspect that part of the reason is that I was never forced (and never really forced myself) to work out details by myself, instead of reading an argument or calculation over and over again until it made sense. I'm a little afraid that this won't change during my PhD, so my question is whether anyone else in physics research remembers similar doubts. In fact, I'd also be interested in hearing the 'opposite' case: people who felt like they deeply understood their field in detail by the time of starting a PhD, and how it played out for them.

Thanks a lot in advance!"

When I consider the possibility of time travel I always assume that going back in time cannot change the future. Example, someone goes back in time and kills Hitler to prevent the war. This action won't prevent the war, or perhaps won't happen at all, because the future you just travelled back from the war already happened. 

I appreciate there's no simple answer but if someone would be so kind as to explain briefly in layman's terms whether it is, or is not, possible to change the future by travelling back in time I would be very grateful.

Spacetime loaf of bread analogy help,3,2,False,False,False,Physics,1486294640,True,"I’m having a little trouble understanding an analogy in Greene’s “Fabric of the Cosmos.” I would be grateful for any attempts to explain this or to point me to some examples on the web. I’m reading about spacetime and the Greene equates spacetime with a loaf of bread that can be sliced at different angles. In Newton’s view, two observers at each side of the “loaf” would experience “now” at the same time which looks like a straight cut through the loaf of spacetime. Relativity says that if the observers are in motion then the cut through spacetime is at an angle and thus the spacetime loaf would be cut at an angle meaning that the observers “now” would be significantly different from each other.

 Greene gives an example of you and “Chewie” both sitting on a couch. Chewie is 10 billion light years away. Ignoring rotations of planets and stuff, if both you and Chewie are stationary then you two can say you experience the same now. HOWEVER, if Chewie gets up and walks at about 10 mph away from you – his now will be about 150 years before yours. If Chewie walks towards you – his now will be about 150 after you. 

So my question: If Chewie had a telescope that could see things happening on Earth - if he was travelling on his bike at 10mph, and turned his head to look through the telescope, would he see earth during the 1850s-60s? And then when he stopped moving and looked through that telescope again, he would see you on the park bench? I know the analogy isn't perfect, but is that the idea? 

Thank you very much

Learning physics with NVLD: practical tips and strategies?,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1486307221,True,"Hello,

I'm new here, please be nice. :)

I'm a former physics student who has recently rekindled an interest in physics after a period of being utterly burnt out as a student. It feels great: I'm interested in physics for the sake of it rather than feeling like I'm going through the motions. I've begun to *cautiously* wade into the ""math/physics"" gym-going to start with Griffiths E&M, in tandem with a couple of MIT OCW math courses, and see where it goes from there-and have a tentative course of action for getting back into studying during my spare time.

So, to the point. I largely made a mess out of college, for a host of reasons academic and non-academic. I got better with time, but I never reached the level I really needed to be to do a doctorate in physics, and it showed. Most of these issues, I know how to fix or at least (in the case of dealing with Churchill's ""black dog"" and some of my personal idiosyncrasies) practically handle in a way I didn't as a student. However, one thing I learned only a few months ago was, as a teenager, when I was being diagnosed with an unrelated mental disorder, I was also pointed at by the doctors to have some non-verbal learning disorder that I didn't even know existed until I actually read the diagnosis for the first time. I'm still a little skeptical-and I'm no doctor-but I've recently looked it, and the symptoms do make sense. It's a bit of an inhibition for physics, because spatial and abstract thinking is very crucial, and it was endlessly frustrating as a student to be able to seemingly understand things quickly but having a hard time practically visualizing something or drawing diagrams.

So, does anybody here know anything about this and have some practical tips on how to get around this when learning physics and math? I'd imagine it is something like dyslexia and reading: there has to be practical strategies to tackle it. I'm a failure as a man in a lot of regards, but one thing i do have on my side is persistence and stubbornness-that worked against me, actually, as a student when I very clearly needed to leave school and get my shit together. This will probably be a help. But it would be fantastic if I could make learn mathematics better by being more conscious of how my brain works. I'm already thinking of some ideas, but I'd love to consult the forum and see if anyone has anything to offer.

Thank you. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense or I'm rambling here, I've got a lot to do today.

(The thing is: I've never been very good at physics compared to many subjects. I really love it: it has made me into a far better person. But I'm not good at it, and my math is so rusty... Again, I plan on submitting a more in depth, personal post on this later, on whether it is all a waste of time, but I'd rather keep focused on practical strategies for this specific aspect of it for now. I'm under no illusions of being a professor or anything, to be sure: if I go to graduate school, I just want to do research for 5 years, learn some new cool things with math and computers, and then get a cool but not necessarily related job.)"

A question on time travel. Sort of...,8,6,False,False,False,Physics,1486323601,True,"I'm curious about an idea i've been mulling over this morning. If we can create a form of faster than light travel,  then could we chase after the light that has left the earth? If we could go fast enough we could catch up with the light from the beginning of earth's history. 

With sophisticated enough technology we could see the earth from that distance and observe the history of our planet. Including every single thing every person ever did. 
 Maybe we could make a copy of all the information and create a simulation based on it and use it to most accurately observe history and to ""travel back in time"" without really being able to affect our own time, but we could even participate in it if we could truly observe it in enough detail to create a realistic simulation. 

Its not quite time travel but it would be pretty neat. 

Of course this is all just assuming we can create this kind of technology one day. 

Thoughts?

Beginner's tutorials on Valleytronics (Spin-Valley Physics) in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs)?,3,2,False,False,False,Physics,1486397673,True,"Hello, I am a newly-minted ""physicist"", having completed my PhD in strong field ionisation of noble gas atoms. For my postdoc, I was recently introduced to the [monolayer Group VI Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD)](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v10/n4/full/nphoton.2015.282.html), which has been the hot topic in photonics.

Some of the terminology is new to me, especially this idea of valley pseudospin. From what I understood, the valleys are extremum points (maxima/minima, respectively) in the valence/conduction bands, and they can be controlled and manipulated just like the spin of an electron. Do they act as an entity all by itself, like a hole wavepacket left behind after ionisation? Or are they simply an ensemble of available states (for the electrons) in that momentum space, like the quantum states of an atom?

I would like to come to a better understanding of this concept, and have clearer idea of what this phenomenon entails. I have been looking around for some tutorials on this, but it seems to be mostly mentioned in research papers. There were some slides on it, but there was no rigorous theoretical discussion of the topic. At present, I only have [this paper](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.196802) to look forward to reading, and hopefully better understand this subject.

Speeding vehicle around a corner,4,3,False,False,False,Physics,1486401094,True,"My questions come from some experiences I've had in peoples' cars recently, which makes me wonder at what speed would a vehicle have to go to tip over while going around a corner.

Corner angle: sharp 25deg, meandering 45deg.

Obviously there are lots of variables, weight of vehicle, centre of gravity, what the passengers and cargo are doing inside, angle of the road, angle of the corner/turn, tires etc etc etc but just was wondering if there is some average speed which would be considered on the edge to tipping. I ride a motorbike and its common practice to lean into the corner you're going around, but I find in cars and buses (especially if the driver is speeding) most passengers just go with the centrifugal (?) force.

You're top mod of physics.  I'm near [the bottom of the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/about/moderators/).  You could de-mod me for defying you (hell, Automoderator could de-mod me).  No one can de-mod you except the reddit admins.

While it may look like I'm the only working mod in r/physics, there are five of us that regularly convene to discuss how things are going and if I'm doing the right things.  I've fucked up plenty, and the advice and guidence of the others have really helped me.  I like to think of us as a team, and I feel lucky to have their trust.  So in what follows I have to make it clear that I speak solely for myself.

Every day for the past two years this has been my routine:  I get up early and clean out the spam, the shitposts, the kickstarters, the shitty youtubers, the lazy bloggers, the clickbaity microtransaction farmers.  Then I notify the sincere posters who don't know the rules that they should move their posts into the appropriate thread, or to r/askphysics.  Then I deal with our regular crackpots/trolls who periodically create new accounts to sneak back into the sub to tell us that the luminiferous aether *is* dark matter and that the Unruh effect *can* make microwave ovens fly.  Then, I take copious notes on which users like to unload on naifs and young'uns, and step in when it turns into harassment.  Then I might spend some time writing bots to look for brigaders and other coordinated attackers of the sub.  Like I said, I have done this every day for the last two, almost three, years.  

What have you done for r/physics in that time?  You don't moderate, except to [sticky your posts](http://i.imgur.com/K2ClKO1.png) and [silence your critics](http://i.imgur.com/idbL14i.png).  You don't participate in mod discussions (you were invited but chose to absent yourself).  We've hardly [seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/search?q=author%3Aquaz4r&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  your account over the years.  When you do show up, it's to push your own agenda by stickying and mod-flairing your appeals.  Do I have to enumerate the reasons why this is bad?  I can flesh out the details if you like, but I'd rather get to the point of my request.

**Please**, de-mod yourself.  I will invite you back.  You can still be a mod, just not top mod.  When you have a personal or political issue that intersects with physics, we can work together to craft it into a form that minimizes drama, doesn't alienate sincere subscribers, and makes it *even more effective*.  Please, let's work together.  Believe me, it's good not to have ultimate authority.  As bottom mod, you have to get along with the rest of the team.  You have to listen and take advice.  It's good for you, good for me, good for the modteam, and ultimately good for r/physics.

Not sure what's actually happening with the air, and therefore not sure if my design is fundamentally feasible. (x-post /r/askphysics)",5,7,False,False,False,Physics,1486466995,True,"http://imgur.com/7YTX8Zd

My idea is to have the center axle with all the proper cutouts and ratios (tuning these is another issue entirely, input very welcome*), and have each one separated by stationary dividers, between which I'll fashion a uniform clamping system sort of like a camera shutter to bring evenly spaced blocks inwards radially.  This clamping will be directly linked to the keys with levers and such. 

What I'm not sure of is what's happening in terms of specific aerodynamics, whether having these separating disks would prevent interference from neighboring notes (as there would be a slight space between the stationary dividers and the moving axle piece), and what would happen as the blocks clamp into position- would the volume ramp in smoothly?  or would there be a whole bunch of whistling?  Could I use that to my advantage?  maybe embed little flutes or buzzy kazoo paper in the base of each block or something?

If anyone has the ability to simulate the airflow of even a basic air raid siren set up, I would be immensely grateful.  I get the basic idea of compression and rarefaction, I'm just a little lost on the specific airflow and by extension how this design might be optimally approached. 

Thanks for any help!

*specifically on the problem of tuning, would the openings need to be evenly spaced?  If you divide 360 degrees by various integers, the ratios are going be fixed.  Unless I design the whole thing with some crazy system of gears to get the notes spinning at different speeds... I just feel like changing pitch by the number of openings and having the axle as a solid thing is way safer. 

However, if a 100 cent difference in pitch amounts to a few millimeters difference in the openings, by the time you repeat that length around the wheel, it adds up to a considerable break in regularity.  If the clamping blocks had the same irregularity, would it still work?  And would it achieve the difference in pitch?  If only a small, rotating portion of the cycle is not in perfect sync, would the rest of the aligned and working parts make up for it?  I would have to compensate for weight distribution with this approach, but these are just some initial thoughts I've got.  I'd love to hear your thoughts."

Here is the thought experiment. Suppose if I knew a person's height I could determine her weight with a 90% accuracy. Further suppose that if I knew a person's age I could predict her weight with a 90% accuracy. However, if I only know the person's age, I can predict her height with an 60% accuracy.

In this case, the two initial assumptions imply that I must be able to determine the person's height from her age with at least an 80% accuracy but the third assumption contradicts them, which means that there is no fixed correlation among the variables in question before they are measured."

Astrophysical situation to test my idea?,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1486659797,True,"Question  
---  
I believe the following uncertainty principle to be true in the regime [; v << c ;] :  
  
[; \Delta g \Delta p \geq | \langle \dot U \rangle - \langle p \rangle \langle g \rangle| ;]   

Is there any astrophysical situation which can test this?   
  
Background  
---  
I recently had the following idea in the regime of quantum mechanics and gravity [; v << c ;] : we can the Heisenberg picture we define an acceleration operator and using Einstein's equivalence principle we state it must be equivalent to $g$ operator (quantum mechanical version of [; g ;] field) and thus we proceed to find an uncertainty principle.  
  
Mathematical Details
---
We use the heisenberg picture to define velocity [; \hat v ;]   
    
[; \hat v =  [H,x] / i \hbar  ;]   
    
Now we can again differentiate to get acceleration [; \hat a ;]  
   
[; \hat v =  [[H,x],x]  / i \hbar^2  ;]   
  
We can simplify the calculation by splitting the Hamiltonian into potential  [;  V  ;]  and kinetic energy [;  T ;] : [;  H =  T +  V ;]  
  
By noticing (one can also calculate this) that the acceleration of an object in a constant potential is [; 0 ;] :  
  
[; \hat 0 = \hat T^2 x + x  \hat T^2 - 2 \hat T  \hat x  \hat T ;]  
  
We also know [; [\hat V, \hat x]  ;]  = 0 $ as potential is a function of position. Thus, we can simplify acceleration as:  
  
[; \hat a = \hat V \hat T \hat x + \hat x \hat T \hat V - \hat V \hat x \hat T - \hat T \hat x \hat V ;]  
  
Now from the equivalence principle we know that the effect of acceleration is indistinguishable from gravity. Using this fact:  
  
[; \hat g = \hat a ;]  
  
However, [; \hat g ;] does not commute with $\hat p ;] (it commutes with position). Using the anti-commutator (rather than the commutator) we should observe:  
    
[; \Delta g \Delta p \geq | \langle \dot U \rangle - \langle p \rangle \langle g \rangle| ;]     
  
By Schwatz inequality [; | \langle \dot U \rangle - \langle p \rangle \langle g \rangle| ;] is [; 0 ;] only when [; U ;] is constant.

Are permanent magnets sending current through free space?,8,0,False,False,False,Physics,1486686589,True,"Units of magnetic field are A/m or N/(m*A) does this mean permanent magnets are sending current through free space in a perpetual loop? How does this not violate conservation of energy? How is it sending these currents through free space without power loss everywhere and heat loss in the air? 

Wouldn't it also need some absurd E-Field to perform this current exchange? Just like circuits need a huge voltage to arc to anything.

And if it is sending current through space, doesn't that imply that there is also an electric field relation? resistivity of free space is 377Ω. and (E/H)=Resistance so permanent dipoles are actually generating some power loss of P=IR (P/M2) = (E*H).

Basically...what on earth is going on?

Also, what does this imply for maxwell's 3rd equation? a moving current induces a rotating current???...I feel like I am deeply confused about something here.

What is light exactly? (Electromagnetic waves),18,1,False,False,False,Physics,1486687605,True,"I've read many articles and sources, but I feel like they are a bit vague. They often say that it is electromagnetic waves that oscillate through space. But what does that mean? How can I picture this in my head? Is it a vibration of the fabric of space that causes light to be what it is?

How can I better understand what these ""waves"" are, the ocean waves are easy to imagine because it is waves that travel through water, so do electromagnetic waves travel through something being space? In that case, what is space exactly? Is space absolutely everwhere? Including in us? So rather than space surrounding matter, matter travels through space as if it just blends into it?

The answer is that water level rises & oil level falls. I read the explanation to it but did not understand it at all. :( 
So, when an ice cube melts in just water, the water level does not rise. Why is this not the case when there's oil. Could someone explain this simply using either common sense or the buoyancy force formula? thank you so muchhhh!

Does higher internet speed use more power?,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1486705301,True,"This might seem like a ISP question, but I thought posting here would get me more accurate answers since I'm wondering about energy and its relation to price.

Besides reasons of greed and business, I was wondering why your monopoly ISP (in the USA) might charge different prices for different speeds.

Do higher speeds result in more energy being spent, thus the higher costs, or do all speeds use the same amount of energy?

I started univerisity awhile back in circa 2004.  I was majoring in physics but did not end up finishing my degree.  I got 2/3 of the way done.

I am wondering if anybody has heard of Louis Essen, Herbert Dingle, or W. D. MacMillan?  My university had a little book, pamphlet like, of Louis Essen's called ""The Special Theory of Relativity"".  It peaked my interest and pretty soon I was beginning to have doubts with Special Relativity.  Now, I totally understand that it is a viable working theory; it has been corroborated with much evidence.

It isn't wrong.  But then, when you read what these three gentleman have written against relativity you cannot believe Special Relativity is completely right either.  It has some fundamental logical qualms.  Now, I believe I have created a new theory which wholly encapsulates the Special Relativity and extends it, without making any qualms.

Gravitational Waves Anniversary Poster,2,19,False,False,False,Physics,1486805783,True,"Hi r/physics, 

I'm a physics enthusiast and bodgering entrepreneur. Around about eight months ago a graphic-designing friend of mine and I thought that we would try to launch a poster to celebrate the anniversary of the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO, as a side project from our day jobs. 

We set out on our mission, using the standard blue-ripples image that was on the NASA press release as inspiration (https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/ns_gw_art.jpg) and got feedback from users from r/physics (u/CarbonRodOfPhysics, u/TBON, u/TibetanBook, u/ComicFoil, u/fishify and u/ulidtko) to turn it into something with accurate physics and a good artistic look.

You can see the final image here: http://imgur.com/a/yveeH 

We like the idea of having physics on your wall as art, but wanted to add some more credibility to the poster as well as do our bit of good for the world, so we reached out to The Institute Of Physics. They are a London based charity who are on a mission to make sure that physics delivers on its potential for society. They run workshops which teach scientists the skills needed to turn their innovations into businesses, and so liked the idea of joining us on our entrepreneurial quest. They became the official partner of the project and we are giving them 30% of the proceeds. 

They hooked us up with some of the members of the LIGO team, three of which agreed to sign 100 of the posters (physics art signed by the scientific artists) and one of them agreed to be in a video for the poster. 

You can see our project and the video here:

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-gravitational-waves-anniversary-poster-art-design/x/15610040#/

We have produced one black and white poster and one black on black (where we print black ink onto black paper) to pay tribute to the collision of the two black holes (no light!).

It is priced in £ (as we are based in the UK), but ships globally and prices are listed in $ on the poster descriptions too.

Thank you for reading.

Getting started on self-studying Griffiths E&M. Helpful advice for someone who has been out of physics for a while.,16,15,False,False,False,Physics,1486828064,True,"So... I've decided to take the plunge and start seeing if getting back into physics is a possibility. Whether physics graduate school is possible down the road, I have absolutely no idea, but I've decided that this is worth doing anyway. :)

The road of a thousand miles begins with a single step, no?

Here are my questions:

1) I've already gone through Chapter 1 and have done a few problems, nothing too major since my time for the next month is going to be very limited, but with representation throughout the chapter-did some of the ones at the back. I've noticed that I'm not *quite* as rusty as I thought with vector calculus, so that is a somewhat encouraging sign. That being said, PDEs are a different matter, I suspect. Will that be a problem for Griffiths, going through it? I barely remember Green's Functions and would probably struggle to go through the mechanics of solving Laplace's Equation if asked to do so as of now. Does Griffiths assume you already know PDEs in depth, or does it take you through what you need to know in Chapter 3? 

2) My physics ""intuition"" skills, I fear, are similarly rusty. I know that there's no way around this other than practice and hard work, but are there any ways I can speed up the process of reviving them, being out of a student environment? Maybe find a single study-buddy once my personal situation stabilizes a little, to meet up a few times a week and work problems, discuss it, etc?

3) Is there anybody else here who left physics for a bit, and came back, or is an otherwise ""nontraditional"" student of physics? If so, any pieces of advice you have?

PS:

4) Should I proceed on to Chapter 2, even though I haven't done all the problems from Chapter 1, seeing as that seems to be mostly a vector calc review? 

(I should probably clarify this-I've already taken an E&M course as a physics student, so I'm familiar with most of the material in the first half of the book and can at least follow the gist of the physics involved, the examples, etc. But that was four years ago now, so to say I'm a little rusty with actually crunching stuff is charitable. Not to mention that my study/learning habits at the time were absolutely terrible, so I probably didn't get near as much as I should have from it.)

PSS:

Wow, holy crap, I didn't expect to get so many responses! This forum is going to be a great resource, methinks.

I'll answer some of you once I get off work today. "

Question about time travel from a mathematical perspective,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1486844424,True,"I've been thinking a bit about time travel, and why I feel that my perspective of it should be correct. Being a mathematician (full disclosure, I'm only on my 2nd year at the university), I thought I would tackle it mathematically, however, I am going to assume a lot, so I feel like I need some input from someone with a physics background. Anyway, here we go:

If time can be thought of as a function, f(t), from 4-dimensional space into 4-dimensional space, moving a point around the surface of spacetime, I think it is fair to assume that this function will be continuous. Being continuous implicates, when t1 and t2 are arbitrarily close, so will the points f(t1) and f(t2) be arbitrarily close by whatever metric is used with regards to spacetime. However, if a point on the function in spacetime is far enough away from another point, they would not necessarily affect each other, correct? So what I am trying to say is, that one point in time is not necessarily affected by another, so if backwards time travel was possible, and you arrived at some point in the past, you and your actions would have an effect on that time, and time would diverge. If that is true, it loosely contradicts the point I was making before, that one point in time doesn't necessarily affect another. Therefore, what I am proposing is, that either backwards time travel is impossible, or if you could travel back in time, you wouldn't actually be travelling in time, but moving to another function of spacetime. What I am getting at is, that if you traveled back in time (or forward, for that matter), you disappear from our timeline (function) completely, and create an entirely new one. Thus, traveling back to kill Hitler, for example, would result in a new timeline without him (and with you stuck in that time), but everyone who did not travel with you would be stuck in our timeline, and nothing would have changed. Also, trying to travel back to the future would yet again create a new timeline, so that you would, in essence, completely disappear from timeline 2, never to be seen again.

I hope this was somewhat coherent. I also apologise for probably getting a lot of the concepts (both mathematical and physical) wrong, but this is why I felt like I needed input from professionals :)

Also, I feel like I lack the know-how to set up a rigorous mathematical framework of time, which is why I for example use the words ""loosely contradicts"". "

Optimize field strength of array of disc magnets,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1486915896,True,"I'm making one of these wooden [magnet bars](http://www.startwoodworking.com/sites/default/files/uploads/1/671/knifeholder.jpg) to hold knifes. I make about 30 holes in the back of the wood, such that the bottom is about 1.5 mm from the surface (which will end up as the front where the knifes are hanging). I then glue in disc shaped neodynium magnets. I leave about a centimeter of solid wood between the holes, so as to minimize weakening the front surface of the wood

Since the knifes are held on due to friction, proportional to the normal force, I was wondering if there is a way to optimize the field strength of the magnets by varying the way the poles face.  Last time I made one of these bars, I glued in the magnets with the same pole facing forward for all of the magnets, but I recently became aware of the [Halbach arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halbach_array). Is there any way to exploit this or something similar with disc shaped magnets that are 1cm apart? Or do any of you know other tricks I could utilize to maximize the strength of the forward facing field?

Question on Faraday's Law,7,8,False,False,False,Physics,1486920144,True,"If you drop a magnet through a solenoid (such as in [THIS](https://youtu.be/ClFQQ0uzst4?t=32) video), you will see two brief voltage spikes. The first spike occurs as the magnet is entering the solenoid, and the second occurs as the magnet is leaving the solenoid.  

I understand why the signs of these two spikes are opposite. But why are their **magnitudes** not equal to each other? The first spike always seems to have a slightly higher magnitude than the second spike.  

The voltage is of course determined by the rate at which the magnetic flux is changing. So I guess that would mean that the flux is changing more rapidly when the magnet is entering the solenoid, compared to when it is leaving. But why is that?"

The merry-go round is a cylinder. (I=1/2 mr^2 ) After one full revolution, what will the angular velocity be?

I know that I can solve for angular acceleration and inertia, but without either linear velocity or time I haven't been able to solve for angular velocity.

I also have tried to calculate it using rotational kinematics formulas, but I always am left needing either angular velocity or time.

Are we interpreting the relationship between Bell's inequality and experiment in the right way?,20,18,False,False,False,Physics,1487054601,True,"Read the post before downvoting or removing, thanks.

Hopefully you can kill my confusion instead of silencing it.
  
First, let's do what we agree on:  
  
*In local theories, each measurement must always be opposite for the same direction. In non local theories, that's also the case.  
  
This is the common interpretation of the violation of Bell's inequality by the experiment:  
  
*In local theories with well defined spins, the possible results are either all x for A and all -x for B (when the same detector is selected), or x | x | -x for A and -x | -x | x for B (which is mathematically equivalent to all cases when a different door is picked). Drawing a matrix we arrive at Bell's inequality for different doors: 
  
A1B1 | X, -X | A2B1 | X, -X | A3B1 | -X, -X |  
A1B2 | X, -X | A2B2 | X, -X | A3B2 | -X, -X |  
A1B3 | X,  X | A2B3 | X,  X | A3B3 | -X, X |  
  
Bell inequality predicts that the measurements are different 5/9 of the time. 
   
*In undefined spins theories, the result in A changes the possibility of results in B. In the vertical and 60 degrees experiment, when A is found x for for vertical, then B must be 3/4 -x for either 60°.  Then we multiply 3/4 by 2/3 and arrive at 50%.
  
*Ok. Now let's put the possible results for the undefined spins in a matrix: 
  
A1B1 | X, -X      | A2B1 | X, -X 3/4| A3B1 | -X, -X ?|  
A1B2 | X, -X 3/4| A2B2 | X, -X      | A3B2 | -X, -X ?|  
A1B3 | X,  X 1/4| A2B3 | X,  X 1/4| A3B3 | -X, X    |   
  
This matrix is following the rules that: when measuring the same direction, then the spin must be opposite for the same direction. When A or B is x in the vertical, then B or A must be -x 3/4 in one of the inclined planes. I don't know the expected rates for when the inclined plane is measured first, which is why there are question marks there. Can someone shed a light here? I'd guess A3B1 is also 1/4 for B1; but I'm not so sure about A3B2. The important bit is that these are only 3/4 or 1/4 because the directions are vertical, -60° and +60°. They would be different for other directions, but still equivalent (if the ratios were 4/5 instead, then every 3/4 can be translated to a 4/5 and every 1/4 to a 1/5).
  
Now here are the questions:  
* Why are we ignoring the possibilities A1B1, A2B2, A3B3 for the undefined spins expected ratio and considering them for Bell's inequality expected ratio?   
* This is the important one. Why are we assuming that the particle must behave classicaly in a **local hidden variable quantum theory** and it must obey quantum mechanics when the spins are undefined? Why can't it be that in the case of the local hidden variable theories, the predictments of the quantum mechanics happen when the particle is created and, thus, we should have the same matrix as the one proposed for the undefined spins theories? Why can't it be that the quantum process responsible for defining an axis happens when entangled particles are created, instead of when they are measured? If this happens, then it doesn't seem like we should expect Bell's inequality to hold, even in **valid** local hidden variable theories, which should properly account for the quantum phenomenea. It doesn't seem like the experiment rules out local hidden theories when the spin is well defined, but undefinable by an observer until the measurements are made.
  
EDIT: For everyone who still can't understand. The matrix for possibilities for a LHV theory that doesn't account for quantum predictments looks like Bell's inequality requirement: 5/9. The second matrix is the range of possibilities when two different doors are selected, properly accounting for quantum predictments. If quantum mechanics said that measuring the vertical would NOT affect the chance that inclined would be measured in any direction, then how would this second matrix look like? Exactly like the Bell's inequality one. So, if quantum theory said that, then Bell's inequality should be expected to be conserved in reality. Since it doesn't, then Bell's inequality should be broken if quantum predictments are correct. Similary, if a LHV theory were to accept quantum predictments when the entanglement is created, instead of when it's measured, then the expected matrix for this theory should also be the second one. Then how can we assume that by Bell's inequality being broken in experiments, we can also rule out ALL LHV theories?"

What books must I absolutely read?,8,3,False,False,False,Physics,1487077952,True,"Hello, you beautiful nerds.

I'm currently in my second year of college, and will transfer to university soon. I am currently taking Differential Equations, and have taken up to Calculus 3. I am also taking University Physics 2 (electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, etc). I will be taking subjects like Modern Physics next semester.

Before I arrive at university, what books should I have read? My current professor recommended us Fermi's book on thermodynamics. I haven't asked about other subjects. I am also (trying to) reading Quantum Mechanics by David J. Griffiths. I understand some basic concepts behind the weirdness of quantum mechanics, but I have a hard time following the mathematics sometimes. 

So I suppose I am looking for books that help me understand:

 how statistics is applied to QM.

 derivation of wave functions and their  usage.

And honestly any other concepts that you think I must master. I'm open to also refreshing classical mechanics (torque, tensions, etc).

Thank you.

PS. Oh I'm also reading this [book](http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/ahtt.html) right now."

So far what I have done is the following:
In this case, the stone is going to follow an elliptical rather than parabolic trajectory.  Since the moon is a sphere, I can find the distance L by L=R*(theta).  

In order to find theta, I solved the kepler equation r(theta)=c/(1+e*cos(theta))  [e is epsilon] for theta to get 

theta = arccos( [(c/r)-1]/e  )  
Call (c/r)-1]/e  ""(*)

How does the nuclear physics community view pyroelectric fusion?,15,0,False,False,False,Physics,1487135921,True,"I came across [this article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/pdf/nature03575.pdf) in Nature from 2005.

   D + D --> *^3*He + n 

All of this occurs at near room temperature and within a tabletop setup.

In reading more about it, I gathered that the idea behind the experiment has been floating around for the last 20 years or so.
I realize that this (as the authors point out) is not a means for power generation but this still astounds me.

I have been watching a bunch of vsauce and kurzgesgat videos, and this is what (I think) I heard about Hawking radiation:

* It is the mechanism by which black holes decay

* The reason energy can escape the black hole is because of particle-antiparticle pairs are formed close to the event horizon, but one of them falls into the blackhole and the other radiates out

In this case, why would the blackhole lose energy by Hawking radiation? Aren't the particles trapped near the event horizon adding energy to the black hole (and the universe) instead of the blackhole losing energy?

If the particle-antiparticle pairs are not the reason for Hawking Radiation, why is that energy able to escape the gravitational fields?

Will we experience another 'Heroic Age' of Physics like the period of 1890-1940?,56,48,False,False,False,Physics,1487251264,True,"So many titans of Nuclear Physics and Chemisty made so so many amazing discoveries during this period, Scientists  such as Pauli, Bohr, Rutherford, Einstein, Wigner, Oppenheimer, Geiger  Hiesenberg, Lawrence, Frisch, Chadwick among many others, all famous and accomplished scientists in their own right, all lived and worked during the same periods, often together.

My question to the scientific community is this. Is the world due again for another  breakneck period of discovery in nuclear and standard physics and chemistry or have we reaped all the low hanging fruit already? I know we have made serious discoveries in quantum mechanics and particle physics but to me these advances dont seem to have the same gravitas as the enormous  leaps made in the early 20th century.

Who are the Bohr's and Rutherford's and Pauli's etc of the day?

Rick and Infinity - Fun Analysis of Rick and Morty,17,7,False,False,False,Physics,1487346606,True,"I want to start of by saying I am not a physicist. I love the subject, but I am an idiot, so please pardon my poor interpretations.



*Background:*

For those of you who don't know Rick and Morty is a cartoon about a dimension hopping apathetic genius scientist Rick and his grandson Morty. Rick explains in the show that there are infinite universes and he travels between those universes with use of his portal gun. 


The show is ridiculous in many ways and has a sarcastic sense of humor not seen in many other shows. Science and physics play a big part in the show, although interpreted by writers and not scientists. Obviously most of the science is at best purely hypothetical and at worst just plain wrong. The show is hilarious if you have a darker sense of humor and if you haven't seen it I suggest you watch starting on episode 2 of season 1. I love this show and would love to hear some of your input on the science of the show. 



Consider this a thought experiment/ journal club type of analysis - just for giggles if you may.



*To Note:* There is no definitive statement made in the show to explain which concept of multiple or infinite universes they are using. I assume that the writers are using a Many-Worlds Interpretation simply because they say infinite universes. As I understand some other multiverse theories, which I am incorrect about surely, there may be a finite number of universes. Since the show says infinite, I assume MWI.



**Rick and Infinity**
In the episode [Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Close_Rick-counters_of_the_Rick_Kind) Rick is arrested by the Council of Ricks, a bureaucratic organization of Ricks from other universes. At one point a member of the Council states that our Rick (Rick C-137) is part of the *central finite curve*. 


This brings up a few questions I would like to pose to this sub:

* **1)Is the central finite curve a 'real' thing considering an infinite number of universes?**


Another redditor has explained the central finite curve ...

> ""It's the part of the universe in which Ricks exist. Imagine infinity as a straight line. Point A on the line marks where Ricks start. Point B marks where they end. Nowhere else in all infinity do Ricks exist. This makes this segment of the line of infinity, finite. The ""Curve"" in "" Central Finite Curve"" refers to the Gaussian function , which is essential in calculating the diffusion of Ricks in the universe; and when graphed produces a bell shaped curve. It is only central in the sense that it is central to the perspective of Ricks that exist. Or maybe the writers thought it sounded like something a smart dude would say. It could also be a dick joke .""




* **2) Considering that there are an infinite number of universes would there not also be an infinite number of Ricks?** (I keep thinking the term ""nested infinities"" which I have no idea if it's a real thing or not, but it sounds like it may be)


I understand that the Council and other Ricks seen in the show might be part of one distribution of Ricks and there may be many more distributions of Ricks unseen to the viewer. As I understand infinity, which I am sure is incorrect, it is endless and with no limit; anything that is possible then is. So with infinity then there are infinite Ricks of infinite varieties and even infinite Councils of Ricks and infinite number of universes with Ricks and etc.

Why is reflection directional?,20,97,False,False,False,Physics,1487424721,True,"Can someone explain reflection or refraction using a particulate nature of light.
I sort of get the idea of reflection. In that light doesn't really bounce off any material, it is absorbed causing a dipole and these dipoles reradiate light like many little antennae.
The question is then why do we observe the feature of angle of incidence =angle of reflection. Naively it implies it reradiates light preferentially knowing the direction it come from.
I can sort of picture this using Feynman path integrals and path of least resistance but I was hoping Reddit may provide a more coherent explanation .

Ask the teacher for help. Do the problem , get it a little more correct. Or look at the solutions after doing the problem wrong to get it right. 

There are no solutions and the teacher is not inclined to help. 

A tutor is not readily available. 

Online help is not assuring.

Thinking out the problem leads to the problem being impossible to check(therefore wrong)

Is it possible to send a message faster than the speed of light?,6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1487481713,True,"I believe to have heard that it is impossible to transmit a message faster than the speed of light. However, if you have a stick that is 10 million km long and you push one side, wouldn't the other end move instantly, thus making you able to transmit a message faster than the speed of light?
The way I see it there are two possibilities, either the other end doesn't move instantly, or it is not impossible to transmit a message faster than the speed of light, so which one is it?

Edit: First question answered. What happens with electricity inside of a cable? Do electrons also have a pressure wave for pushing the next one, or does it travel at light speed?"

I agree you can never reach it, obviously, but if we are just trying to get CLOSE to C how about this idea. 

Imagine a car driving on a long track made of radioactive material. 

If it absorbs the radiation through the base and shoots it out the back as it's means of acceleration, then as the car hits .9 C it will be getting 3x the energy per unit time. When it hits .99 C it will be getting 7x the energy. at .999 c it will be getting 22x the energy per unit of time for itself. . . 

Won't that cause a feedback loop where the car will keep accelerating even though the energy requirements grow? I grasp any finite radioactive fuel source would expire before the car could reach C, but perhaps this method could get us closer to C than ever before?

Photoelectric effect in quantum realm,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1487496440,True,"The photoelectric effect is explained as that if a photon of energy more than the work function is absorbed by an electron, the electron will overcome the energy binding material, it is well supported by Bohr's model of atom where an electron can jump to n=$\infty$ provided a photon of required energy is absorbed.

(I am equating the photoelectric electron emission   to excitation of an electron from its ground state to n=$\infty$ in Bohr model)

Now as Bohr model is obsolete, How does the uncertainty principle,  Hund's rules and probability distribution(which says that an electron ha a non-zero probability of being located at very large distances) deviate or modify or accommodates in photoelectric effect?

How general is the boundary condition obtained from Faraday's law?,6,5,False,False,False,Physics,1487560796,True,"I am referring to the condition that the tangential components of the electric field must be continuous across an interface.

 Is this valid in complete generality? I am thinking that if the rate of change of an external magnetic field is high enough, this condition would break down.

Also why shouldn't the LHS also go to 0 in this case?

On one further note: tt occurs to me that since the laws of reflection and refraction can be obtained from this condition, a rapidly changing magnetic field affecting reflection/refraction would be experimental evidence that it breaks down. Has this been observed?

College is ruining physics for me. Or maybe I am,8,8,False,False,False,Physics,1487655063,True,"Ever since I took my first physics class (Sophomore year in high school) I've known I want to do this with my life. I have other hobbies and goals outside of physics of course, but it is my 'career' passion. I love it. I bought tons of pop physics (and even some advanced physics) books and used to read them in my spare time.

Then I started going to college for physics. My physics fun books got put down and swapped for fiction, and I started to only focus on physics where my classes were concerned. I am now in my 3rd year of my BS in physics (planning on getting my Doctorate) and I am now enrolled in a Quantum Physics course and I am getting *so* discouraged. With every semester my faith in myself has dropped a little. My grades are C's and always have been.. I'm just worried that they'll get worse. I feel so dumb compared to my classmates, and this Quantum course is making all of this more obvious than ever. I don't know if I'm just stupid or if I'm not cut out for physics, I really love it but it is so exhausting to continuously put forth all of my effort and barely scrape by while some people seemingly have no problem with it. I feel constantly behind, and like maybe it's too late to catch up to this level. I feel like I don't belong in a physics class intellectually because of how overwhelmed I am getting from it all but I love physics so much, I just want to succeed in it.

But how?? Is it even possible for me at this point? Should I fall back on music or art or one of my other hobbies? They all bring me joy, and my GPA brings me pain. Now it seems I am starting to associate physics in general with this pain. Is something wrong with me?"

Okay, sounds crazy to start of like this but let me finish the concept.

The universe is just what’s kept as a record of causality in order to break causality throughout infinities beyond that. I’ve drawn a basic picture in paint that describes this: http://imgur.com/FQqvAwr

Everything is just an infinite iterative process of e^i\*tau*n through more and more imaginary dimensions causing complexity to arise as the real counterpart to all the imaginary potential that breaks down into one well defined universe of the constantly reevaluating process of determining the exact values of e and tau through imaginary strings I don’t see any reason wouldn’t be capable of having infinite dimensions. 

Tracing it back through the inflation and down to the big bang would just be the negative/inverse process meaning the universe as a whole is just -e^i\*tau*n + e^i\*tau*n getting infinitesimally closer to zero from both ends (not ever actually reaching it though due to every finite iterations attempt to express transcendental numbers would give some margin of error).

But then again, this is just my intuitive thought about how things could be explained easily, to anyone, by someone who doesn’t really care more than trying to prove everyone and everything wrong so this is just my idea of how things could be explained and I'd appreciate to hear your thoughts on it.

I really enjoy posts like this because, even though programming skills are probably the most valuable skill for physicists today, I still kinda suck at this. It's really nice to see codes with helpful comments solving physics problems, because frankly most of my programming skills I learned from analyzing and re-writing code I found on the internet. And basically everytime someone posts their code on this sub, we get really cool, in-depth discussions about their approach, why something wasn't as good as it seemed and what kind of cool trick would be better (thinking about the [discussion that Runge-Kutta-4 is not symplectic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/5tf61n/nbody_orbit_simulation_with_rungekutta/) here).

The thing with code that is shared on this sub is that the underlying problem is often something I know from my studies, and this makes analyzing codes here much more interesting and relatable than codes that are posted on, for example, /r/python. Especially since there can be problems applying numerical methods to certain physical situations.

Question on PSI through a reduced pipeline,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1487818825,True,"Never took a physics class and only know some basic stuff. I work on an oil boat and have always been curious about pressure in this situation:

Say you have a pump pushing water out through a pipeline to another location 50 feet away. In the discharge side of this pump is an 8 inch pipe. There is a pressure gauge nearby on the 8 inch pipe that reads 50 PSI. This pipe continues down a bit and somewhere along the line is reduced from an 8 inch pipe to a 3 inch pipe or hose. Would the pressure on this smaller pipe/hose also be 50PSI, or would it be greater due to decreased surface area?

On one hand I feel like due it being Pounds per Square Inch, it wouldnt matter what place alone the line you gauged the pressure. On the other hand, I feel like it may increase in the smaller pipe due to larger sized force pushing into the reducer. I can not mentally figure this out lol.

How can photons have no mass and yet still have energy given that E=MC^2?,10,0,False,False,False,Physics,1487827530,True,"I did see some people answering that the formula E=MC^2 is used only for rest mass, and the actual formula is E^2= M^2 C^4 + P^2 C^2 which just equals to E=PC as we eliminate the first term M^2 C^2 because photon does not have any mass.

But the problem now is that E=PC doesn’t make sense either for that the momemtum P is calculated by P=MV, and mass here is also zero which makes the second term zero too.

How is this possible?"

Speed of light on and through hollow planet (thought experiment),15,0,False,False,False,Physics,1487882062,True,"First of all, this is a thought experiment regarding faster-than-light communication. 

Say you had an immense hollow planet that was made of some tough, heavy material, such as graphenated tungsten osmiumide (sorry, no wiki page... YET!)

Due to the mass of the planet, the speed of light on the surface is slowed down by several percent (compared to someone far far away from the planet). 

But the planet is hollow. Due to the gravitational force inside the planet being zero, the speed of light in the interior will be faster than that on the surface. 

If we were to ~~run a fiber-optic cable~~ use lasers and mirrors to bounce signals from the surface through the interior, would we be able to communicate faster than the speed of light, as far as the denizens on the surface were concerned? 

If yes, would this cause a paradox of any sort? "

Is gravity getting weaker through time?,8,0,False,False,False,Physics,1487906274,True,"I had the this thought the other day and it has been really bugging me ever since. There is very little online about this so can some please tell me why I'm wrong. I will explain my reasoning below.

1. Precursor - just to offer a reason why this argument shouldn't be rejected outright. Gravitational measurements are notoriously inconsistent so there is no empirical way to prove/ disprove this with current methods. Only two experiments using light from supernovae and pulsars are offered as evidence gravity doesn't change.  Hardly conclusive, especially considering the pulsar experiment said it could change by a trillionth over 26 years. Which could be substantial in deep time. Gravity doesn't fit into the standard model, could this be why?

2. Beginning of the universe - why does it expand? Why is expansion fundamental? As far back as we can go there was all matter and energy condensed and the 4 fundamental forces. If these are all constant and never changing why is the universe not static? Something must have changed in those original conditions to kick start things. Being the odd ball of forces, if any can change its gravity. The reduction in strength of gravity would cause expansion to happen.

3. Dark energy - First off, silly name. This can't be ""energy"" without breaking the first law of thermodynamics. Unlikely to be a ""fifth force"" also. Wouldn't expansion accelerate if gravity was losing her strength. It's also the only forces to have control over cosmological distances so why shouldn't it be related. Seems the simplest solution to me.

4. Dark matter - the further back in time we look the more of it we see. Although we don't ""see"" anything, only more gravity. Would it not be simpler if gravity was just stronger back in time. I know that gravity as it is now cannot account for why galaxies still hold together today. Couldn't this just be a lag in reduction. Ill use the analogy of spinning a wheel with your hand. Reducing the strength you assert each time you spin it. Then after several minutes of this someone measures the strength your arm uses. It's not enough to allow the wheel to be spinning as fast as it is. Why would you think there must be another hand instead of the simpler solution?

5. Time - why does it go forward? Entropy of course! Has anyone really found this a satisfactory answer ever? I understand what entropy is but why is it so connected to time. How does it have the power to tell time what way it must march? If gravity reduced over time then time would have to both exist and go in a uniformed direction. We already know time and gravity are strongly connected through gravitational time dilation. This has been proven by experiment. What experiment shows such a strong link between time and entropy? To hand gravity the reigns over time it must be accepted that it changes in a uniformed way. We know gravity can control times speed so surely it would make sense that it also controls the direction. 

Thank you for reading and I look forward to any replies. I have no maths to back this up and humbly assume I'm wrong. Nonetheless, I think it's an interesting idea and hope you do too."

Supermassive Black Holes ... duh?,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1488056425,True,"I'm watching a documentary on supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies and they are arguing that the realization that the center of galaxies having black holes was a surprise and that it was even more astonishing to realize that there is a link between its size and the galaxy suggesting that they are central to the creation of the galaxy itself. Duh? 

Help me understand the mentality of the time. Once galaxies were known to exist, what on earth did scientist believe was at the center of the galaxy? Planets have stars, moons have planets, electrons have nuclei. Each center has a relationship between its mass and the mass of its satellites. Why wouldn't the galaxy? 

Also, if they simply thought it was a swirling mass of stars, did they not think that the center would have one supermassive enormous stars? Why wasn't the absence of these super massive bright stars itself proof that black holes exist? I get that people didn't think black holes were possible, but come on. What else could it be after no stars that bright were discovered in known galaxies? 

Arguing that it was just a lot of stars swirling around themselves seems silly on its face. Water circling down a drain will eventually go down the drain. All these swirling stars would have to collide at some point - a chain reaction after the first collision. If they didn't make a black hole, then it would still need to be a super massive amount of mass that is highly dense at the center of the galaxy. 

And of course they have a relationship to the total size of the things that orbit it. What in the universe doesn't? The Earth doesn't and can't have the number and size of moons that Jupiter has. Venus not having a moon today is likely due to it's moon having collided with Venus at some point in its past (this is definitionally true if we define the point of the event as potentially occurring during the planet's formation stage), but there is clearly a limit to the amount of stuff that can orbit a planet. Also ... let's not all be surprised when we find lonely supermassive black holes with no galaxy around them. Galaxies collide and things are sent flying. If planets and stars can be flung out to empty space, so can supermassive black holes. If a star can be flung out without its planets, so can a black hole. 

I don't know. I know that all great realizations seem obvious after they are discovered, but this still feels strange to me. If not a supermassive black hole then what?

Dumb question about calculating centre of mass and escape velocity,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1488070765,True,"I'm a 17 year old guy who just really likes calculating stuff for fun, just different new things to make me learn more about physics. But because I haven't really studied physics a whole lot yet so this will probably come of as an easy-peasy question, but nevertheless. I was trying to calculate the escape velocity of an apple with a mass of about 0.11 kilograms, in a theoretical scenario where the apple is basically catapulted from the surface of the earth right into the air. So I googled it and found [this explanation and formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity), I recognized everything about the equation except for *r* , which basically stands for the centre of mass between the body that is about to escape and the body which it's trying to escape from (I think? the wording confused me a bit). So then a few questions arose. How do measure the distance between the earth and the apple? Where do you start counting? If you just measure the distance between the objects it would become 0, right? But to they instead mean from the centre of gravity of both objects? Meaning that I'll basically have to use the earth's radius as the distance between them? And then is the earth's centre of gravity counted as the starting point then?

Would really appreciate a response. Sincerely, an aspiring physics enthusiast."

Importance of a physics Phd for a career in biophysics (academic or otherwise)?,8,18,False,False,False,Physics,1488079457,True,"I have a pretty hefty decision to make, I am planning on starting my phd with a focus in biophysics in September, and so far have received two good admissions offers, but from very different programs. 

One is from a traditional top 30 physics program which has a few faculty carrying out really interesting research at the intersection of condensed matter and biophysics, the field I am most interested in. 

The other offer is from a top 10 physics school, but for an interdisciplinary biomolecular engineering program in which I would have the flexibility to take whatever courses I want from any department that would be relevant to my research, and work with any professor from any relevant department (including physics). This school also has several faculty carrying out the type of biophysics research I am interested in.  

The second offer is very enticing due to the flexibility it offers as well as the stellar reputation of the school in the physics community. However, I am concerned that I would be missing out on most of the grad level physics courses that everyone with a physics phd takes at some point, and I would also graduate with a degree that says ""Phd in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with emphasis in Biophysics and Bioengineering"" rather than just a Phd in physics. 

I am curious to know how this different degree might affect my future academic or industry job search if I am interested in pursuing a research career in biophysics. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

TLDR: Trying to decide between a top 30 physics program, and a top 10 ""Biomolecular Engineering"" program where I could still work with a physics professor. How might the different degree and different coursework affect future job searches in biophysics?"
Apparent weight in an elevator.,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1488087163,True,"If you are in an elevator moving at constant velocity 1m/s upward, vs an elevator moving 100m/s upward will your weight on a scale be the same? I don't think so. My reasoning is wattage. Going up at 1m/s requires less wattage them going up at 100m/s. That is the reason a crane lifts a light weight quickly, but will raise a heavy load very slowly. That is also the reason why your car works harder to go up the same hill quickly rather than slowly. I am hearing a lot of people say that since it is constant velocity, the apparent weight will be the same, since you are not accelerating. I get that, but then explain why one requires more force than the other. "

Therefore I thought I should ask, what does Gravity tell us about celestial bodies and the way that Gravity affects them? I would like some enlightenment please, because I believe that this is the only evidence that Flat Earthers cannot deny. (If they do they have to prove it wrong somehow and that's impossible). Any other form of evidence they have found (ridiculous;) ways to tackle them. But they simple can't go against Newton and Einstein.


Therefore how can we show that Gravity would shape any flat shaped Earth inevitably into a sphere by crushing it into its own weight? What can I use as sufficient evidence to prove that Gravity acts this way?

I'm thinking about the exterior covariant derivative as the exterior derivative acting on the horizontal part of a vector, and the curvature as the exterior covariant derivative of the connection form. Going off [these](https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk/Activities/GT/Lect2.pdf) notes, I'm confused about the following:

In section 2.1.2, proposition 2.1 states that the curvature form (exterior covariant derivative of the connection) has the expression with a 1/2 in front of the commutator term. But in section 2.2.2, exercise 2.5 gives an expression for the exterior covariant derivative of V-valued k-forms. Specializing to the case where V is the Lie algebra of G, it seems like I would recover proposition 2.1 but without the factor of 1/2, since the action of the Lie algebra on V (also the Lie algebra in this case) is the commutator.

Question about Newton's Third Law and Lift,15,0,False,False,False,Physics,1488167953,True,"Hello. Studying the Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, I came across a part that I really can't wrap my head around. So I'm here to ask for your help with that.

""As the air stream strikes the relatively flat lower surface of a wing or rotor blade when inclined at a small angle to its direction of motion, the air is forced to rebound downward, causing an upward reaction in positive lift. At the same time the air stream striking the upper curved section of the leading edge is deflected upward. An airfoil is shaped to cause an action on the air, and forces air downward, which provides an equal reaction from the air, forcing the airfoil upward(3-8).""

Here, it's easy to understand how the airflow below the airfoil generates upward force by the law of action-reaction. My question is about the second part. How the airflow above the airfoil ""forces the airfoil upward"" by ""forcing air downward""? It just doesn't make sense to me. If the air stream above the airfoil forces air downward, it should be the air above the airfoil that springs back upward, not the airfoil below it. How on earth could the air above the airfoil reacting to the downward force force the airfoil upward?? Anybody who can enlighten me on this?"

Since all matter came from a singularity (Big Bang theory), time is just a chain of events happening after the Big Bang theory. If we had a way to ""move"" all matter back to the position it was in when a certain event happened, then essentially we would be in that time period. Setting aside the time travel paradox of if you change the past would the initial decision to change it happen in the first place, I could arrange all the matter to the state it was in 10 years ago.

"If you were able to slow time around you (movie-style), wouldn't everything start to look weird?",4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1488215493,True,"This is honestly a shower thought, but I wanted to talk about the actual science behind it. Take your typical movie scenario, where a person is able to slow time around them, or accelerate themselves so that time around them seems slower.

Assuming that none of the other horrible things that would come with moving at speeds *way* faster than everything around you would obliterate you, the area around you, or the whole universe, I have a question:

If someone slowed time around them, would their perception of colours not be shifted? For example, violet is ~700THz, but with a 25% reduction in everything around them, including light, would they see it as ~525THz, closer to yellow-green? Then ultra-violet and bands shorter than that would populate the visible spectrum?

I ask this because in every movie ever that I can think of, the person who is accelerated doesn't seem to lose their ability to see everything normally."

speed vs time dilation vs dimension contraction : question (where am I wrong ?),5,1,False,False,False,Physics,1488221928,True,"Hi Reddit,

First, I'm not a expert in Physics, I am just interested in the subject. I got this question twisting my mind for some time now, and if someone around here could help me getting through it, that would be amazing.

Fisrt I need to established the ""base"" of my thinking:
speed of light is always constant in any reference frame. I assume this means a photon will always ""get away"" from you at 300000km/sec. Lets call this ""rule #1"".

Here is my fictionnal situation: I'm in a spaceship going at 150000km/sec (compared to earth position). My ship has a light in front that emits photons. At first sight, these photons could appear as if they are ""getting away"" at 150000km/sec from the ship, but my time as slowed down by half, so photons are still getting away at 300000km/sec (rule #1). To me this should have been demonstrating that my time is ""twice"" as long as earth time (because of course, the photon are not going at 150000 + 300000 km/sec).

But all this is wrong apparently, because time dilation for this particular situation (150000km/sec) I is only about 15% longer...not 2 times (from internet calculator I found)

Then I heard about Lorrentz and his dimensionnal contraction as the speed goes up. So I thought that, being ""shorter"" could help explaning time dilation, as being shorter, the photons pass you ""faster"" (or take less time to pass you). But this contraction factor at 300000km/sec is only about 15%. So ""my math"" does work at all.

How can you go at 150000km/sec, and not having your time slowed down in half, when you must see a photon getting away at 300000km/sec ?

I don't need an ELI5, but of course ""explain like i'm Einstein"" it not what I expect.

Where am I wrong ?

thanks in advance for your time

How is it possible to have, say, a frequency of 50 Hz and a pulse width of 300 milliseconds? This is one of the standard protocols for the use of a TENS unit. I thought that frequency and wavelength had to be reciprocals of each other, and that pulse width was more or less analogous to wavelength.

Is it possible that there is a Black-hole inside of a neutron-star ?,23,7,False,False,False,Physics,1488368653,True,"First of all, sorry for my bad english. Now to my question :

To my understanding :

1. every object can become a black-hole if you compress it enough ( below the Schwarzschild-radius).

2.  only a black hole with a certain mass and above can sustain itself without evaporating instantly.

3. if i take a big object , like for example the earth, and measure the density of it, i´ll find out that its elements are alot more condensed in its core than on the surface.

4. if we add enough mass to a neutron star, it will become a black-hole.


Let´s assume that we have a neutron star that is close to the critical mass needed to become a black hole. For us to perceive that it has become a black hole, the neutron-star has to be smaller than its Schwarzschild radius. So my conclusion here would be that :
more mass -> more compression -> the star can become smaller than its Schwarzschildradius and therefore become a black hole.

Now if we look at point 3 from above we know that the elements inside the neutron-stars core are more compressed than the ones on its surface. So thats why im asking myself and you fellow redditors, 
if its possible that the neutronstar elements in the core have become smaller than its (the cores) Schwarzschildradius and thus became a black hole that we can not perceive since the neutron stars surface elements (all elements from the core onwards to the surface) are bigger than the whole neutronstars schwarzschildradius ? 

Sorry for the complicated formulation, i hope you understood what im trying to ask.

There have been a lot of responses to this, but I'm curious how this is being treated by the professionals.  Just last week, an interview with Dr. Emil Mottola of Los Alamos National Laboratory came out with a bit of a layman's tone.  Dr. Mottola has been writing papers on alternative black-hole objects called Gravastars since 2001.

Does anyone have some insight on what other things gravitational wave astronomy might be able to tell us on determining the difference between classical black holes and alternatives that propose a surface?

Chaos Theory - Need help with my script,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1488457103,True,"So i'm writing a script for a Youtube show i'm making, and it's pretty heavy on the science/physics side in terms of exposition. 

So before i jump into what i want to ask let me just briefly explain the story. 

A Time traveler and his time traveling machine go back 30 years in time. On the way, the machine breaks up, part of it landing in a facility, the other crashing into the ocean. The time traveler survives blah blah blah. 

Now part of the machine ends up in a corporate RnD facility, and so a bunch of scientists begin researching it, they find out it's part of a time traveling machine, and so they have a discussion about the implication of time travel and chaos theory amongst their colleagues. Now the discussion goes a bit like this. The scientist begins by stating a simple example : 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ""Joe Blow enjoys a chicken sandwich at this Time(T)=0, in the specific, macro quantum state Ψjoe1 Any event happening anywhere within the causal, and non-causal universe at T=0 can not effect the quantum state of Ψjoe1 in any way without FTL travel."" 

He continues on by saying that as Time (T) goes into negative values, the probability that Joe blow will eat a Ham sandwich(Ψjoe2) instead of a chicken sandwich(Ψjoe1) will increase, and that any event within the causal universe can act as the cause for this change in event. The value increases exponentially, and is inversely proportional to the distance of the cause, and of Ψjoe1 (basically like a field emanating from Joe, except that field is a field of probability that joe would eat a Ham sandwich, which increases as T goes further into negative value.) 

He summarizes by saying that by the 1950's, the chance that Joe Blow would have had Ham instead of chicken would be .0000001%(arbitrarily low number), the same probability that he would eat a stick of dynamite. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
So ya if someone could help me out in articulating my idea a bit better, because i believe that i could better arrive at the final joke (i know it's a lame joke but i think it's funny), and if anyone could provide an equation that is actually real instead of the made-up ones i provided that would be great. thanks in advance."

So in other words, is it possible that there is some property (of Earth and the space in its vicinity) by virtue of which it behaves as if it has less inertial mass, the same we that a rotating reference frame has the property that it is non-inertial, which makes it behave differently to an inertial frame."

Can the magnus effect work on an air body?,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1488516178,True,"I'm a high school student and I was having trouble understanding something (I'm going to speak only about the southern hemisphere because it's easier to explain in one hemisphere):

At around 25°S to 5°S is a belt of very warm water (in southern hemisphere summer). This water gets heated up to around 26,5°C. Once it does, the air becomes very moist, and as a result, pressure may drop in certain spots. If it does, air blows in towards those spots because of pressure gradient force. When it does it brings even more moisture into that low pressure cell therefore dropping the pressure even more. This keeps happening and so the pressure keeps dropping and dropping. More and more air is rising at the centre (where the pressure is lowest) and so we now have the start of a tropical cyclone/hurricane/typhoon. As that air moves in towards the centre, it is deflected by coriolis force. In the southern hemisphere that deflection is clockwise for converging air.

From 30°S to 0° is the south easterly wind belt (blows towards the north west). This is here due to the high pressure at 30°S blowing air to the lower pressure of the equator, and being deflected to the left (ie towards the north west in the southern hemisphere). 

It would therefore stands to reason that the path of a cyclone follows the windbelt at which it formed. Cyclones move from east to west because of this windbelt as would be expected, however it does not move north for some reason. When it hits land, it moves south, not North. Until eventually it gets caught in the Westerly windbelt. 

I didn't and still probably don't understand this southern movement of cyclones when they hit land but I have a theory and I would like to know if this theory is possible (or if anyone knows the answer to my question that would also be great!)

Is it possible that - since the trade winds weaken at the land, but coriolis force, and therefore the spinning motion of the cyclone, doesn't - the cyclone is no longer being pulled as hard in a northerly direction and therefore the Magnus effect becomes the prevailing force?

I like to imagine it like a giant soccer ball. If I were a giant and kicked that soccer ball from east to west just below the equator in a straight line, but give it a left spin, it would curve left from the Magnus effect. A tropical cyclone does exactly this.

Is it possible that the Magnus effect is responsible?"

I have been tasked with leading some tutorial type sessions this semester for an introductory physics class, with basically any teaching style I wish. Since the students already have lectures and group-work style classes, I'm thinking of making my sessions more about general discussions and relating what they're learning to some interesting or novel applications. 

Semester only started this week, and I don't want to assume any knowledge beyond what they have been taught so far (even if most know more from high school). By the time I take my first session the students would have covered:

 - Lecture 2: Displacement and Distance, Velocity and speed (both average and instantaneous)

 - Lecture 3: Acceleration (average and instantaneous) and Kinematic equations

 - Lecture 4: Vectors introduction, polar and component forms of vectors

 - Lecture 5: Vector addition and position vectors

 - Lecture 6: Vector multiplication (dot and cross products), vector differentiation

 - Lecture 7: Vector representation of kinematic quantities and kinematic equations in 2 and 3 dimensions, Projectile Motion

I have some ideas for how to explain the dot and cross product conceptually, and I also want to describe how integrals can be thought of as infinite sums. But I have 50 minutes to fill, and although I'm *hoping* that the students will ask questions, I want to be prepared either way.

What are some (mathematically) simple/basic ideas that students have trouble understanding conceptually, which I could try to reframe for them? 

What are some interesting ways that we could apply the ideas they have learnt? For example, I was thinking of applying concepts of force onto something like SpaceX's rocket landings (when they get to that topic). 

Would it be appropriate to discuss interesting physics stuff at the start of each session for a few minutes, even if it's technically outside the scope of the class? The stuff they're learning is both basic and dry, and it might be a good idea to remind them of what they could be working towards. An example would be the recent discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system.

Question About Physics Lab,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1488650646,True,"Just wanna run a quick question by the community too see if this makes sense at all.

My train of thought is that at a more shallow angle of inclination, the car will have a higher average velocity because of a lesser opposing weight force. Given a higher velocity, by using 1/2mv^2, I can calculate the kinetic energy, or the output energy of the motor. Therefore, at steeper angles, motor will have a lower efficiency.

[Question] Fermionic Coherent States,3,8,False,False,False,Physics,1488766511,True,"I have a few questions about fermionic coherent states and their relation to Grassmann numbers that I can't seem to fully work out. I understand that *something* has to be different to create a fermionic coherent state since the annihilation operators anti commute but I am having trouble reconciling the introduction of Grassmann numbers with the fundamental concept of a Hilbert space. 

For starters, where do the coherent states actually ""live""? They cannot be within the normal fermionic Fock space since they involve coefficients which are Grassmann numbers and the Fock space, strictly speaking, is a vector space over C. 

Secondly, lets say we *do* generalize the Fock space to allow Grassmannian coefficients. How can we insist that the annihilation operators anti-commute with the Grassmannian numbers? After all, the fermion operators are just matrices and can be represented by a complex matrix, so why should a Grassmann number not commute with it?

[question] What is a physical dimention of space?

There is also one more rule to this, the dimensions' values should be uncorrelated, otherwise you should change base.

(standard definition of dimension is here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension)

Here comes the question:
Could we define dimension this way? 
If we did, then all uncorrelated properties of space would be dimensions and so we would have: x,y,z,t,m (magnetism) as dimensions while g (gravity) would not qualify.

So can we treat magnetism as another dimension of space?"

Where is the best spot to strike the cue ball to make it stop moving when it comes into contact with a billiards ball?,3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1488847720,True,"My roommate and I are having an argument.
He says that to make a cue ball stop dead when it hits another ball, you have to hit it dead centre. His argument is that all of the momentum is transferred to the other ball.
I've watched several videos on the ""stop shot"" and I'm trying to convince him that hitting the cue ball lower to make it ""skid"" as it hits the ball is the best method for a stop shot. I'll admit his argument is convincing, although I know very little about the physics of free body diagrams.
Who is right? My opinion is that we should just use the ""skid"" method because all other pool players seem to use it and it accounts for non ideal conditions rather than relying on the perfect hit.

I responded with the fact that wind has an affect on the copter. We aren't actually staying ""still"" and from our perspective it may look still. But the wind is pushing us uniformly with the earth. That's why we would land on the same spot.

Major in Engineering or Physics?,18,0,False,False,False,Physics,1488881906,True,"I am not sure what to major in. I have always been interested in space and learning about the physical (and theoretical) properties of it. In high school however I started getting more interested in particle physics for some reason.

Now I have to apply for university and I am not sure what I should pick. Engineering physics/Aerospace engineering or Physics/Astronomy? Problem with engineering here is that it takes 24 hours by train to get there and it is risky if I lose interest.

I am more inclined towards general physics because it is a wide field and as I said, I have a strong interest in different parts of physics and not solely astronomy.

But there is also engineering physics which is basically a less theoretical and more applied form of physics, which also sound interesting. Not sure if it would be right for me. Can be nice to have a practical application of knowledge, and a lot of job opportunities?

So what should I do? I am doubtful if physics is right for me because people keep complaining about not getting a job **related to the field.**

Does anyone here do gamma ray coincidence spectroscopy?,7,2,False,False,False,Physics,1488886841,True,"For my Master's project, I am reconstructing energy level schemes of nuclei to determine their excited states.  I'm using RADWARE to do this, if anyone is familiar with this software.  This is not something I have ever done before now.  My experimental set-up and method goes something like this:

* Two germanium detectors, set opposite each other, with a radioactive source in the middle (e.g. Eu-152).  

* The two detectors record data of what gamma ray events they see.  This is stored in a matrix i.e. an energy vs energy graph, showing all the energies on y that any given energy on x sees.  The matrix is symmetric about some line from the origin since both detectors should see the same gamma spectrum.  Coming out of the plane is the counts, if you like.  

* Selecting an energy interval on x lets you look at all the energies on y that that interval sees.  

My supervisor has told me a bit about how to reconstruct the level schemes:

* A gamma ray will ""see"" all the other gamma rays which occur in the same cascade.  

* More intense peaks fall nearer the bottom of the cascade - he likened this to tributaries of a river converging towards the estuary.  

* If a gamma ray sees another gamma ray that one above it doesn't see, this can feed in from another band, where the cascade branches out (because of nucleons pairings breaking their spins or moving orbitals or something).  

I think I'm starting to get it but conceptually I'm still struggling.  Why, for example, does two gamma rays being in coincidence with each other imply that they should be part of the same cascade?  Does anyone do this sort of thing for research?  "

Experiment for calculating distance by using waves and atomic clocks,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1488989748,True,"Hi eveyone, I am high school student who is currently enrolled in IB Programme. I want to write a lab report to show that atomic clocks and waves can be used to calculate a distance between two objects with synchronized atomic clocks. Is there any experiment ,whose data I can access, done for using atomic clocks for calculating the distance. I know that GPS is based on this technology. Is there any public experiment?

This is will be (maybe) my hpyothesis: suppose we have two points (a and b) and we want to know the distance between them. I will calculate the exact time from a and send it to point b. At the time of receiving I will calculate the time at point b. If I know the average speed of the wave which I have used for sending the information from point a to point b,I can calculate the distance with a basic formula. Which was the main idea that shaped the technology we call GPS."

"Help, I'm a physics postdoc and I hate my job",8,5,False,False,False,Physics,1489035557,True,"I love physics. I love learning about physics. I love talking about physics. I love being a part of the physics community. But I think I finally have to admit to myself that I hate the day-to-day work of doing physics research.

If you were to ask me, ""What's the worst possible job for you? What job would you find the least enjoyable and is the worst suited to your skills and work style?"" I would say, ""Anything that has me sitting at a desk in front of a computer by myself all day."" Now obviously I can sit down and knock out some writing, coding, or whatever on a computer when I need to. I got all the way through a PhD. But having it be the only thing I do all day every day is absolutely miserable for me.

When I finished my undergrad, I got a job as an astronomy research assistant. I quickly discovered that my entire job was sitting at a computer all day staring at globular cluster images and IDL code. So I decided I hated observational astronomy research and quit to start grad school. Many years passed and I finished my coursework and got deep into my dissertation research. (My focus shifted to experimental particle physics.) I got deep into doing the analysis and writing for my dissertation and found myself sitting at my desk in front of my computer all day. I pushed through because getting my physics PhD was a major lifetime goal and the end was in sight. When I applied for my postdoc, I specifically looked for ones where I could be at the lab everyday working with the hardware. 

Well, I got a postdoc based at a major national lab, basically my dream job. I'm technically working with hardware... writing the interface software for the prototype electronics. I drive to the lab every morning, sit at my desk in front of my computer all day, and drive home in the evening. I get very little done each day because I hate it so much (as was the case with the previous research job), and then I feel awful because I wasted most of the day. But that just means I have to spend the next day at my desk staring at my computer.

I'm not sure what exactly I expected research to be like, but I certainly expected it to be more active and interactive. I guess I expected to be actually physically working with the hardware more, and directly working with other physicists more. Instead I pretty much only talk to my collaborators via email and weekly Skype calls. I know a lot of aspects of physics research involve some heavy computer work: DAQ, Monte Carlo, analysis, write-up, etc. But I'm starting to feel like that's all I will ever do. If I stay in research, am I doomed to months of working behind a desk every day interspersed with brief moments of lab work, or is there some type of work I can move into where I spend at least some fraction of my day in the lab (or at least on my feet, working with my hands, or interacting with others) every day? Again, my PhD is in nuclear/particle physics experiment.

I'm considering leaving physics research for some other type of work, but I don't really know where to look. I've already done so much school (and spent so long being a poor grad student) that I really don't want to do more classes or training. I know most of the private sector jobs hiring physics PhDs are data analyst positions and similar (no good, same problem). I've thought about looking into engineering positions, but I don't know what sorts of engineering positions I'd be qualified for, and I'm afraid I'd just end up in front of a computer all day working in CAD or something.

I've considered going into industry in either medical physics or the energy industry, but there's a lot I still don't know about those fields. What sort of experience would I need to gain to get qualified for one of those jobs (and how long would it take)? What is the day-to-day like for those positions?

I did some teaching as a grad student, and I liked it. I think I would really enjoy teaching, but most positions require some postdoc experience, which means sticking with my current job for at least three more years or so. Also, I've heard horror stories about how competitive faculty positions are, and the intense ""publish or perish"" environment, especially during the first few years.

Overall I'm wondering if I made a huge mistake pursuing a physics career. I don't regret all I've learned in the last several years. But maybe the actual work of being a physicist isn't a good fit for me. Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been struggling with this for the last few months and I had to get it all out.

TL;DR: I love physics. I hate sitting at a desk all day. Turns out physics research involves a lot of sitting at a desk. I'm trying to figure out what to do with myself now."

I do not understand forward bias in P-N junctions,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1489173112,True,"Hi guys.

I apologize in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. 

I was reading about PN junctions a while ago.
So,when a PN junction is subjected to forward bias, the positive side of the battery is connected to the 'P' part of the junction, and the negative side to the 'N' part.

My book claims that in forward bias, the depletion layer gets thinner. My reasoning for that is that because the potential difference across the battery pushes the 'holes' to the 'N' side and the electrons to the 'P' side, leading to the combination of hole-electron pairs at the depletion layer, thus making it thinner.

Is my reasoning correct?

Then, my book claims that a current now flows through the junction. I do not understand how. For if the electrons were to pass through the junction, they would have to be absorbed by the holes, i.e, they cannot pass through the depletion layer without combining with the holes.

So, current shouldn't flow at all until the depletion layer vanishes, right?

Thank you. :) "

Do waves travel backwards or not?,11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1489177390,True,"Hi everyone, I'm sorry if this question is too random. It's mostly out of curiosity, but it's driving me insane.

It's just that, as I was studying Waves, specifically Huygens Principle, I found it odd that the backward waves were ignored. I have done extensive research on the internet about that and have found numerous equations, which I'll never be able to understand, so I was hoping that someone could give me a more intuitive answer.

Does the wave actually go backward? Is it destructively interfered in the backward direction? How so? Or is it because of this ""obliquity factor"" which, I guess, relates to Kirchoff Diffraction Formula or this Green Theorems, which I also have no idea what it is? By the way, isn't this obliquity factor too arbitrary?

Car weight transfer (Up hill and during acceleration),2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1489186005,True,"My friend and I have this argument going on and basically it's what would be better uphill in snow or rain, RWD or FWD.  I say a modern RWD is better in rain and probably equal or slightly better in snow (all arguments are about up hill).  He says the opposite.
It would be awesome if someone who is an expert at this sort of thing can answer as simply as possible.. I'll give a few assumptions to work with..

Both cars are 3500 lbs 
RWD: 50/50 weight distribution
FWD: 60/40 weight distribution

I'm not sure about a FWD but probably similar or a tad higher ?  Let's go with a Maxima for the sake of comparison if anyone knows.. same tires on both 

We can assume light to medium acceleration as well.
The format of the answer I'm looking for can go kind of like this :

Light acceleration 
Hill grade (choose a likely steepish hill you'd encounter in the burbs or city )

RWD 
Rear axle load (lbs) 
Front axle load (lbs)
Max theoretical hill climb angle 

FWD
Rear axle load (lbs)

Maybe a point (grade) where the RWD would have equal weight on the drive axle as the FWD ? Unaccelerated and accelerated?


On level ground a good balanced Rwd would have 1750 lbs on both axles..

On level ground a typically balanced FWD would have 2100/1400 lb balance 

Also how would this change during acceleration in the rain for example (max typical all season tire traction in rain )


I hope this would be a fun problem for someone to work out and I would greatly enjoy seeing the results

Thanks in advance for your time !

What are some alternative options?
Feels like my science career is broken before it's even started,4,10,False,False,False,Physics,1489226864,True,"So i've been studying as an undergrad for the 4th year now as a maths/physics teacher. I have 1 year left and then one more whole year as a trainee at a highschool (so basically 2 years left lol). This might be odd for you but this is a renewed system after throwing the bolognese one out of the window which was really crap for the teachers training. The new system is 5+1 years long (unless you choose to be a teacher in elementary school then it is 4+1). Just a brief insight of what the system is in case you wondered but this is not what i want to talk about.
Being into uni at first is was all party drugs n rock n roll yo' know. I mean i passed all my exams with OK grades. But i never managed to understand deeply the basic concepts. As i digged deep into uni i started to take more advanced courses (qmechanics, relativity, advanced calculus, etc.) and most of which REALLY fascinated me, i can't emphasise that enough how thrilled i am by now.

On the other side of the coin things started to really hit me back in the face. Basically EVERYTHING i skipped learning or did not manage to understand by any means is now knocking at my doors. I have some really good teachers now wanting to really teach something not just blabla the whole semester. I dont want to blame anyone since it was probably just me being stupid or not even stupid but it took me a good 3 years to learn how to study physics/maths.

But now i feel so emberassed. I was wondering if i could do a phd (which i have no doubts in that i could) since i have so much catch up to do i dont even know where shoud i start.

One more to this i was really looking for someone to study with but here everyone is to introvert or doesnt even care whether he/she can understand anything or no that i have never managed to get working a study group. Im sure this wouldve really helped me in the first place.

I've been trying to learn from educational sites, channels and then i got an idea: maybe i should do my own channel mainly because it would FORCE me to learn and understand stuff since i found out that i can understand everything deeply if i study it when i know im gonna have to teach it to someone. I even started to realize things WHILE teaching it which might sound stupid but thats what really happens.

Wow this turned out to be a wall of text and not a really structured one, probably showing how confused am i now.

TLDR; Not knowing what to do after slacking in the first years of uni after realizing i am really into science."

holonomic constraint brain teaser,2,6,False,False,False,Physics,1489256807,True,"This is something I've been thinking about recently. Weigh in if you have an idea. 

    Given N particles with position vectors 

    r1, r2,...,rN

    what is the minimum number of constraints required to cause the system to act like a rigid body?

Allowed constraints are:

    bondlength: g(r1,r2)=0 // fix |r2-r1|
    
    planar angle: f(r1,r2,r3)=0 // fix arccos((r2-r1).(r3-r2)/(|r2-r1||r3-r2|))
    
    dihedral angle: h(r1,r2,r3,r4)=0 // fix dihedral angle (there is a formula somewhere for this, requires 4 position vectors)

Consider the base case of benzene, C6 (ignore the hydrogens). Fixing all bondlengths and angles should work. Are all 12 constraints necessary? Can you use fewer?

Note that although the question brings to mind molecules, no notion of a chemical bond is inherent: you can constrain any set of 2,3, or 4 particles e.g. setting the ""bondlength"" of carbons 1,4 in benzene fixes the diameter of the C6 molecule. "

See Into The World of Physics 114 Years Ago,50,257,False,False,False,Physics,1489345485,True,"Recently, I dug up an old book I was given by my mother about a year ago. *Lessons in Physics* by Lothrop D Higgins. I know this book has been republished into new versions, but I have an original first edition (Which itself isn't particularly rare either, but it's still interesting).

It's really beat up, but hey, it's over 100 years old. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/LEmSg) I've included pictures of the table of contents of the book. If you see a subject you like, comment what you want to see and why you want to see it, and I will take pictures of the contents of that section and offer some of the most interesting information about it! 

I've read this book through a couple times now, and it's fascinating how much information is presented which we now know is to be incomplete or incorrect. So come with me on a little peep into the world of physics a century ago! 

I'll be adding some notable sections as people ask for them!

1. [The Ether](http://imgur.com/a/HA6yd) - In 1903, scientists had no way to understand how light traveled in space. To their understanding, energy needed a medium to propagate through, as sound waves need air or water. To explain the phenomena, they hypothesized The Ether, an invisible medium in space through which light could travel. 

2. [Some Noted Scientists](http://imgur.com/a/CLyE4) - This section is fascinating. There are many famous scientists which are no longer with us today, but at the time of this publication were alive and well. To see their names followed by a birth year and a blank space puts into perspective how this book was at one time sharing the earth with them. Several other scientists had yet to be thrust into the public eye, and as such are missing from this section. These include Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr, and Erwin Schrödinger. 

3. [Explosions](http://imgur.com/a/uTMzN) - I'm no chemist, so with this section, I'll defer to someone else who may know more about the accuracy of the information here. Still really cool though. 

4. [Liquefied Air](http://imgur.com/a/NdGDF) - A section detailing the cooling of normal air, and the use of air itself as the cooling agent. 

5. [Light](http://imgur.com/a/jY8ba) - One of my favorite sections. It's amazing to see that in 1903, relatively little was known about light, such as how it traveled, and what it was in general. "
Rate of C14 decay in a very fast moving frame of reference,5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1489346661,True,"Let's say I put some C14 in a space ship that moves at 99.9996% c. Then observe it from outside. Now, since time is moving slowly inside the moving frame of reference - C14 will decay slower. 

But decay rate of C14 is governed by some basic laws like the weak/strong force in the nucleus. And time is moving normally for me. So what I see is that the same C14 atom takes longer to disintegrate in the moving frame of reference. Does that mean that some laws of physics have changed inside the moving frame of reference ?

What am I doing wrong here ?

EDIT: oh wait, i think i may have an explanation. But would be nice if someone can confirm. The size of the nucleus will change when looking from outside - so, the forces that keeps the particles together will have an easier job of keeping them together - causing the decay to take longer. Is that right ?"

"Advice to high school/ early undergrad physics students: make your main focus math, not physics",114,551,False,False,False,Physics,1489432619,True,"*Disclaimer: I'm a college sophomore, so take my advice with a grain of salt, and please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, this relates to introductory physics courses (I think these might be called university physics?)*


Before you start building a house, you first get the tools you need. The tools are maths: calculus (including vector calc, differential eqs), linear algebra, etc. The house will be built in phases, so once you have the tools necessary for the first phase, you can begin construction (while getting any additional tools needed for the next phase).


Enough with the analogy, but I'm trying to say that the maths you will learn in your early college (and maybe high school) days will be essential to studying physics, more essential than introductory physics courses. For example, I was in undergrad E&M last week where the professor spent the lecture finding curl and div. of a magnetic field. For that lecture, any previous knowledge of magnetism was pretty irrelevant, although knowledge of vector calc was necessary. Another example is that you'll solve ""circular motion"" type problems in Classical Mech. using only **F**=m**a** in cylindrical coordinates (no centripetal acc. formula!)


So practice calc until you can solve (reasonable) integrals and diff eq.s in your sleep. When these concepts are inevitably used in your later courses, you can try to understand the physics, instead of having to learn the maths from the ground up (although at that point, most of the math knowledge will be gone from your short term memory, but that's ok! at least you have prior exposure). 

I'm not saying to ignore introductory physics. Try your best in class, don't skip lecture, get help if you need it, etc. However, if you find yourself not intuitively understanding everything, it's ok. If you find you have to budget time between maths and physics, my advice is to focus more on understanding the former. At this point in your physics career, you'll have to rely on the formulas sometimes without knowing exactly how to derive them. You need the tools first. 


edit: In your free time read/watch popular physics if you want! It can help keep your interest in physics alive. Just know that what's being conveyed might be a simplified version of physics, possibly incorrect."

Undergraduate in Physics - Anyone else feel extremely stressed?,9,11,False,False,False,Physics,1489467161,True,"Hey all,

So I'm in the second half of my 3rd (our of 4) years in Physics. Courses I've taken include all the calculus series, linear algebra, and currently in vector calculus. Taken basic physics 1 and 2, modern physics, and thermodynamics. Currently enrolled in advanced mechanics, optics, and a computational physics course that goes over some applications of different mathematical methods (the book for this course is, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences by Boa).


Point is, I have absolutely almost zero downtime. I don't have time to do much anymore (which is fine, and kind of what I expected). What worries me though, is I feel like I just can't learn all the material I'm supposed to learn. I feel like I learn a lot of things and then a semester later they're gone from memory. For example, I don't remember most of thermodynamics honestly, and even recalling to previous calculus courses is hard sometimes.


The point of this post is the following, I suppose:

1.) Is this normal? Are other undergraduates out there struggling this hard and constantly studying/prepping for tests? My friends never see me anymore and always complain about how I'm locked up in my room studying 24/7.


2.) Anyone else struggling to learn everything they need to learn? I constantly feel like I'm behind trying to catch up, and most of the time I'm in lecture and find it difficult to keep up with the material that's presented to me.


3.) Will graduate school, if I choose to pursue it, be this stressful as well? I figured it'd be even worse and honestly that worries me.



I just need more time in my day to read all the material I need to read, and digest the mathematics and concepts that I'm expected to learn. I'm only at 14 credits as well (12 is considered full time, 18 considered a ""full load""), to put that in perspective that's only 4 classes.



I'm really stressing out, and trying my hardest. My GPA is great, standing around a 3.5 cumulative, but this semester seems different. Everything is much more difficult and I'm really struggling.



Edit: I love this subject and I love learning. I just feel like I can't learn as fast as I am expected too."
Can three dimensional space be folded?,1,2,False,False,False,Physics,1489470195,True,"I was curious if its theoretically possible to ""fold"" 3D space?

Is this plausible in theory? If two massive object were near eachother could the the space near the two objects ""bend"" sufficiently towards the other, folding the space.

"Thank you, physics subreddit.",6,68,False,False,False,Physics,1489521900,True,"I don't know if this is an appropriate post or not. If it isn't, forgive me, and feel free to delete it.

I posted something about a month or two ago about going back into physics, and starting off with redoing Griffiths. I blazed through some of the problems, and I felt... happy doing physics. In a way I didn't as a student, ironically. I've unfortunately had to shelve diving into my study plans since that post due to my job training, but that ends this week, and I really cannot wait to seriously get cracking-and I can also start working out a more thorough plan of attack.

And a little glimmer of confidence too. At risk of getting personal, I've long struggled with confidence/depression issues, and I don't think I could have worked up the momentum to do this without all the encouragement I got on my thread. I know this sounds seriously weird, but I really don't think I could have of without the response I got to my post. I sincerely thank you all. It really means a lot, at risk of sounding mawkish, given that I'm someone who has posted here all of once or twice. 

As a side note, I'm trying to really adopt a healthier relationship with Reddit, so I'm probably not going to be a regular or anything, but nevertheless, I do think I should frequent the physics/math forums more. Seems like such a good resource. It'd also be good to get more tips as I go along as to where to go next. It is really reassuring to realize I'm not the only person who is taking the ""scenic route"" (I love that term. No, I didn't arrogantly waste my prime studying years in a haze of wanton addiction, dilettantism, and self-pity, I'm taking the *scenic route*, damn it) to grad school. I still don't know if it is possible, or if I will decide to do something else, but... we'll see. I'll regret it forever if I don't at least try.

So... thanks.

Question about household thermodynamics (discussion with my wife),5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1489570111,True,"Hej and greetings from Sweden!

This question might seem whimsical or trivial, but it is a ongoing discussion between my wife (teacher) and me (MD) which we can't resolve.

Situation: Our heating system is connected to a wood burning stove. There is a water pump connected to a heat exchanger. The wood burning stove heats up the water that circulates through the system, heating up the house.

The pump has different settings, circulating more qm of water/min or less qm of water/min. Lets call them 1 (slow) and 2 (fast).

Assumption a): My wife assumes that if we set the pump to setting 2 (fast) we actually consume more wood, burns faster, as energy gets taken out of the system at a faster rate.

Assumption b): I assume that the speed of the pump does not affect the rate of the wood burning. 

All of that assumes that external factors do not change (wind, outside temp, etc.) and that the temperature we aim for should remain a constant 50° celsius in the system at a constant room temperature. 

So, what assumption is right and why?

The Reddit theory of everything,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1489662197,True,"I had this idea and I need someone to tell me why it's totally stupid…

Looking at current physics theories about fundamental forces and the origin of the universe, I came to think that if gravity is irreconcilable with quantum theory, it may be because they are actually two different things from the beginning.

Imagine a universe where gravity is the only force. It would be a singularity, as all energy would attract with no opposition. Now imagine a second quantum universe, with the electromagnetic force, the strong force, the weak force and another ""explosive force"" that would forbid big chunks of energy to stay as a singularity.

If the gravity universe were to enter the quantum universe and obey its laws, it would explode into the Big Bang. The expansion of the universe today would then be this explosion ""dispersing"" in the quantum universe, or cosmic ripples in the ""explosive"" field. A good chunk of the original gravity universe could have been ejected away from the quantum universe, and formed a new singularity ready to collide with another universe with different laws.

Note that it is possible in this theory that the initial quantum universe was actually former universes (one for each force or field) that merged in some way, long before the Big Bang encounter with the gravity universe.

We know that the vector form has a straightforward operator form **r** = iħ∇_{**p**} (in momentum space **p**). What I need is the *radial component* of this operator back in momentum space **p** again. Is there a way to do this or does this not make sense? Essentially, I want to find the expectation value <**p**|*r*|**k**>, of operator *r*. |**k**> is the continuum wave state, which in position space has the expression <**r**|**k**> = exp(i**k**.**r**)."
Looking for help examining a peer-reviewed paper that claims to disprove the special theory of relativity,11,4,False,False,False,Physics,1489693786,True,"I've been in a kind of casual debate with this author of a paper that was published last year in Physics Essays (an obscure but legitimate journal). The author adamantly claims that relativity has been thoroughly disproven and likes to cite his own paper as evidence, and he does this in YouTube comments on videos about relativity.

I'm not a physicist myself, but I enjoy many science topics, and I've really gotten into relativity lately and have built up a solid understanding of it. Based on my discussions with this author, I feel pretty confident he doesn't actually understand relativity as well as he thinks he does. I've read through some of the paper and I feel like I can sense mistakes he's making in his reasoning but I'm not confident enough in my understanding and analysis to really unpack it in a compelling way.

I wonder if any physicists here would like to have a look at it and see if they could provide a succinct (if possible) and incisive rebuttal, identifying any significant mistakes that undermine his conclusions.

The paper is about 18 pages, and can be downloaded for free from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297527784_Challenge_to_the_Special_Theory_of_Relativity

And for any who might be concerned, I'm not asking just so I can flaunt it in front of him for some personal satisfaction. I'm actually genuinely curious about why his conclusions are wrong (which I'm pretty certain they must be, or somehow he's the genius that identified the fatal flaw in relativity that no one's noticed until now). If the results are interesting I may direct him here.

Thank you for your time :)"

Are Gravitational Wakes a Thing?,12,1,False,False,False,Physics,1489723164,True,"I understand at a basic level what gravitational waves are. When two very massive bodies collide, they send ripples in spacetime that propagate outward from the point of contact. But are gravitational wakes a thing? 

Does a massive body moving through spacetime cause wakes? From special relativity, I can guess that the answer is no because from the frame of reference of the massive body, it isn't actually moving through spacetime. I can see how this extends for two bodies that orbit each other. We could pick a reference frame between the two where the two bodies are motionless through spacetime and the rest of the universe rotates around them, but the same can't be true for three bodies. 

With two bodies, say Jupiter and Earth, orbiting a third, say the sun. One of the bodies will always be in motion regardless of the frame of reference that I choose. Correct? 

So ... are there gravitational wakes from that third body? And will we presumably be able to measure this effect in the future?

"Undergrad Particle Physics Term Paper Ideas (eta-prime mass, lattice QCD, CP violation, applications of HEP, nuclear medicine, ...)",5,3,False,False,False,Physics,1489875549,True,"Hello all,

 

I am in the earliest stages of writing a term paper for my undergrad particle/nuclear physics class (sorry for summarizing the title...) and I am still deciding what topic to pursue. 

 

My professor has brought a few interesting things to my attention such as the eta-prime mass discrepancy within the constituent quark mass model, predicted to be roughly 350 MeV/c^2 but measured to be 980 MeV/c^2. (I'm still undergrad so if I'm using unclear/incorrect terms please correct me) This idea interests me a lot because so many particle masses agree reasonably well with prediction, within the const. quark model, but the eta-prime is WAY off (Why is it unique? What makes this particle not agree while virtually all others do?). I talked to my professor about this idea as topic for my paper and he eluded to this issue being resolved using lattice QCD, but as an undergrad, it may be a little too much to take on as we don't cover lattice QCD in class. Does anyone have first hand experience with lattice QCD and understanding mass calculations for particles and how it differs from the constituent quark mass model?

 

Some other interesting topics I feel I could learn more about and write about are CP violation, possibly in neutrinos and understanding sterile neutrinos. I'm most interested in quantum computers but I am fairly certain that would be low-energy quantum mechanics and not have much overlap with HEP. I love the application of quantum mechanics in medical imaging and different imaging techniques but again, I believe this isn't high-energy physics so it's most likely outside the scope of the class. I mentioned the idea of medical imaging to my professor, specifically PET scans (Positron Emission Topography), my reasoning being: positron=anti-matter so it must be related to particle physics...? He steered me more towards nuclear medicine and using accelerators to attack tumors, I believe he said by accelerating neutrons and depositing their energy into tumors by calculating skin-depth of the radiation and things like that. I can't remember all the specifics so I'm hoping someone can give me more information on nuclear medicine because I love the *applications* of these topics and what better application than medicine and helping people?

 

TL;DR-- Writing a term paper on topics within particle/nuclear physics, my initial interest is understanding why the eta-prime mass does not agree with predictions of the constituent quark mass model whatsoever. Other ideas include CP violation (maybe in sterile neutrinos) and applications of HEP in nuclear medicine and possibly imagining. Any and all information on these topics would be greatly appreciated.

Riding a bicycle at significant fractions of *c*,80,161,False,False,False,Physics,1490026599,True,"As my high school AP Physics 2 teacher is introducing the class to modern physics, we began discussing the observed effects of relative movement at significant fractions of the speed of light. Our book included a side note containing a drawn picture illustrating what a cyclist travelling at 0.2c (iirc) would look like from the view of the bystanders on the sidewalk (change in time, length, and mass), but I was struck by a thought that has bothered me over the weekend.

What would happen to the wheels and what would they look like to a stationary bystander?

If the cyclist's velocity is 0.2c, the rider, frame, and really everything aside from the wheels, would experience the same changes in time, length, and mass. However, where the rubber meets the road would be stationary (relatively speaking) and would appear completely normal to an onlooker. On the other hand, the top of the wheel must be moving significantly faster than the rest of the system, since it is revolving around the hub. When observing the entire wheel from the sidewalk, how would the shape of the wheel change? All points except for the bottom ""stationary"" point contacting the road would compress and become more massive.

Lastly, when riding a bike this quickly, the radius of the wheel must determine the maximum velocity of the bicycle (to avoid the top of the wheel exceeding the speed of light), right? Well, is there a wheel size that would maximize your speed limit, or would it be best to ditch the wheels altogether and find a better use of my time?

Thanks for enduring my first real post on Reddit. I hope I didn't disregard any of the guidelines (and that my italics in the title worked) (and that my excessive use of parenthetical comments isn't excessive).

EDIT: [Here is the illustration](http://imgur.com/a/OrbhK) that I referenced, and [here](https://youtu.be/ShHzXvHSX_0) is a brief video I made to clarify the main part of my question.

A rolling coin reverses rotation when it falls over,9,19,False,False,False,Physics,1490034298,True,"I was just fiddling with a coin on my desk, and noticed this odd behavior.

The interesting thing I noticed is that when it is doing this, it is also rotating, but the direction of rotation is the opposite of what it was when the coin was rolling on edge.

Traveling at speeds close to speed of light.,28,2,False,False,False,Physics,1490039567,True,"Disclaimer : I have no education in physics whatsoever so forgive me please. 

The question I want to ask is regarding time dilation at speed close to the speed of light. 

Let's assume a ship with a crew travelling to alpha centauri at speed 0.9999c.
From the earth point of view this journey will take approximately 4 years. But wouldn't that time be much shorter for the crew on board due to time slowing down significantly at these speeds? Their clocks would slow down to a crawl making it look like everything outside of the ship is happening in fast forward. I understand that the implication is that they would be travelling faster than light from their pov, since they would travel that distance  in time much shorter than 4 years(from their perspective). I know this is not possible so where am I wrong?"

Torque to rotate spaceship pi/2 radians about z axis,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490044340,True,"A spaceship has rocket engines attached to its exterior.  They can be all the way on or all the way off, are used in pairs, and produce a torque about a principal axis but no net force.  One pair of rockets at a time are used.  At t=0, the angular velocity of the ship is zero, and the principal axes align with x_hat, y_hat, z_hat.

We want to rotate the spaceship pi/2 degrees about z so that at the end of the rotation the angular velocity is zero.
I am stuck with how to do this so that we end up with zero angular velocity. 

The torque will be completely along the z axis.  Somehow I think the angular velocity needs to be reversed for the second half of the rotation, but I am unsure of how this affects the torque. Since torque would be wXL, where w is angular velocity and L is angular momentum. If we reverse the direction of w, i.e. negative each component of w: (-w1, -w2, -w3), would this change the direction of the torque?

Can somebody provide me with guidance on how to proceed?

Advice on Graduate school in Astrophysics from non-science bachelors,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490113036,True,"Hi Reddit,
I did my bachelors in business - marketing and finance. Graduated and have been working as a market research analyst for two years. I'm 25. 

I loved Physics in junior college and up till now I continue reading books, watching lectures on Yale and MIT opencourse ware and i do the homework sometimes. 

It finally hit me that astrophysics is what I want to pursue. However, I think obtaining a second degree is extremely time consuming and pricey. I am hoping to go straight into masters instead. 

1. Is this advisable/possible? I checked and only a handful of schools don't require a bachelors in a related discipline. 

2. How can I up my chances of getting into grad school? I'm thinking of volunteering at a lab/getting an online degree. 

3. Would an online degree in physics/astrophysics even help? Which online degrees would be more respected?

4. Which schools (any country so long as English is the language of instruction) are decent and have rather 'relaxed' requirements? 

5. Any other advice 

A little about my background if it helps: I did A level physics, math, chemistry and two university modules in astronomy. I am comfortable with math, calculus, algebra etc, just kinda rusty. I also deal with data analysis on a daily basis since it's my job. 

Thank you so much. I'm pretty desperate, I finally know what I want to do with my life but it feels like quite an impossible dream :(

"Breath of the Wild Skill ""Stasis"" - Storing ""Kinetic"" energy?",7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1490135608,True,"Hey everyone, as a preface I need to say that I'm not a physics guy and I've only taken a few physics courses nearly two decades ago.

The new Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild game has an ability where the protagonist can ""freeze"" an object in space for a short duration of time.  During this time the protagonist can attack the object and, according to the in-game description, store the kinetic energy.

""Stop the flow of time for an object. Objects stopped in time will store kinetic energy. This stored energy will be expelled when the flow of time resumes. Making good use of the stored energy can move even the largest of objects. Take note of the time needed to recharge it.""

As the in-game description states -- when the timer runs out the object flies in whatever vector your attacks were landing in.  The more attacks, the farther the item flies.

Here is a short video showing the behavior in game.

https://youtu.be/6ph6pT5c9gY?t=47s

Hitting the rock without the Stasis effect will cause the rock to jiggle a bit -- maybe -- but not move.

The question we've been discussing is whether the game description is right.  Many of us non-physicists think that the energy is being stored as potential energy because we've learned that objects in motion have kinetic energy... but, is there a possibility that the description is correct due to the way the object behaves?  The best analogy I heard was that the mechanic was like a spring but I'm not sure that's entirely accurate because a spring doesn't have someone hitting it with a hammer.  :P

If someone can settle this we'd appreciate it."

For starters, even though I find myself on an interesting subreddit. I must confess that I know little about Physics, still, I respect physicists a lot. The science surrounding electricity and matter just seems so cool to me. 

OK, so I was reading about magnetic flow meters online, then coincidentally I found myself reading about the ALTAS experiment at CERN and started wondering if there was a connection. 

I read a Magnetic flow meter measures velocity of water using electromagnetic induction. I hear you use magnets in a pipe and the water which passes can then act as a conductor. Regarding the hadron collider, apparently the momentum of particles is measured to determine what type of particle it belongs to and again the system employs a magnetic field with magnets to measure bending of the EMF.  

So my question is are these two things connected in any way? Can you make a magnetic flow meter better by taking ideas from the hadron collider?

A bit confused (particle in a box).,17,4,False,False,False,Physics,1490222265,True,"Okay. 

So particle in a box, it's lowest possible energy (E) is nonzero and positive. 

Meaning that it always has some momentum. This is guaranteed by the uncertainty principle. 

---

Okay, I get that. 

But now let's talk reference frames. 

All frames of reference are equally valid. 

In the particle's own reference frame, whatever that may be, it should have zero momentum. 

Of course, in the case of using the particle's reference frame, now the potential well would be moving (and thus time dependent), but still, what exactly is blocking us from knowing it's position?

I mean, clearly we can't know it's position, because of the uncertainy principle, but if it isn't moving, I'm not sure what blocks ***us*** from knowing it's position. 

And of course, if the particle, to itself, has zero momentum, but doesn't it also *HAVE* to know it's own position (otherwise, how could it react to a potential, if it didn't know it was at the barrier)? So wouldn't the particle know both it's own position and momentum?

Plectrum flex and speed/volume (Is there a scientific way to understand the different preferences in different musical genres for thin vs thick guitar picks) [Question],2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1490271598,True,"Hi there! I've recently been doing a lot of googling and asking around about this topic (my wife is a scientist, but she can't really come up with a great answer either). 

I'm a bluegrass musician recently getting into Irish traditional music.  I play mandolin, tenor banjo, fiddle- things tuned in fifths.  

One thing I noticed about both genres is that they highly value speed and accuracy. However, the preferred plectrum choice for both genres is wildly different. Most bluegrass musicians use a rigid, fairly thick pick (1.5 mm imitation tortoise shell with little to no flex). while the Irish musicians use thin, ""floppy"" nylon picks that easily bend (.6- .8 mm). 

Bluegrass music is often a constant stream of high BPM notes, while the Irish music is maybe a little less quick but punctuated by extremely fast ornamental slurs at the beginning and end of phrases. 

So my question is: If both genres value speed and accuracy, why do they have such different pick thicknesses? Why does one genre value floppy picks while the other values rigid picks- especially when their music is so similar? What pick thickness is TECHNICALLY most efficient in transferring force, playing quickly, etc?

Just getting tired of anecdotal answers ""The thinner picks have some bounce to them"" or ""The thicker picks get more tone"" etc. "

Effect of a sudden change in the Hamiltonian on the expected value of an observabel,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490303823,True,"I recently encountered an interesting question, which I have been thinking about for some time, but I have not been able to make any progress. Any hints/help would be much appreciated!

In this particular question, the Hamiltonians are 2x2 matrices (so it is a two-state system), but I think this should be a general question...

Suppose we have a quantum mechanical system which initially is in the ground state of a Hamiltonian H0. At some time, t1 , we change the Hamiltonian suddenly to H1. Then after a time tD>t1, we measure some observable D. If we repeat this experiment many times, we get an expectation value of the operator, D. 

Now assume that the experiment is flawed, so that after a time
t2 (which is bigger than t1 but less than tD), the Hamiltonian suddenly changes back to H0. What qualitative effects will this have on the expectation value of D, ⟨D⟩?

My initial thought was that the Hamiltonian would first develop away from the ground state, and then suddenly change to develop back towards the Hamiltonian H0. Perhaps the period of these oscillations would be determined by the relative eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (because these appear in the time-dependent factor)?

**Edit:** Thanks to a user over on /r/shittykickstarters, I found this wikipedia page.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation#Method_of_operation

Under the ""Safety"" section, there's this little snippet:

>In UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.

>For human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and skin cancer. Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the cornea and temporary or permanent vision impairment, up to and including blindness in some cases. UV can damage the retina of the eye.

So, basiclly, either this thing has no way to generate the wavelengths needed to actually do anything (Most likely) or it's the world's tiniest little UV cancer machine."

Special Relativity Paradox,5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490360200,True,"Hey guys, I'm sure you're all familiar with the twin paradox and how its resolution lies with the relativity of simultaneity (if you choose to solve by assuming all frames are inertial).

I have thought of a scenario that seems breaks special relativity and I can't seem to resolve it. I suspect that the solution lies again with simultaneity and also addition of relativistic velocities but I can't figure it out. Here is my 'paradox':


Suppose a spaceship moving in +x at 0.5c passes by a stationary observer and synchronises its clock with him. Also suppose that an identical spaceship moving in -x at 0.5c passes the observer at the same time (in the observer's frame) and synchronises its clock. So the three clocks are all synchronised and from the perspective of the observer the system is symmetric in x.

13 years pass in the observer's frame which means the observer can calculate that 10 years have passed in each of the ships' frames. However the astronauts agreed that after ten years in their frame they would send signals to the stationary observer with a time stamp saying that ten years have passed.


The signals take 6.5 years to reach the observer. Each time signal from each ship is identical; they both say ""sent after 10 years"".

Now the observer gets in a space ship and travels up to meet up with one of the ships and shows the astronaut the two identical signals proving that each astronaut had aged the same. But, from the astronaut's perspective, her ship was at rest and the observer and other ship were moving at some relativistic velocity away with time slowed in their frame. The observer has just showed the astronaut that time slowed in her frame as much as in the other ship's frame. How could this be?

Quantum Mechanic/Entanglement and FTL communication.,8,23,False,False,False,Physics,1490391216,True,"Ok so here is my thought experience on using quantum entanglement to use as FTL communication. 

So I was thinking how would this be possible until I read that it cannot, because if one side measure the particle the other one will change automatically, but you wouldn't know who caused the change in the first place, so no information is transferred real time, you can only confirm the entanglement later when you use non FTL communication to compare results.

But on the other hand, if 2 particle is entangled, before you measure one of them, its possible that both can be Electron or positron or spin up or spin down, because both are in wave mode so nothing is determined.

But if you can measure the container of the particle, measure whatever the boxes holding the particle has changed charge or spin, but not measure the particle directly, can you transmit information that way?

Lets say, me and my friend are located in 2 opposite side of the solar system and we synchronize our clock and velocity to make sure our time stays the same.

We each hold 1000 boxes of entangled particle, lets say at 12pm, my friend decide to open 1 box = yes, 2 box = no.

Before he open his box, both of our boxes are in neutral state (wave state), where the charges and spin can be both positive or negative or up/down or left right. At my side, I put each of my 1000 boxes under a very sensitive measurement equipment designed to measure a change in charge or spin motion to the box itself. So if my friend open up 2 boxes, then 2 of my measurement machine will detect a charge/spin change. (2 box = no)

Will this work? Since I never opened my side of the box, so I cannot cause the entangled collapse on my/his side. I only detected some kind of change to my box when he open up his box, so in the end, I'm not measuring the particle, I'm only measure the possible changes to the containers of the particle. But the fact that I measure some kind of change to the box, that information can be used to transmit information.

Would this work?"

Help with CM and relative Coordinates problem,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490500652,True,"Two particles of mass m1 and m2 are joined by a massless spring of natural length L and a force constant k.  Initially, m2 is resting on a table and I am holding m1 vertically above m2 at a height L.  At time t=0, I project m1 vertically upward with initial velocity v_0.  Find the positions of the two masses at any subsequent time t (before either mass returns to the table) and describe the motion.

The solution is supposed to be 
y1= L + m1/M*v_0t-1/2*g*t^2 +(m2*v_0/M*w)sin(wt)
y2= m1/Mv_0*t -(1/2)g*t^2-(m1*v_0/M*w)sin(wt)

I set up a Lagrangian for R (center of Mass) and r (relative distance). 

Here I use ""u"" to denote reduced mass.

I ended up with 
u*r"" = -(1/2)k(r-L)
which gave me the formula
r(t)= (v_0/w)sin(wt) by plugging in initial conditions.

For R, 
I found by plugging in initial conditions
R(t) = -(1/2)g*t^2+ (m1*v_0/M)t-L*m2/M (I suspect a mistake here...)

However, when I use the formulas below,
y1 = R + (m2/M)r 
y2 = R -(m1/M)r

I do not get the desired formulas.
Can someone please help me find where I went wrong?"
Why does it cost so much to get into APS conferences?,15,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490510793,True,"Or really any physics conference. I recently got a job at an airline, so I get free or ridiculously cheap flights anywhere in the world, and this got me super psyched about being able to sit in on modern physics lectures, but when I looked up registration fees they are...huge. The ""April"" APS conference is only like $50 (for APS members that are also undergrads - the prices go up from there) but some others have registration fees that are over a thousand dollars! Often even the *invited speaker* fees are several hundred dollars, which seems *tremendously* backwards.

Anyone know what the deal is? I understand that the organizers have to pay for the venue, but I've run events with a few hundred people (LAN parties) at facilities that could easily host physics conferences, and the entry fees for those were no more than $20 - and we had money to spare after everything. Is someone just raking in profits here, or...???

P.S. ""April"" is in quotes because this year's ""April"" APS conference was in January for some reason.

edit: One other question. I went to the 2015 April APS (which was actually in April that time around) in Baltimore and while they did give me a name tag, there was nobody actually checking for name tags at the door. I just didn't wear my nametag one day and nobody even noticed. Are most conferences like this?"

Question about non-relational entities,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490517735,True,"There has been an idea rolling around in my head for years about how to digest non relational entities as we biologically are relational data machines, I think I came up with a description that explains my perspective:

""When you have a non relational entity, in that a comparison cannot be made to any other body besides itself, it effectively would be in a superposition of existence and non-existence as only it alone can only be used to define itself. It would assume the qualities of both polar states as well as all states in between and all possible would be existent at the same time as it could not have time applied nor sustain observation without collapse.""

I fee like there's probably already some smart person who thought this up and went further, and it seems similar to some aspects of quantum mechanics, but I have no idea bearing on this subject other than my own internal dabbling.

As an example of what I mean, in my case it was when I first learned  about PDE's and how the answer we give to many questions is often truncated (and yes I know that it works with great precision and it's a laughable concern, same example goes for every Taylor expansion or perturbation theory). This may seem stupid but for young me it meant physics just lost some of its magic of always finding THE answer, this is obviously due to the fact that I had a false concept of physics, one could call it romanticised.

Nevertheless the hunger for knowledge kept me at it, so here I am, making my masters in QFT and advanced GR.

my question is, how do i determine the the degree of impact on looking at them seperately in respect to looking at the factors simultaneous collectively?
Because these factors have to impact eachother aswell.

Is there a chance of ever getting Journals to use PDF meta-data correctly?,3,8,False,False,False,Physics,1490621904,True,"So, I've been doing some literature searching, and I've been encountering the age of problem of: The PDFs given by the journals all have numeric names, so I want to rename them since this project isn't worth putting into an organizing program yet (and honestly have descriptive file names isn't a bad thing.)

Now, in principle, renaming files shouldn't be a problem.  I use a wonderful application called [Siren](https://www.scarabee-software.net/en/siren.html) that is actually made to do batch renaming and can rename PDF's based on their meta data.  The only problem is, that half of the journals out there don't fill out the meta-data, like ""Title"" or ""Date.""  So, 90% of the time, I'm back to square one.

Question about time dilation in special relativity?,5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490666129,True,"Here is the question:

As you pilot your space utility vehicle at a constant speed toward the moon, a race pilot flies past you in her spaceracer at a constant speed of 0.800 c , relative to you. At the instant the spaceracer passes you, both of you start timers at zero.

a) At the instant when you measure that the spaceracer has traveled 1.30×108m1.30×108m past you, what does the race pilot read on her timer?

I used the time dilation formula and got .325 seconds. This makes sense, because time is running slower for the race pilot spaceship.

b) When the race pilot reads the value calculated in the previous part on her timer, what does she measure to be your distance from her?

Relative to her, you are moving at .8c in the opposite direction. Travelling at this speed for .325 seconds gives 7.8×107m7.8×107m
c) At the instant when the race pilot reads the value calculated in part A on her timer, what do you read on yours?

NOW HERE IS MY PROBLEM

I realize that from my original calculation in A, that when the faster spacecraft is at .325 seconds, the slower one is at .52. However, I do not understand this. Wouldn't you have to do a second time dilation calculation? With respect to the race pilot, after .325 seconds shouldn't the space utility vehicle have time run slower because the race pilot observes the vehicle moving at .8c in the opposite direction? After applying this calculation, I got .195 seconds. However, it was wrong. Why is the second time dilation calculation wrong for this situation?"

Turned off by first year physics course (Mechanics),12,2,False,False,False,Physics,1490671019,True,"Back in high school I got something like 92-96% in physics by not truly understanding what was happening in the problem but by algebraic manipulation of Newton's second law, kinematics laws, etc.  I also didn't understand math 12 concepts (e.g. probability, equations of lines, etc.) since I had a bad memory at the time and couldn't plug and chug like I could in physics.  

Now that I'm in University I aimed to move away from my surface level understanding.  It has worked for the most part in Calculus III (I can derive some formulas like equation of tangent planes, I understand the mechanics of partial differentiation, etc.) but it's not working for Physics (the engineering one).  I seemed to have focused on the parts of physics that we're not really tested on (not sure how to better describe what I mean here).  It's nearing the end of the term now and I'm realizing that the plug and chug, algebraic manipulation strategy probably would yield a higher grade than I have now.  I'm going to try to do as many problems and hope I remember the strategies stick.  Working super hard in hopes that  may pass the final and thus the course.  

Maybe it was meant to be as I realized physics wasn't enjoyable for me.  I'm not even sure why exactly I don't find it enjoyable.  I find math enjoyable for some reason.

"AP Physics teacher, need help with conservation of angular momentum problem",2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1490725535,True,"Hello all, I am an AP Physics I teacher and I am covering rotation right now. I wrote a problem on angular momentum, but it doesn't seem to make sense when I do it out. 

Here is the problem as I wrote it: http://imgur.com/a/TmOUK 

Using angular momentum, my solution has the final two gear system moving at a greater angular velocity than the initial gear started with.

Winitial = 20 rad/s

IiWi = IfWf

Idisk = mr^2 

IlargeWinitial = 0.004 kgm^2 / s

Since the gears rotate without slipping, their final angular velocities are the same. However, the small gear moves clockwise, so its angular velocity is negative. 

IlargeWfinal - IsmallWfinal = 0.004 kgm^2 / s 

Ismall = 0.000015 kgm^2

Ilarge = 0.0002 kgm^2

(Ilarge - Ismall)Wfinal = 0.004 kgm^2 / s

(0.000185)Wfinal = 0.004 kgm^2 / s

Wfinal = 21.62 rad/s 

In this solution, the system is moving at a higher angular velocity than it started with, which does not make conceptual sense to me. Is angular momentum not conserved in this case? Should I be using rotational kinetic energy instead? I want to make sure I'm teaching this correctly.

Thank you all in advance for your help."

Please explain this about particle colliding,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1490742443,True,So as well know particle collidng is done in Cern and it is done speeding up protons inside  the LHC and colliding them.

Is constructal theory complete and utter BS?,16,14,False,False,False,Physics,1490786614,True,"[Constructal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructal_law) has been popping in my newsfeed every now and then for a few years, probably more often than average due to the fact that its author is from my country. Presumably, it's a groundbreaking discovery in thermodynamics with ramifications in pretty much any field. I'd never actually checked it out in detail until recently, after [it was used to explain wealth inequality](https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/physics-can-predict-wealth-inequality), of all things. 

I've now read some of the papers in this ""field"" and my instincts tell me there's something very fishy going on. My instincts and the rampant self-citing that Adrian Bejan, the author of the theory, indulges in. I've read a review of the ""advances"" in the field, written by him, in which almost all the cited works were his. 

Problem is, they get by peer review, and have gotten by for 20 years now. The guy even wrote a few books on the subject, in which he applies it to basically everything. I mean, really, everythin. He literally says that [constructal law can explain why Africans are faster runners](https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/dne/5/3/454).

My level of mathematics is typical for an EE student: multivariable calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics, ODE, some PDE, aspects of complex analysis, and Fourier transforms. I have also taken a full year course on electromagnetics field theory, but mostly from an engineer's perspective. I have some free time and would love to have a deeper understanding of the Physics I studied during my freshman years. I want a book that doesn't shy away from using mathematics (those I mentioned above) extensively. What I'm not looking for is a book that pretends I'm learning for the first time the law of conservation of energy or electromagnetic induction. I already know this stuff. For instance, even though I had learned Newton's laws of motions since I was 12 or 13, it wasn't until my dynamics class that everything came together when we derived and solved a 2nd order OED that showed that planetary orbits are indeed elliptical.

To what DEGREE is string theory true? Revisiting a question I asked here 5-6 years ago as a freshman. Been lurking all these years and still haven't seen it resurface.,18,3,False,False,False,Physics,1490817521,True,"Years ago somebody on here told me (paraphrased):

""While I don't believe in the deep reaches of string theory or any of its current proposed forms, I have to wonder how string theory could NOT be true.""

That day I didn't feel like I had any more grasp on the validity of string theory, but I definitely remembered that response.

More and more over the years, I have observed theoretical physicists working within the mathematical fabric that string theory produces, and speaking about the most general characteristics of it as *facts*... seemingly as if they were practically certain the theory had to be true on some level. 

For example, I've observed that the idea that particles are strings seems *accepted*, even if the confusion surrounding the vast set of implications resulting from the idea are still in hot debate and seethed in contradiction and lack of experimental evidence.

The above is still a very tame example. I've even observed theoretical physicists speaking about the holographic principle as if it were fact.

**MY QUESTION IS:**

*How can talented and sane physicists speak about these things as if they were factual?*

The Higgs Boson and Gravity,9,3,False,False,False,Physics,1490817641,True,"I wonder if anyone can suggest why the discovery of the Higgs Boson has not revealed more to us about the nature of Gravity.

Regions dense in Higgs excitations, ie. matter would also create a gravity well.
  
Shouldn't the discovery of the Boson have told us about why Gravity is so weak, or why it can work over vast distances, or how it fits with the other forces and given some sort of unified theory.

I am just bit disappointed it doesn't seen to have led anywhere."

Layman wondering about some fluid dynamics.,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1490887903,True,"Hello, 

What has sparked this question is the observation that my blood pressure decreases a bit when extra fluid is added to my system. I realize that it very well could be a purely medical reason explained by the interaction between blood and the added fluid, I'll ask my doctor about that when I see her. 

Although, googling around a bit lead me to some mentionings of Bernoullis Law, which describes the relation between flow speed, pressure, and varying area of cross sections of pipes within a closed system. Now the relation between v1A1=v2A2 seems straight forward to me, flow velocity is greater where the pipe is narrower. What I don't quite grasp is the change of pressure; is it increasing or or decreasing when the pipe is more narrow? 

Wikipedia also brings up that this law only applies to incompressable liquids, and the following elaboration on what applies to compressible liquids is too complicated for me. Is it possible to summarize it so it's understandable on the same level as what applies to incompressible fluids?

Further on if we get back to fluid being added to the blood system, it could also have something to do with veins being slightly elastic. Looking at the same situation from a physical viewpoint, is there an explanation for what happens when the amount of fluid is increased within a closed system with pipes that are elastic? I'm thinking it might fall under the same formulas that applies for compressable fluids, but that's just my guess. 

I'd be very grateful if someone could explain this to me, and I hope that it's relevant enough to this sub that it can spark some discussion :)"

I think I understand what he's trying to say, but I'm not sure. Therefore I want to tell you guys what I think he's saying and just tell me if I'm right or where I'm making a mistake.

**My understanding of the theory**

The guy explain that we perceive things in 2D. Our eyes look at things from a certain angle (the angle you're currently looking from at an object) and because of the light that is shed on the object we see the object the way we see it.

http://kingofwallpapers.com/object/object-004.jpg

If you look at the above picture of a dice it's as if you're looking at it slightly from above. We all understand that this is the angle of the picture (if we imagine that the surface the dice is on is a table):

http://imgur.com/a/ztilY

Basically the red lines (1) show the vision of a person if the picture of the dice would be like a screenshot of a persons view at that very moment. 

We can not see in 3D, even though we think we can. What we actually do is view the object from a different angle which changes the light that sheds on the object, which causes us to see how it looks from the other side. We then remember what it looked like from the front side. Once we've seen all sides of an object our memory bundles all these kind of screenshots that we made and then our minds form the overall look of an object. We do not actually see in 3D because we can only see something from one side at a time. The only way we can perceive what things look like is because we can change our vision by changing the angle from which we look at things. Is that right? Basically the blue lines (2) in the last picture show the vision of someone looking at the dice from the other side.

So if I understand this concept correctly a person that would be able to see in 3D would not have to move his head to see what the other side of an object looks like because he can see it from all angles at the same time? Then again I think the last sentence is not correct because we can not really imagine what 3D vision would be like because our minds can not imagine what it looks like because all our knowledge is based on 2D vision. I mean we think we know what an object look like after seeing it from all sides, but can we ever really see an object from all sides. I mean basically an object has infinite sides and our vision is only limited in length and width (the 2D concept). So actually what we think an object looks like is just based on our memory bundle of all the sides we've seen the object from, taking into account the limitedness of our vision. Then again vision is sort of translated to the human brain, but what if our brain makes a mistake and we don't really see what things look like. We can touch things to decide what their shape is, but how do we know if this is really correct? I mean 'feeling' is also based on our vision. When you feel an object with your eyes closed you try to imagine what it looks like based on the reference your brain makes through the knowledge that it has acquired by looking at things. Right? Someone with big hands might think an object is smaller than someone with small hands thinks it is.

The guy in the video says 4D vision would be like seeing all things in 3D. I don't understand what this means, is that because I can only imagine what 3D looks like based on my 2D perception?

This concept really interests me and I would like to hear if you guys agree with what I wrote. If not, please feel welcome to give your own opinion."

Any good resource recommendation for deeper insight into electrodynamics?,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1490972697,True,"Hello Everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this post.
I have my Masters in Geophysics, and landed a semi-R&D role at a Oil and Gas Wireline Company. We are dealing with tools that is mainly operated by both nuclear and electrodynamics. I have spent the last few months brushing up on my electrodynamics of what I learned back in Bachelor days. From the beginning of Electrostatic forces - Circuits AC/DC - Electromagnetism, the whole works.
I am using the free full-fledged physics textbook (University Physics with Modern Physics 13th Ed.), and as resourceful as it is, especially at helping me understand the concepts of how our beautiful nature works, I find it lacking practicality.
I was wondering if anyone here can please direct me to resources, that dive deeper into electrodynamics and how to use it in an engineering sense. A textbook of some kind that is bareable to read and easy to follow. My online search has led me, to what seems like, authors who know they know a bunch and would rather bombard the reader with fancy, sometimes very unecessary, mathematics with no justification of how he/she went from Step 1 to Step 2 and the thinking involved, than to actually take the time to ""educate"" the reader in the desired field.
If anyone here as resources that could point me that direction I would appreciate it! Maybe some of you know of some good university textbooks?

Virtual Particle Isolation in a Vacuum (Hypothetical Thought Experiment),11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1491087015,True,"If you had an ideal vacuum and a device that could snatch up a virtual particle from within the vacuum, quickly stabilize it, and remove it before it got a chance to balance it's energy out back into nothing within the vacuum what would happen?

How would the properties of the vacuum change? Since the system was already an ideal vacuum before the removal of the virtual particle would it have a net negative energy state having less than nothing now so to speak? Could the ideally vacuumed space now with a negative energy state also now have a net charge due to the inability of the virtual particle, assuming it had a charge before being removed, being able to be re-absorbed into nothing?

Or perhaps empty space has an infinite ability to re-balance out quantum state discrepancies on its own? This would bother my notions of conservation, as if empty space had an unending well to draw upon to eradicate quantum imbalance and discrepancy.

Perhaps the overall evaporation and disintegration of our universe and all our known reality is this property of empty space at work, and since the big bang is such a large quantum fluctuation it's taking far more time for empty space to re-absorb this all as opposed a virtual particle."

Help choosing university degree,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1491125917,True,"I'll be posting this on r/chemistry aswell. That way i'll get answers from both sides of the argument

Alright so im in the second year of swedish Gymnasium (think it's like high school/college right?), studying natural sciences, which includes all of the base courses like chemistry, physics and biology. It's now about time for me to start looking for a university degree. Only issue is that i dont know which degree i should choose based on my interests, and none at school seems to be able to help me. This is why im asking here. 

What im interested in is material science. Making new solid materials with useful properties (especially unorganic compounds). But while i do like the process of synthesis and of understanding the technical use of materials, i'm mostly interested in the theoretical components behind it all. Understanding why something has a specific property, all the way down to the quantum level is what i like the most. 

So here's the dilemma. If I choose a material science degree, it seems to mostly be a surface overview, cutting out the deeper theoretical part that I love. 

If I choose chemistry then ill get a bit more of a deep overview, especially if I choose quantum chemistry. But won't I have to go through hours of organic (plastics are gun though) and biochemistry that i dont care much about? Also wont the focus be more on the practical synthesis part of chemistry? 

Now if I choose either of these, it seems as though ill get locked away from most quantum based courses later as they in sweden atleast seem to require a physics degree. but i really dont want to choose a degree in physics if i'll have to go through all those ours of classical mechanics that, while usefull, I dont find that fun, aswell as losing the chemical part that i like a lot. 

I would be really gratefull if i could get some tips on what i should choose and maybe even where (im open to studying abroad). It's an important decision and i don't want to screw it all up by choosing the wrong degree!"

"It's a very old and long joke, yet still one of my favorites",2,21,False,False,False,Physics,1491228238,True,"The following is supposedly an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid-term. The answer by one student was so ""profound"" that the professor shared it with colleagues via the Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.

Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:
First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.

As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.
2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.
So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in Hell before I go out with you"", and take into account the fact that I went out with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.

The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore extinct . . . leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being, which explains why last night Teresa kept shouting ""Oh, my God!""

Isn’t it possible that at very large scales the inverse square law model of gravity just doesn’t hold up? Just as Einstein determined that Newton’s laws of motion only hold up for velocities much smaller than that of light, perhaps the universally accepted gravitational equation only holds up for smaller (i.e., less than galactic) values of mass and/or physical size. I’m sure this has been discussed here before, but again - I’m new to Reddit."

Schrodinger Equation,9,5,False,False,False,Physics,1491253060,True,"I am trying to understand how Schrodinger came up with this equation. According to Walter Moore in Schrodinger: Life and Thought, ""Schrodinger's first derivation of a wave equation for particles was based entirely upon the relativistic theory as given in de Broglie's thesis, but he did not publish this equation. The crucial test of any theory would be its application the the problem of the hydrogen atom. At the nonrelativistic level, it must at least be able to reproduce the results of the old quantum theory of Bohr for the energy levels and quantum numbers. A relativistic theory should also be capable of explaining the Sommerfeld equation for the fine structure and perhaps improving it"" (194).

From what I understand so far, the Schrodinger equation is meant to give us a wave equation that describes a quantum system. Since de Broglie proposed matter as waves, this implied a wave equation should satisfy the representation of particles in a quantum system. Schrodinger's goal was to find this thing that could give us this equation. 

Some questions I have:
What does Moore mean by ""relativistic theory"" in the de Broglie thesis? Does relativistic just mean we consider time?
How is Schrodinger building something to test the theory in its application to the Hydrogen atom? If we consider the hydrogen atom, we must be talking three dimensions, so Schrodinger's initial attempts must have been toward a three dimensional PDE. I'm not seeing the relevance of solutions to the one dimensional harmonic oscillator, that I find in every textbook, when considering application to a three dimensional hydrogen atom. (except maybe if we think of projecting the motion of a particle in a plane to one dimension, since we have 3 planes to consider)
How does this thing produce the Bohr energy levels and quantum numbers? What was his nonrelativistic consideration for this?
What is the Sommerfeld fine structure and how could his equation help explain it?
How do we end up with H^hat Psi = E Psi? What do we mean by the Hamiltonian and where did it come from in his original derivation of the equation?

I apologize if this seems confusing and undirected. There are quite a few gaps in my understanding and I'm struggling to find places to start. I've been very preoccupied with how we even ended up with a Schrodinger equation and what he was thinking about/concerned with when he was attempting to find it. Unfortunately, nothing I've read, including the original work, has helped me better understand all of this. I would appreciate any corrections to my understanding and suggestions for places I could focus my research."

I am currently a sophomore in college working on a math major.  This semester I'm taking the electricity & magnetism portion of university physics.

The math part of it is no problem to me.  The problem is the actual physics.  In math, everything is precisely defined and easy for me to follow.  In physics, everything just seems so ""hand-wavey"".  There's always this nagging feeling that something isn't quite right.  For example, just what exactly is a positive and negative charge?  It was never adequately explained (the example of rubbing silk on glass was used), and eventually I just had to accept that these things exist and work with them.  Or the concept of an electric field - the book says to envision that a body ""somehow modifies the space around it"".  OK, but what *is* it? 

I realize that math is all about abstractions, but I was under the impression that physics was about explaining the real world.  If so, then why am I ""envisioning"" something somehow doing something?  I understand *that* charged particles behave a certain way, but *why*?  Why isn't this thing rigorously defined?

I've tried working more problems, and I just do not feel like I'm actually learning physics.  I can't seem to see the problems as anything beyond solving for some value, whether it's the current, or the magnetic field, or whatever else.  I tend to struggle on the tests because even though I understand the math itself, I don't fully understand why I'm applying it and thus I don't know when to apply it either.

Is my brain just not wired correctly for this?  Is there a better way to learn physics?  This is likely the last physics class that I will take, but I still want a good grade.

Yet there are quite a few problems that i am unable to solve due to the way they are solved. Now those are problems that probably wont be asked on the exam tomorrow. Yet you cant spot them beforehand when practicing. Meaning that in the middle of the problem i have to skip to the next problem. To possibly find out that i have to skip that one too...

1. So apparently, if you have a source that can output high enough voltage, electricity can travel through distill water. Why is that?

2. At 5:45 in the video, Grant slowly pulls out one of the wire from the distilled water. You can see that the wire seems to be sucking out water. Why is that?

3. And we also know that electricity will travel along the path with least resistance. So normally, electricity should choose to travel through the air rather than distill water. However, at 6:30 in the video, Grant proved it otherwise. So how come the electricity traveled through distill water instead of air?"

Can someone explain what my dad (english SL) is trying to say?,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1491366888,True,"In my mind: Convoluted Time

G = gravitational constant
c = speed of light in a vacuum
s is the SI unit of time, the second.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time
Quantum Time involves E - discrete quantum energy unit. Which linked/defined with c & G & λ/ambient.
Convoluted because rate of change doesn't applied to c (EM ElectroMagnetic) & G (field), therefore time doesn't exists.
More confounding, EM & G are actually energy shifting in λ/ambient.
since I can't ignore space (dimension - denote it with S) since it's interwining with time - according to modern physics. Hypothetically when S is expanding at or greater than c/light-speed, then EM&G are falling backward with energy state in absolute negative.
While ongoing theory in physics today conjecturing S expansion based on EM red-shifting (actually losing energy state - i.e. longer wave length). But what's about λ/ambient? Sure, it is easier to fit everything into expanding space but what if space(dimension) is contracting? Universe(as we know of) would gain energy right? So where is time fits in this non-static space?

The day at the lab started above ground, first signing a bunch of papers, then trying on mining gear (consisting of heavy rubber boots, lined with steel around the entire foot, coveralls with a bunch of reflectors, a safety belt, thick gloves, a hard hat and a head lamp) as the lab is in the lowest part of the still active Creighton mine.

Then we had wait for the 8:20 miscellaneous ride down (there are only about 5 or 6 trips for people down to the mine of the lab everyday, so if you miss one you are kind of screwed for a while). After everyone gets into the elevator it starts its almost free-fall descent of 6800 (~2.1km) at about ~50ft/s (~15m/s). You constantly have to keep your ears from popping as a giant column of air rushes past the elevator (the pressure at the bottom is about 25% more than on the surface). After reaching the bottom you sign in with your second numbered tag and start a 2km trek through dirt, mud, and gravel in a very dirty mine and finally reach the lab. Before going in you must wash off your boots to get all of the mud and dirt off. Then you step inside where you take off your boots, belt, hard hat and gloves. Next, you reach the shower area where you remove the rest the mining gear and all of your clothes so you can shower. After your shower, you are supplied with clothes that stay down in the lab so they do not get contaminated. From there you sign in again and then that is when you can start the tour."

q qbar g and group theory,8,12,False,False,False,Physics,1491407593,True,"Hi there everyone, I have a question about something I was hoping someone could enlighten me on.

Suppose you have a q\bar{q} system in the simple quark model; you can use the formalism of the simple quark model to classify hadrons into multiplets (looking at mesons/hadrons), where 'lightest' (anti)quarks transform in the (anti)fundamental representation of SU(3)_flavour, and this is an approximate symmetry attributed to quark flavour via masses of c/b/t are significantly greater that those of u/d/s. From here you can attain the good quantum numbers of such hadrons fairly easily.

You can do a similar thing for quarks under SU(3)_colour, where you assign the quarks in a fundamental repn, say
r=(1,0,0)
g=(0,1,0)
b=(0,0,1)

and the 8 gluons (plus the ninth hidden gluon) in the adjoint of SU(3) colour (i.e. 3x3 matrices). ignoring normalisations:
g1=
((0 1 0),
(1 0 0),
(0 0 0))
.
.
.
g8=
((0 0 0),
(0 1 0),
(0 0 -1))

My question is, is there a similar way discussed in the literature, to classify hybrid hadrons? for example, Is there a systematic algorithm, just like in the eightfold way, to generate multiplets of hybrid hadrons? 

Only, upon reading most books reference only the simple quark model, most examples seem to only discuss meson multiplets, or baryon multiplets, but not multiplets for cases where you may have excited gluons?

Or must one indirectly infer them somehow from the simple quark model?
 
If anyone could direct me to literature about this, say the construction of hybrid multiplets, via Young tableaux/Clebsch-Gordon coefficients/group theory, that would be amazing. Hopefully my question makes sense :)

Half the Speed of Light is Upper Limit?,8,0,False,False,False,Physics,1491414914,True,"If a fundamental law is that no object can travel faster than the speed of light, wouldn't that mean that if any object is made of atoms, that object could not travel faster than 1/2 the speed of light?  Since those spinning parts of atoms spinning in the plane of travel would have some parts moving opposite the direction of travel for part of their spinning revolutions and on the other part of their revolution they must move faster than the object. The parts moving opposite the object's direction move slower than the object and those parts of atoms in the object travelling in the forward direction of the object move faster, but they could not exceed the speed of light.  Would that limiting speed be 1/2 the speed of light?  Maybe not, but the limiting speed would certainly be less than the speed of light.  Would all this be moot as the closer an object gets to the speed of light, the slower the atoms' parts spin?

Advice on a final math elective,5,1,False,False,False,Physics,1491447215,True,"Going into my junior year as an undergraduate. I'm required to take 2 math electives after completing differential equations - so far, I have linear algebra, and for the second I'm torn between discrete and complex analysis. Discrete fits my schedule better, so there's that.

A bit on what I want - I don't see myself pursuing a career in theory. I do want to go to grad school, but it would most likely be for nuclear engineering rather than physics. For this reason, I think I'll probably be better off with discrete, since I'm trying to learn some programming, and I've been told discrete is useful for that. But also, one time I watched a bunch of videos on the Riemann hypothesis and it sounded cool? Would it be practical to take a class in complex analysis if I don't plan on going deep into QFT or anything like that?

"Feeling pretty demoralized and disconnected with my degree at the moment. Is this just a normal phase in studying physics? If so, how long will it last?",37,117,False,False,False,Physics,1491488307,True,"*Sorry if this is the wrong place for this post, but it seemed too long to put into the other threads*


I'm nearing the end of my undergraduate degree, and everything is starting to both ramp up and wrap up in terms of coursework/research/extracurriculars. I'm starting to find myself 'stepping back' from the degree though. It's more common now that I'll just leave a small, simple mistake in my work if I think it's going to be too much effort to fix. I used to rewrite my assignments if I made a mistake that had to be crossed out because it looked messy, but now I just cross it out and leave it. I'm buying heavily into the 80/20 rule now (20% of your total effort gets you 80% of your grade). I'm not as enthusiastic about attending class anymore, and I'm finding it hard to find the motivation to attend my 8am lectures. The whole thing just doesn't have the same 'wow' factor that it did when I had just started my degree; it feels more like a job in some ways. The classes don't feel like an opportunity anymore, just a chore. The work is harder and I'm feeling the sting from realising just how many gaps I have in my understanding. 

My honours work has already been largely planned and I started work on it quite a while ago, so I'm just going through the motions in that sense. I don't have to worry about applications or finding a supervisor or a research question or anything, I just have to show up. I'm planning on going to grad school in the hopes of entering academia, but it seems like I'm supposed to have this burning, excitable passion about my subject and I just don't. It could just be a side-effect of long term stress or burnout though, and I'm hoping that I might 'relearn' some of the passion I once had if that's the case. I have seriously considered dropping classes or my entire degree over the last couple of weeks, although my professors convinced me otherwise. I'm not failing anything, I'm not suicidal or experiencing any other extenuating circumstances, and I haven't discovered any passion for anything else, I just feel 'meh'. 

Has anyone here ever experience a stage like this in their education/career? How long does it last? Does it go away at all, or is this a sign that maybe I should pursue something else?"

Figuring out acceleration after an impact,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1491587734,True,"(Mod's, please remove this if it does not meet the sub's rules.)

Hi everyone! I am a PhD student (biology) with a physics problem. My project involves investigating concussions and traumatic brain injury. The model we use to look at these types of injuries is to have a lateral impact at the head of the rat which accelerates the rat's head, thereby causing the concussive injury. My apparatus propels a weight (mass and velocity is known) at the head of the rat to achieve this impact. [A simple illustration showing how it works.](http://imgur.com/a/0tP7p)

I am trying to figure out how to determine the acceleration of the rat's head after the impact, and am stuck. I originally thought to assume an elastic collision and equate the kinetic energy of the propelled weight to the work done on the rat's head, and then simply rearrange to find acceleration (Ek=w=fd=mad // a = Ek/md). However, that didn't really work for a couple of reasons, one of which is that I don't know how to determine  the displacement over which the force of the impact is done over during the collision. 

A paper I have read about a similar apparatus to mine (Marmarou A, et al. A New Model of Diffuse Brain Injury in Rats. Part I: Pathophysiology and Biomechanics. J Neurosurg. 1994. 80(2):291-300) was able to generate acceleration-time graphs similar to what I want to generate, but they used a dual-mass-spring damper model, and I have no idea how to derive something similar to this for my purposes.

Can someone poke holes in my crazy theory that would explain dark matter and eliminate time paradoxes?,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1491598009,True,"It's pretty common to think of time as a 4th dimension. But first think some qualities of the three spacial dimensions that can navigate.  I'm in one, and only one, intersection of those three dimensions, that's why it's impossible for you to see me next to you, when I'm actually at my computer. But sometimes we tend to think of ourselves as being in multiple positions in time. For example, we think if could navigate time like we can space and time travel back to yesterday, we'd find ourselves there doing what we did yesterday. Could it be, that like the more familiar three spacial dimensions, we wouldn't find ourselves there at all, because we're here/now, not there/then. Ok, maybe a weird take on time travel, but would conveniently solve some of those annoying time paradoxes... How can you kill your younger self if your younger self wouldn't be there to kill? But it raises a question, if we're not there, is something else? Different stuff floating around in space, just in a different place on the dimension of time that we can't see? 

Keep that in your back pocket. Now let's consider gravity. In a closed box, you can't tell the difference between acceleration and gravity... Could gravity then, just be acceleration through time? Think of gravity like water up against a boat as it moves through a lake. The pressure of the water is greater right before the boat hits it. 

Now, if objects are only in one spot in time (and if we could navigate through time back to yesterday the earth wouldn't be there), could dark matter's gravity simply be matter that's almost ""synced"" in time with us, like pressure in water right before in front of a boat hits it, but we can't see the object because the object just isn't in the same time as us? 

If this was true that would mean that we see dark matter's gravity  as constant, and never the objects that create it, because the objects are right behind us in time. It would also mean that if you could stand still in time, we'd see things zipping in and out of existence with extra gravity/dark matter right before they popped in. Maybe early in the universe that's how we would have seen things, but as time has gone by the things moving faster through time are way ahead of us, and those moving slower are way behind, so we're left with the things we can see directly, and things really close to us that create dark matter. 

Anyway, that's my deep thought for the day. I'm no scientist, I'm a computer programmer/business guy, but I really spend a lot of time watching universe shows and understanding quantum mechanics theories at a high level, so I'm sure some smarter person than me can tell my why the above scenario is impossible or other implications it would have if true.

"In a gun with a direct blowback action, would a lighter buffer reduce the peak energy impulse transferred to the buffer tube?",1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1491599288,True,"I've been trying to figure this out because I'm building an AR-15 in 9mm which has a direct blowback action and I want the peak energy impulse when the buffer hits the back of the buffer tube to be as low as possible for the least wear on the gun, as to stress the receiver less. I'm wondering how the weight of the buffer (basically a weight behind the bolt) affects this.

To simplify this for those unfamiliar with how the action works, imagine a sensor which graphs pressure over time, spring, weight, and force that dumps all its energy instantaneously (like a bullet going off) in line, like so:  

[S]  |\\|\\|\\|\\|  [W]  <-- F

(spring\^)

If the force is constant, the spring tension is constant, but we try two different weights, say 10oz and 20oz, which will cause the sensor to register a higher peak pressure/energy impulse, or will it be the same? Assume that the force is enough to cause the spring to fully compress and bottom out. The lighter weight will be moving faster when it strikes, but I'm wondering if there's something happening in the spring that causes it to be able to absorb more energy before it bottoms out. Intuitively it seems like the heavier weight would 'plow through' the spring tension more easily and be able to transfer more of its energy when it does bottom out. 

There may be other factors involved with changing the buffer weight but I think they're negligible for my purposes.

Ultimately, it's my belief that having a spring that allows the buffer to *just* barely bottom out with the full force of the round going off is going to give the least peak energy to the buffer tube. I'm wondering if the spring tension is the only factor, or if changing the buffer weight would affect this."

I hope someone can help me develop a formula I can plug into Excel to convert an apparent temperature to a more accurate estimate. For ease of calculation, I will assume that my hotplate (system) is a closed system, the plastic dish is not a barrier, and heat transfer is absolute. Details follow...

Details: I imaged cells in a 2.5 mL volume of a buffer (HEPES at pH 7.4) over a temperature range between ~1 C to ~60 C (~20 minutes).  I was looking for a reverse phase transition of components inside the cell (and was successful). The problem is that the temperature probe was broken and the only information I have is directly from the plate itself. 

I know that what I recorded is not the actual temperature in the solution. There is a lag time between what temperature the device states it is and when it actually reaches it. I am looking for a way to estimate the actual temperature by using the mass and heat capacity of water. 

I have two problems. First, I do not know how to calculate the temperature of water if heat capacity changes as temperature increases. I think I can simplify the problem by just keeping this value constant at 4.184 J/gK. Second, I am only familiar with calculating heat transfer by using CmΔT = CmΔT for two objects, but I do not know how to apply this to my problem since there is energy input into my hotplate and contact is limited to the bottom of the dish- no submersion into the liquid. 

Since I need to apply this to 500+ temperature datapoints on Excel, my approach would be to look at these data like a snapshots rather than a dynamic system. I want to use the mass of water and its heat capacity to come up an energy transfer rate formula for the system where I can transform apparent temperature to an estimate closer to the actual temperature in my 2.5 mL volume, but I don't know how.

What would be your approach to this problem? I thought I could figure something out by remembering what I learned from Physics, but apparently I didn't retain a lot of it. I will gild the first lucky bastard to post something I can use. I really don't want to go the physics department. It's a long shuttle ride away from the health sciences campus :-(

Is it worth being a high school physics/math teacher?,3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1491763540,True,"Hello,
I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in physics and theoretical mathematics. I only have one more semester to finish to receive my BS in physics and math and now start planning out what career I want to pursue in the future. My primary objective is to go into the field of photonics and work as an engineer, building and improving models for lasers and committing to doing research as a full time intern and transition to a full time employee while being a part time graduate student towards my Master Degree (or PhD if I am able to get into the PhD program, though I am not too sure how to degree system works). 

But if I am unable to get into the above career, my back up plan is going into being a high school teacher since I love to teach. I have always had a passion for helping younger individuals and educating  them however I can, and the subjects I love with all my heart is math and physics. I recently went to a physic career seminar and learned about the shortage of physics teachers in many areas in the US nation, as well as making a $90,000 a year entry salary while having a 10 year job security. But I have been reading a lot of stories about the negatives of being a high school physics/math teacher. 

I have been consulting many close friends, family, and teachers about the possibility of being a high school physics and math teacher and have received many responses both for and against that career path. May I asks the reddit community, preferrably opinions from current or retired teachers about their experience and the pros/cons of being a high school physics/math teacher."
Am I understanding the physics behind this relativity question correctly? (11th-12th grade),5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1491763543,True,"Hi. I'm in IB Physics and I'm doing self-study for relativity for our optional courses (choose one out of four, I thought relativity was the best to go with).

Anyways, our textbook isn't very good at explaining simultaneity and my teacher is doing astrophysics right now (he chooses that optional to teach because he doesn't know the others very well... but I haven't asked him on this yet). The question is on Einstein's thought experiment:

> Person S is standing on a platform watching a train go by. Person T is on the train directly in the middle. Person S watches the train get struck by lightning in the front and the back simultaneously. From person T's reference frame, explain why he does not see it simultaneously. 

My explanation: 

From S's reference frame, he sees the lightning strike both ends simultaneously. He will also observe that T will receive information of the events non-simultaneously, because he is moving *towards* the light from the front of the train and *away* from the light from the back of the train. S sees that T will see the strike from the front of the train first, and then from the back. The order of events cannot change in causally connected frames, so T must see the front lightning strike first in his own reference frame.

So I *kinda* think that it is correct, but I don't know if I'm understanding the full picture. Which is why I don't get one of the follow up questions:

> What is the distance of between the scorch marks for S and T on the train and on the platform? (The train is 100m long and is moving a .5c)

(I'm going from memory so excuse me if my numbers are off) I understand why T will see the scorch marks on the train as 100m apart, and why S sees them at 87m apart. S sees them 87m apart on the platform, which makes sense as well because in his frame the train is contracted. 

However, I don't understand why T sees the scorch marks on the platform to be 75m apart (according to the answers in the book). In his frame of reference, the train is 100m apart but the platform is contracted by gamma. To go to the answer in the book (75m), you have to take the 87m and contract it by gamma *again*. Why do you do it twice instead of once? I have a feeling it is because you are contracting what the distance is in the rest frame of the platform, but I don't understand why you wouldn't do it with the proper length of the train in its rest frame."

Question about Bose-Einstein condensation,1,2,False,False,False,Physics,1491826518,True,"So a system comprising an even number of fermions is a composite boson.

Is this because the ""approximation"" of a system of fermions as a composite boson is only valid at energies so low that the wavelength of the composite boson is much larger than its internal structure?

[;E = kT = p^2 /2m;] 

[; p = h/\lambda ;], 

so [;\lambda = h/\sqrt{2mkT};]

I get at T = 300K, [;\lambda = 4.0 pm;]. Which is surely smaller than an atom.

Problem i have with mass defect under nuclear reactions,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1491838015,True,"Hey people,

I'm currently doing an assignment about the triple-alpha-process and stumbled upon this contradiction in the stuff I've learned that i can't seem to figure out:

In the process, 3 He-4 cores are fused together to form a C-12 core. The reaction is as follows:

3*He4 -> C-12 + E

E being energy since the reaction is exothermic. But if one looks at the masses of the cores of either side one finds that the 4 Helium cores have a greater total mass. (m(He-4)=4.0026U, m(C-12)=12U => 3*4.0026>12).

It is also common knowledge, that the helium cores have a nuclear bond energy pr. nucleon than the carbon core (thus, the reaction is exothermic).

So my question is: How can 3 Helium cores have both greater total bond energy and greater total mass than the carbon core, if they are built from the same particles (6 protons and 6 neutrons)? "

How MOND theory deals with Gauss Law ?,10,5,False,False,False,Physics,1491851845,True,"MOND theory solves a lot of astrophysics problems without dark matter using only one new constant the universal acceleration a0 below which gravity field g become proportional to the inverse of distance r instead of the inverse of r^2. At first sight it looks like a simple patch but when I try to understand it a little more it seems that it don't agree with physics and even don't agree with math...

1) Ostrogradski divergence theorem is a mathematical theorem telling that ""the outward flux of a vector field through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence over the region inside the surface"" applied to gravity it gives in very straight forward way the Gauss Law saying that gravity is proportional to r^-2. How MOND theory bypass this law ?

2) In the simplest MOND solution, for a << a0, g = sqrt (G*M*a0/r). Which means that superposition principle don't apply anymore to gravity. g(2M) is not equal to 2*g(M). The gravitational field of a galaxy is not the sum of the gravitational field of its star ! How could it be ?"

How far is too far when devoting my life to physics?,19,6,False,False,False,Physics,1491897693,True,"Upon taking three years to find myself and work out my mental setbacks, I've ardently come to the conclusion that I need to further our understanding of existence and anything outside of it. However, the problem arises when it comes down to personal identity and passion for my hobbies.

To reach my full potential, I feel I need to cut out most activities unnecessary to my academic aspirations. Nowadays I'm quite hard-pressed and poor and can't afford the aggregate of my extended education, social life, and expensive (plus time-consuming) hobbies of music and computer science. Thus, I'm at a predicament of time/life management.

[TLDR] From your experience, have you ever felt the need to purge your life of transitory desires (albeit enjoyable) to focus on your studies? What has been worth the sacrifice? And perhaps most importantly, have your changes/growths and sacrifices negatively affected your lifelong personal identity and/or mental health?

I'm on my way to my 22nd birthday. I'm quite susceptible to depression, anxiety, and psychosis, but recent medication has me back on track and more ambitious than ever. Due to anxiety, I might not check or reply to some comments for a bit. I apologize, but internet people can be ruthless and I don't handle it well. I was wasteful with my earlier youth and have become rather diverted from academia, though I truly believe if I put in enough time and effort that I can join the ranks of intellectuals making headway in understanding the true nature and elementary engineering of the universe. As it stands, my primary setbacks are my finances and the fear of loss of welfare from giving up personal identity (albeit faulty and peripheral) in pursuit of undiluted knowledge and problem-solving."

Why do electrons jump from ice crystals to amorphous ice hail when snow and hail collide in thunderclouds?,12,4,False,False,False,Physics,1491907020,True,"Background: I was reading up on the causes of lightning, and learned that the charge is caused by collisions between snow crystals, which tend to rise with an updraft, and hail, which tends to hover or fall in the updraft. As the snow continues to rise above the hail, it carries its positive charge up high, whilst the corresponding negative charge remains low on the hail that is too aerodynamic to ride the updraft.

So my question is, why do the electrons jump from the snow to the hail in the collisions, and not the other way around? What causes this asymmetry?

Does it have anything to do with the snow crystals breaking upon impact due to their fragility? Do the jumps only happen when the hail breaks a snow crystal, or even if the snow crystal survives the impact undamaged?

Or perhaps is the asymmetry due to the difference in structure between snow ice and hail ice, with snow being a crystal and hail being amorphous?"

Options for Graduate Classes for Next Semester,5,1,False,False,False,Physics,1491946432,True,"Yo, I'm a physics and math undergraduate, and next semester I was on track to take the QFT graduate course in physics and the Algebraic Topology graduate course in mathematics.  That being said, they scheduled those classes at the same time, so I have to pick between one or the other.  

I'm conflicted because most of my friends/ people I can work with are taking algebraic topology (so that I'll have several people to collaborate with and won't be working alone) and I enjoy learning the more mathematical sides of physics (so I feel a healthy mix of mathematics and physics is important), but I feel that QFT will be more applicable to my applications for graduate programs (that I'll be starting this summer/ next semester).  

So my question is, if I want to do graduate school in theoretical physics, should I focus on QFT or more math related courses?

Time Dilation,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1491951916,True,"Where ever you are on the planet Earth Gravity acts upon you. Governing how much you weigh and how much time passes for you this is effected by the mass of the earth around you, the sun, moon and all the bodies in between. The amount of matter around affects the flow of time as well as the speed at which the matter is moving, ie as the equator is further away from the center of the earth than the poles it should have less gravity affecting it, therefore time should pass quicker compared to, for arguments sake, the north and south poles. But due to the rotation of the earth speeding up the flow of time, this is canceled out and all the clocks on earth run at the same rate. The most famous example of time dilation is in a black hole where time is slowed to the point of an almost complete stop. My question is, if time runs slowly on heavier mass objects as well as slower moving objects, how much time difference is the between here and mars as it is further away from the biggest mass in the solar system? And also if bigger mass' slow down the flow of time that would mean that there would be logicaly universe' ""time zones"" which are different in each planet/solar system/ galaxy that a traveler would find themselves in.

What is the picture of our universe painted by modern science? Obviously every individual mind will create its own idiosyncratic picture, but what are the most common basic principles and conceptions people are using to architect their pictures? If for example you contracted a tabla rasa of average intelligence and gave it an average western education up to completing high school, and then had them read every popular science book on the market, what picture of their universe and their position within it would they be most likely to come away with?

An approximation: There was a “big bang”; in one moment, seemingly out of nothing, an infinitesimal volume of space somehow containing all the energy and matter that has ever existed or will ever exist exploded into existence out of nothingness. How or why this happened no one knows. There is no scientific theory explaining either the origin or the first few moments of the big bang; the big bang happened a t = 0 and science has nothing sensible to say about our universe until some few millionths or billionths of a second later. This big bang has all the trademarks of a miracle; it’s not only unexplained, it also strikes the mind as utterly inexplicable, baffling, impossible. Unless of course you don’t consider yourself and all the universe around you suddenly exploding into existence out nothingness miraculous. In short, why did the big bang bang? It just did. Not very satisfying to a curious mind but there you go.

What exactly came into existence in the big bang? The answer appears to reduce to essentially just one thing; energy. Thanks to Albert Einstein we know that all matter is in fact energy via E = mc2, and also thanks to A.E. we know that the space-time of the universe is defined and shaped by the configuration of all the energy of the universe. According to modern science very physical object that exists is composed of energy and energy appears to be the fundamental, basic constituent of this universe, and energy appears to be nothing but energy, made of energy, basic, primary, not explained in terms of anything other than energy itself. 

It’s believed that when all this energy was created it was in a very special configuration of extremely “low entropy”, or in other words, was in a very “ordered” or “special” configuration. Since the beginning of time entropy has 
always been increasing; the configuration of all the energy in the universe has been becoming more “disordered”, less “special” ever since the big bang. This continuous increase of entropy or disorder is believed to be an absolutely fundamental property of our universe, so much so that it is considered a physical law. This law is known as the “Second Law of Thermodynamics” and it is believed that this law, this continuous flow of the configuration of the universe from ordered to disordered, is what has given rise to the flow and direction of time ever since the big bang, and continues to do so now, and will continue to do so until the end of the universe in what’s known as the “heat death of the universe”.

Before I talk about the heat death - it’s not good news - I want to consider the position, physical and psychological, of life and particularly humanity in the middle of all this. It’s believed all the energy created in the big bang was and remains completely devoid of consciousness, that none of it, not a Joule, is possessed of any consciousness whatsoever; it’s all very energetic but all very dead, lifeless, spiritless, soulless. During its descent into disorder the configuration of all the energy has changed very much. Confining ourselves to the atomic scale, the energy first separated into light and particles, themselves both made of energy. The light sometimes looks like waves and sometimes like particles called photons, and similarly the particles sometimes look like particles and sometimes like waves. There are very many types of particles but I want to concentrate on protons, neutrons and electrons, since all terrestrial life can be thought of as being built out of these three particles along with some quantity of energy. And to reiterate, all the PNEs are themselves made of energy, and so it follows that you are also comprised of nothing but energy.

Like all the basic constituents of the universe, all the PNEs are believed to be completely devoid of any consciousness, which immediately presents us with a very obvious contradiction; If a human, specifically their brain, is comprised entirely of things that themselves are possessed of absolutely no consciousness, how then is the human conscious? Or at least, if blah blah blah, how then does their very persistent and consistent and convincing sensation of being conscious arise? This is what’s known as the “hard problem of consciousness”. 
 (At least for most people it presents a contradiction; some people have apparently managed to convince themselves that consciousness is an illusion, that they themselves aren’t in fact conscious!!! You have to imagine they came to this conclusion through their consciousnesses. If this theory isn’t abjectly stupid, it’s a dead end. It’s like answering the question “What is the universe?” with “The universe doesn’t exist.”)


The current scientific answer to this problem is a big fat “?”, “no idea”. You might think “But I’ve seen pictures of scans of brains lighting up as the owner is consciously thinking about something or other.” Yes, but all those scans are only pictures of the energy of the brain, pictures of the parts of the brain that have the most neurons firing when the test subject has certain conscious experiences.  ( And neurons are also thought to be individually devoid of consciousness, made up as they are of non-conscious PNEs.) ( And as far as the scientists know the consciousness could be being generated around the parts of the brain that don’t light up, in which case their scans of the brain would in fact be negatives, though this doesn’t seem very likely) The only things being measured in scans of brains are physical phenomena like energy or electric potential and currently consciousness does not figure as a physical phenomena within physics. The pictures of the energy of the brain being measured is then correlated with the test subject’s subjective testimony as to what conscious experiences they were having during the scanning process, or with the scientist’s subjective inference as to the test subject’s conscious experiences during the scanning process. Here we see subjectivity creeping into the scientific picture despite scientists’ constant repetition that science is purely objective. It also creeps in through Quantum Mechanics and Alan Turing’s Turing test. In fact, it creeps in whenever consciousness is at all a part of the picture being considered.

Scientists hope to solve this hard problem by describing the configuration of neurons in the brain in terms of networks, and collections and hierarchies of networks, and with extensive use of analogy with computers such that consciousness arises as what they call an “emergent” property. In short, emergent consciousness is the idea that if a sufficiently large number of these non-conscious constituents, non-conscious PNEs making non-conscious neurons, are arranged in a sufficiently complex, interconnected configuration, consciousness suddenly, somehow happens in and around them. It is thought that these complex neural configurations will be describable following the known theories and laws of physics, and employing the known constituents of the universe; energy, matter, space and time. 

I’m going to assume you are conscious and understand what it is like to experience consciousness, that you know, for example, what it’s like to feel things like happiness and pain and love. Can you imagine some string of equations involving all these, by definition, non-conscious things like energy and PNEs, giving any meaningful, satisfactory explanation of what it is to consciously experience these feelings? Even if the string of equations was very long or beautiful, put together by the best and brightest minds, with lots of verbal and metaphorical explanation, I can’t. But maybe, who knows? But as of today science has not provided that explanation or string of equations. There is currently no theory as to how large numbers of non-conscious things can be arranged to give rise to our conscious experiences. What there is however, is a very many analogies between brains and computers where, and very importantly you’d imagine, the computers aren’t thought to be conscious in the first place! This hard problem remains a gap in the current scientific picture of the universe that neuroscientists are working to solve.

Taken as a whole what does all the above summary of modern science say about spirituality? Well, if you’re truly scientific it says nothing about spirituality at all, however, one thing modern scientists are not, is scientific. And science is, at least in part, an attempt to understand the universe and our experiences within it, so it’s natural that we might try to draw some spiritual conclusions from the scientific picture. So, speaking very generally, what spiritual conclusions have been drawn?

There is no God. ( I know a lot of scientists believe in God but I’m only examining what I believe to be the prevailing beliefs.)
There are no such things as souls.
There are no such things as an afterlife or reincarnation.
The universe at large in no way cares about us, is in fact incapable of caring, and doesn’t even know we exist because it doesn’t “know” anything at all.
Moral relativism; the four conclusions above leave no possibility for any absolute morality or objective definition of good or bad. The notions of good and bad that we do have are ultimately completely arbitrary, contingent on the chaotic and chance biological and cultural history of humanity.

This is nihilism, or at least as long as I believed the universe was this way I was a nihilist and thought that life was fundamentally meaningless.

Now let's look at the reasoning behind these conclusions: 

There is no scientific reason that so many scientist have concluded that there is no God. There is no experiment yet conceived of that provides any evidence whatsoever as to whether there is or is not a God; all empirical evidence so far collected about the universe is equally compatible with both God existing and not existing. The large scale rejection of God by scientists looks to have much more to do with historical and psychological and political reasoning as opposed to objective philosophical.  One very interesting question is how different scientists’ philosophical conclusions might have been under different cultural and sociological conditions; had science developed in world free of war and poverty, where people really took care of one another and lived truly happy spiritual lives, how much more likely would a scientist be to conclude that there was some benevolent influence guiding the universe?  The question as to whether there is or is not a God depends very much on the conceptions of the universe and God that are being employed and requires a separate, dedicated treatment, but as one example; if God exists outside of our physical universe and is not physically connected to our universe, interacts with our universe in some non-physical way or doesn’t interact with our universe at all, then science as it is could never offer any evidence for either God or no God. As I say it depends very much on your conception of God and there are very many, very varied such conceptions.
The human body and brain have both been dissected in thousands of different ways whilst both alive and once dead, and no evidence of a soul has been found anywhere.
Again, no physical evidence, and given that souls aren’t believed to exist there is nothing to go to heaven or to be reincarnated in the first place.
The universe at large is not conscious so obviously it can’t care about anything. 
It’s difficult to arrive at any other logical conclusion once you accept the previous four conclusions.

So, according to science, what’s your fate as a human being? Well, the universe is a giant clockwork or Rube Goldberg machine made out of non-conscious energy, the end result of which is a state of maximum entropy or maximum disorder. All life will be completely and utterly annihilated, but not only that, there will also be absolutely no way to extract any information at all from this final state. Not even the mightiest of physicists, if they could observe this final state would be able to figure out what had taken place during its past.
Yourself and absolutely everything that has ever lived or happened will be gone without trace, utterly annihilated. It will be equivalent to you never having existed. You will never, ever again, during an eternity, during an infinite number of years, ever feel or think or see or taste or kiss or remember anything ever again. You, your body and what you point at within yourself with the word “soul”, will be infinitely annihilated. Everyone you ever loved, your mom and dad, your soulmate, your kids, will all be infinitely annihilated, no memory or trace left of your lives together or how you loved each other, all annihilated.

I don’t know if souls exist or not but I do believe that I feel as if I have a soul; I feel I experience beauty and sadness and joy and fear as if I have a soul, and I feel as if I love a number of people, including myself (and n > 1 ), as if I have a soul, thus the current scientific picture of the universe happens to be the saddest picture of the universe I can conceive of and I think it contributes significantly to all the anxiety and soul sickness and nihilism everywhere. This picture has been depressing, not to mention terrifying, the shit out of me for over twenty years but I’m much happier now that I find some alternative pictures at least as plausible.


Part2

In light of the summary of modern science in part 1., what are the most fundamental, or a priori postulates, or to use some religious terminology, what are the Commandments of modern science, the beliefs held so deeply as to never be questioned? We might say; 
         1. The universe was created in a big bang, of before this event, nothing is known. 
         2. Space-time and energy were created in this big bang and this space and energy evolve from one momentary configuration to the next in absolute accordance with the physical laws of the universe that scientists have adduced through experiment and theory.
           3. The energy created in the Big Bang is not possessed of any consciousness whatsoever; no photon, proton, neutron or electron, or quark, or string, or Joule of energy is conscious in any way.
        4. Mathematics can be used to construct models of the universe that are more or less accurate (many are astoundingly accurate) and these models can be used to make predictions of future states of the universe and to describe past states of the universe. Knowledge or exploration of pure mathematics can be used as a guide when constructing these mathematical models. 
        5. Scientific inquiry is to follow the now well known scientific method which amongst other things mandates that the scientists’ subjectivity, or anyone else’s, cannot in any way be included or inform the picture or model of the universe being constructed. The only admissible evidence for a scientific theory is objective, empirical evidence. No anecdotal or subjective evidence.

The above seem to me a reasonable attempt to list the most fundamental postulates of modern science. My theory requires only one major change to these postulates, a change that allows for the construction of scientific theories of good and God and which facilitates the resolution of a few contradictions implied by the other postulates. I should say that this theory is absolutely not original, it's conventionally known as panpsychism. The Holy Geeta propounds one possible scientific construction of a conscious universe which I've drawn inspiration from if not blatantly ripped off. Edgar Allan Poe also propounds a theory of a panpsychic universe in his long poem Eureka, and the physicist David Bohm wrote a theory of a conscious universe in his book “The Implicate Order”, western science has just never taken such theories seriously.

In my theory the third postulate becomes:

3. All the energy existent in our universe is, and always has been, and always will be, conscious.

I believe and hope to show that this postulate is completely compatible with all the scientific theory and evidence thus far accumulated by humanity. Working with this new postulate allows very many (an infinity in fact) of new scientific theories of the universe to be constructed, including plausible scientific theories of good and God and reincarnation amongst other things. Let me be very clear however, that what I'm proposing is not a proof of anything, it is simply another theory of how the universe might be, based on all the scientific evidence  thus far accumulated. 

I intend to outline as simply as I can the simplest scientific theory of a conscious universe that I have thought of to date, but first I want to quickly defend my new postulate from the most obvious objections I imagine people having to it; “So, you're saying that things like electrons and photons and muons are conscious, alive? But that's absurd and there's no evidence for it.” These two objections are both completely correct; there is no direct evidence for things like muons being conscious but there is also no direct evidence that things like muons are not conscious, in fact, there is no direct, objective evidence of anyone or anything at all being conscious. As I said earlier, scans of conscious brains are only measures of conventional physical quantities like energy and electric potential for example, and consciousness does not yet figure in, and is not yet accounted for by science. The only way to directly measure consciousness is to experience it, to be, at least in part, the consciousness you’re measuring. The only consciousness I'm completely sure of is my own and even that consciousness I can doubt, though only through thought experiments which is basically a restatement of Descartes’ cogito. 

I believe my family and friends and everyone else I know is conscious based only on Turing tests, that is, I have observed and interacted with other humans and creatures and they have persuaded my intuition that they are conscious. Of course I don't mean that I'm carrying out formal Turing tests with my friends and family, I just mean that I'm convinced of  other consciousnesses by the same logic employed in a Turing test; I interact with what may or may not be a conscious entity until I'm convinced that it’s either conscious or not conscious. For as long as I can remember simply looking at an awake human has convinced me implicitly that they are conscious.

All this serves to highlight one of the contradictions of modern science; scientists are very proud of how their method only admits of objective, non-subjective, non anecdotal evidence and yet their scientific test for consciousness, the Turing test, relies entirely on the subjective impressions, and intuition, and anecdotal evidence of the human questioning the test subject. The Turing test is pure intuitionism (as is all human knowledge) and is absolutely in violation of the scientific method, but anywhere consciousness comes up science is a shambles.

As for my new postulate being absurd, well, yeah, it is absolutely absurd, but all the galaxies and black holes and solar systems, and length contraction and time dilation and quantum magic, and the Earth and humanity and politics and love and laughter, all exploding out of a singularity is absurd, it’s all absurd, good or bad, existence is absurd. You and all your personality, all the crazy things you’ve felt and thought and loved and laughed at somehow floating around a wet blob of non-conscious neurons made of non-conscious, dead protons, neutrons and electrons is absurd. Look at everything you're trying to explain; it's absurd, mind-boggling, any explanation is going to have to be somewhat absurd and mind-boggling. 

In the hopes of a useful analogy let's examine the status of energy in modern science. There are different forms of energy and energy can be converted from one form (kinetic for example) to another (potential for example) through various physical processes. Also, energy is conserved, or in other words, it can be neither created nor destroyed. This means that when some energy in one form is converted into a different form or forms, none of the energy at all is lost. For example you could invest a stone with some potential energy by lifting it away from the surface of the earth and then convert all that potential energy into kinetic energy by letting the stone fall to the Earth. On colliding with the Earth the kinetic energy of the stone will be converted into heat energy of the stone, the ground and the surrounding air. A photon, light energy, can be absorbed by a molecule and converted into some mass energy as a part of the molecule. Some of the energy of certain atomic nuclei is converted into a gamma ray, light energy, as a part of radioactive decay. Nuclear bombs work via the conversion of some of the bombs mass energy into light energy.

So, if we were to speak about the universe in the absolutely simplest terms, we could say that it is space filled with various forms of energy, the configuration of the various forms of energy informing the shape of, if not creating, the space via general relativity. Sometimes the energy is light and sometimes it “curls up” into matter and when it does it can no longer travel at the speed of light; the curling up forms mass and slows the energy down. 

Also, energy is considered fundamental, it isn't explained in terms of anything else. It's different forms can be described but energy is just energy. Energy simply exists and is capable of many different forms. Light is, or is made of energy, particles are made of energy, quarks are made of energy, strings are made of energy. Imagine if we decided energy was an “emergent” property, we could spend a lot of time trying to work out the basic constituents of energy and the mechanism by which it emerges.  


Here we can see that science is much more a description of the universe and not an explanation of it, and that basically we're just describing the different forms that energy can take, but we can't say why the forms it does take manifest as they do. At some point the universe just has to be the way it is. It exists so it has to be some way and it can't be all ways. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second, why not 187000 miles per second? Well, because the universe has to be some way and it can't be no way because it exists. You might say it's 186,000 miles per second because of the ratio of such and such, but that simply defers the question to why are such and such, such that their ratio sets the speed of light at 186,000 miles per second and not 187,000 miles per second, say. at some point explanation has to end and the universe just is what it is.

As an example let’s think of a typical red brick. Scientists could describe the brick in atomic detail, measure the position and energies of every atom making up the brick, it's exact dimensions to an atom, it's blackbody spectrum, the force  required to crack or break the brick etc, etc. But what science can't say is why all this energy, configured in this way, manifests in all the ways it actually manifests, why that configuration of energy manifests that shade of red and not another, why it feels just the way it does and not some other way. In another universe the very same configuration of energy might manifest in a different way, with a different shade of red or as soft or wet for example.

Another example; why is gravity attractive? Mass could just as well repel mass. Again, science might provide some explanation as to why gravitation is attractive, but again, given that explanation you can simply ask “but why does the universe manifest as it does in your explanation?”.

In essence my theory is this; everything is made of energy and energy is not made of anything but energy, energy is fundamental. I say that along with all the hitherto observed properties of energy is consciousness; energy is conscious, consciousness is energy. There are many different forms or types of consciousness; each different configuration of energy gives rise to, or corresponds to, or simply is a different conscious state. Changes in a configuration of energy change, however slightly, the consciousness of the energy.

Also, consciousness like, or as energy is a ranged phenomena; an electron isolated by distance from a proton will manifest a different consciousness than an electron in a hydrogen atom, in close, cloudy, quantum contact with a proton.

Also, I believe consciousness is additive; an electron and proton when separate possess separate consciousnesses (separateness defined in the same way physical separateness is defined in quantum mechanics with wave packets and such) but can come together to form a new, different consciousness as a hydrogen atom. Quantum discontinuities might come with discontinuous transitions between different conscious states.

This does mean that things like bricks and even electrons and muons are conscious, which I appreciate is difficult to accept, but it can become easier to accept once you consider how different a brick's consciousness is likely to be. It might be many separate consciousnesses, a consciousness around each atom, or one large, localised consciousness, or some type of consciousness in between. And a brick’s consciousness might be (is likely to be) very limited compared to your own, might be nothing but one constant physical sensation of its own warmth or of the pressure forces it's experiencing, for example. It might have essentially the same conscious experience all day, everyday. I definitely don't mean to say that bricks have emotions or feelings we’d recognise, or have personalities, or can love, simply that they are, like all energy, in some way or another, conscious. Another thing to bear in mind is that until very recently plants were not believed to be conscious but now, thanks to sensitive and imaginative observation and theory, plants are being increasingly discovered to be conscious. I believe are notions of what in the universe is conscious will expand to include the whole universe.

What it does mean is that you are having the conscious experience you're now having due to the configuration of all the energy making you up. In the same way the exact configuration of every atom in a red brick manifests as a red brick, the exact configuration of energy that makes you, manifests as both your physical and conscious self. I have a lamina (animal) theory of consciousness that explains in more detail how this might work in terrestrial life.

This theory does not require any of our current scientific knowledge or theory to be changed or thrown out, but simply says that all the scientific theory currently accepted is in fact an approximation to our universe where C, consciousness, has been set to zero.  The simplest way to include consciousness is to say that all energy and therefore all matter is in fact conscious, or is consciousness, and the simplest relation is E = C. This has some huge implications.

Let me offer some reinterpretations of the results of some famous quantum mechanical experiments in the hope of making this all more plausible to you. First, muon decay:
Experiments can be done measuring how long it takes for a falling muon to decay. The muons all decay within some measurable length of time, but exactly how long each muon takes before decaying is thought to be inherently random or probabilistic.  The time a muon takes to decay will always be around some average length, but exactly when any given muon is going to decay is unknowable.  I claim that the decay of muons isn't actually probabilistic but simply appears probabilistic, that probabilism is simply one possible interpretation. I claim it’s as least as plausible that muon decay is in fact a display of the individual consciousnesses of muons consciously, intuitively willing themselves to decay. When I use words like “will” and “intuition” I’m inevitably using them somewhat poetically, I don’t mean to imply a human will or intuition but something inevitably very alien, possibly much more dark and limited. Maybe the willing to decay is based on the muon’s interaction with, or perception of the universe around it before it wills itself to decay.  As scientists we can only observe as sensitively as possible, and then speculate as intelligently as possible, based on our observations. Muons being possessed of some very simple consciousness that is capable of (and maybe of not much else) willing the moment of its own decay for whatever reasons or under whatever influences, would give exactly the same experimental results given by non-conscious muons that are somehow decaying probabilistically. 

Why do the muons all decay around some average time?  Well, because they're a species, very similar constructions, or foldings, or convolutions of the basic constituent of our universe, conscious energy, and as such they perceive and experience the universe in very similar ways and perceive similar sets of possible alternative behaviors when in similar physical situations. It’s worth mentioning that the 2.2 microseconds it takes for a muon to decay, might be experienced by the muon in such a way that the muon’s experience of the 2.2 microseconds is most similar to how a human would experience some much longer time, an example of the possible relativity of perceived time.

Next the two slit experiment. Again, the pattern of electrons created in the two slit experiment is thought to be the result of non-conscious electrons arriving at random points on the screen but in such a way as to statistically crowd in the pattern of brighter and darker fringes the experiment is famous for. My theory is that the wave function of the electron is also a measure or graph of the electron’s perception of the universe around it. The slits that cause the electron’s wave function to interfere with itself are in effect casting a shadow or patches of darkness in the electron’s perception of the universe ahead of it, and the electrons naturally head into regions of the universe that they can perceive, they can't or don't want to head into imperceptible regions of the universe. The exact spot on the screen the electron arrives at may be a decision involving the consciousness of the electron, or the consciousness of the screen, or both, or the consciousness of the whole system.

If the ratio of a bat’s size and the wavelength of the sound waves it uses to echolocate fell within a certain range (a range I imagine nature would try to avoid) then these bats might experience a similar blindness when echolocating through appropriately sized slit like architecture, and might pass through the slits and arrange themselves on branches behind the slits in a pattern similar to the bright and dark fringes seen in the two slit experiment. 

Why does the introduction of a camera observing which slit each electron passes through destroy the interference pattern? My theory is that similar physical constructions give rise to similar conscious experiences, so the camera is conscious in a way somewhat comparable to your own visual consciousness (just your visual consciousness, not all of your human consciousness.) Of course the consciousness is likely to be exceedingly different to our own, but it seems reasonable,at least within the context of my theory, to suppose that a camera connected to a computer, while measuring the electrons, might somewhere within itself be conscious of some visual perception of the pictures it was taking or the phenomena it was measuring. The consciousness of the camera might interact with the perceptions of the electron. The electron might be compelled, or choose to interact with or to undergo measurement by the camera - computer, eye - brain consciousness of the system. Of course what conscious experiences either the electron or camera experience can only be speculated upon and never known, at least not without somehow sharing their experiences. 

If the inherent mysteriousness of the consciousness of these simple physical objects troubles your credulity, bear in mind that the only reason you're convinced anyone aside from yourself is conscious is based on similar speculative theories of their consciousness in conjunction with observation of their behavior. You can never directly measure, or experience, or confirm the existence of any consciousness except your own. Given this fact it follows that there are no experiments that can be performed to directly confirm my theory, but there are also no experiments that can be performed to directly confirm the existence of any consciousness, including human consciousness. I contend that all scientific experiments that have been performed to date are just as compatible with my theory as with the current non-conscious theory of the universe and that my theory, while at first difficult to accept, makes much more sense of the universe and especially the question of consciousness. 

It's possible however, that statistical analysis of phenomena once thought to be devoid of consciousness might allow for compelling analogy with certain types of behavior believed to be directed by consciousness. 

Accepting my theory sheds light on a number of issues in modern science;

The origin of life: very simple; it’s all life, always has been.

Evolution and it’s apparent creativity: Evolution has in fact been conscious Lamarckism in disguise as Darwinism. As life has evolved so has consciousness evolved and expanded. Expanded consciousness has allowed for the perception and willing of novel future alternatives and possibilities. Also, different forms of consciousness are pleased, for example, by different perceptions, so it is the conscious aesthetic sense of the female peacock that, at least in part, paints the tail feathers of the male.

A.I.: Doesn’t exist yet at all. A chess computer for example, is always looking at a quantity of possible future moves and by human designed algorithm picking the move that the algorithm calculates as most advantageous. And it can do this very quickly. Would you consider yourself good at chess or intelligent if you were able to really quickly check a big book for the best next move? Look at the example given on page 46 of Roger Penrose’s “Shadows of the Mind”; no intelligence whatsoever. These computers can’t check their own algorithms, have no idea what chess is. A.I. scientists have yet to produce a single example of anything that even resembles true intelligence. The only intelligent things humans have created to date are children.

Cosmology and Spirituality: Here my theory really opens up vast new realms of philosophical exploration. The Holy Geeta contains a completely scientific theory of a conscious, fractal universe that is compatible with the God of the Tanakh and Bible and Quran (which is the one and the same God by the way) and atheism. In the Holy Geeta the construction of souls and the process of reincarnation are accounted for in a theory that is scientific once you allow for intrinsic consciousness. Possible theories of God (and different kinds of gods) are also constructible. I hope to write up some of these theories soon.

Need help for 30-year old Physics questions.,24,0,False,False,False,Physics,1492219516,True,"Hello folks,

I have several questions since my college day and they have been in my mind for a long time.  I asked them once a while when I ran into some Physics teachers but they could not really answer my questions.

Perhaps some of you could and/or point me to the Physics authorities for me to summit my questions.  I do have my own answer to those questions but I assume my answers are wrong.

(Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers. Voltaire.)

-----------
Question #1:
Imagine a perfectly round, solid earth with a tube drilled through the center.  If you drop an object into the tube, eventually the object will settle at the center of the earth.  Apparently, gravity seems to cancel itself out.

A.  Will the object experience time dilation or not?

Imagine a perfectly round, solid earth with a hollow round chamber at the center.  Inside this chamber, gravity will cancel each other out (this in analyzed and agreed by the Physics folks).

B.  Will the object experience time dilation or not?  If it does not, is there any gravity field or space warping going through an object if it is at a side of the hollow chamber?

My own answer to the questions 1.A and 1.B might explain the spin rate of the galaxy.  (Basically, there is no need for the dark matter halo.)

Question 2 is in a next reply."

I have a good idea of how time-domain OCT works but I'm having a hard time grasping how fourier-domain OCT works. From what I understand, with time domain OCT you use a low-coherence light source to do a number of scans at a short length  for a full axial scan. You have to move the reference mirror as you scan into the sample.

With Fourier-domain OCT, you can get a full axial scan right away without moving the reference mirror. Please explain to me in relatively simple terms how this is done."

Hey /r/Physics , I'm a student from Math PhD and was tasked by my supervisor to give a report on Lieb-Thirring inequalities and was given the Quantum Stability textbook by Lieb-Seiringer.

However, while going through the book over Easter I'm stuck in the proof for ""Admissable One-Body Density Matrices for Fermions"". Or rather, I don't think I know what the proof is trying to tell me. Since it's Easter break and no one except me is in the office, I thought I'd ask reddit instead hahas

[Here is the part where I'm not cleared.
](http://imgur.com/rNpDqW9)

Where is the iteration on? What is the term R^M_j? As well as \epsilon_k? Both terms are not mentioned anywhere in the proof and seems to me they are defined as ""some iteration"", which is not satisfactory for my understanding.

It got worst then they let M into infinity and somehow R^M_j becomes 'some remainder' that has zero value in limit. waaaaaat 

Would appreciate if someone could construct a 2nd iteration maybe it's more clear to me :(

**studying physics:**  

1. Do I need to be scared of the amount of math? I was average in math in high school, but very good in physics and other sciences.

I'm doing some research about careers in physics and I thought I might find some genuine physicists here in this subreddit. I'm ONLY thinking about studying physics as profession, but not before I ask some crucial questions.

• How is the typical work day of a physicist?

• How is it in terms of salary?

• How do physicists take on problems?

• How do physicists think?

• What are potential obstacles a person studying physics might come across 

• How does one become a successful physicist?

And anything that might be of importance to state would really help me a lot. Thanks!

Is cfd like openfoam used in other realms of physics?,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1492492775,True,"Hey guys and gals,

In my 4th year I got interested in cfd while doing a flat plate case. Fast forward to after grad and while I am looking for a job(Still looking :( ) I have been playing with Linux and open foam. I looked into astrophysics and plasma physics and such as they interest me to. So many visualization of these simulation video has the word cfd in them. So is openfoam codes used in these realms of physics (from HE physics to astrophysics and maybe quantum)? I have seen fluent used to model particle tracking with quantum fluid transport phenomenon, there was this plasmaFoam paper which had a solver for low temperature plasma physics, and there some codes (behind a pay wall for the report) that deal with astrophysics as well. So I'm quite curious? If so that be something interesting to get into 🙏"

A question about theoretical quantum physics experiment (could require some specialist).,12,3,False,False,False,Physics,1492541289,True,"Hello, this is my first post here, so I wanted to say hi to everyone, my name is Matt, I am interested in popular physics, I am not someone very well educated in this topic, and thus I have a question.

The question I have spans two things: Bose–Einstein condensate and double slit experiment - combined.

Here's the theoretical set-up. We know that light slows down in Bose–Einstein condensate to few km/h, what if we 'dip' the whole double slit experiment in Bose–Einstein condensate [or just area of the actual slit]? What I am asking, and thinking, if light slows down that much, we would be able to record it's path as it goes through the slits. That way [in my mind] we would be able to slow things enough to actually see quantum wave of probability as the light travels along. Does anyone know if that would work? Would we be able to learn anything new with this?

I am aware that it requires incredible well defined parameters to create and sustain Bose–Einstein condensate, and that we cannot create much of it, that's why it is more of theoretical question, I don't think it is possible to actually do it as of now. That being said, we can do this as a 'thought experiment'. What are your thoughts? Am I stupid even asking? My knowledge is limited in this field, so excuse me if I made horrendous error somewhere.

Thank you in advance, and cheers!"

Does Gravity really affect Light?,82,19,False,False,False,Physics,1492549930,True,"This may be a silly question, though it may not.

We know Gravity affects mass...

And we know photons have no mass...

The typical retort to this question seems to be: Yes of course, see Gravitational Lensing etc. But if light rays always move along geodesics, then they only *appear* to be bending around massive objects - when they're actually traveling along straight lines in 4D. So am I crazy or what?

...

UPDATE: Thank-you all for the feedback.

I've come to the conclusion that the question itself is a bit arbitrary. That's because it hinges on a distinction between what *appears* to happen and what *really* happens. This distinction is evidently superficial - a consequence of whatever geometry.

That said, GR uses a very specific geometry, which generalizes the notion of a ""straight line"" as the path followed by a particle experiencing no non-gravitational Forces (a relativistically invariant version of Newton's First Law - if I understand it correctly).

However, the nature of this 'curvature' is still a riddle for me. I remain unsatisfied with another question I came to ask, about whether or not this geometry affects massive and massless particles differently. While I have come to understand that both kinds of particles follow Geodesics of their own, I can't see how these Geodesic are 'of the same sort'.

This is because the paths traced out by Light are 'null curves' which define the '[causal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_structure)' of the Lorentzian Manifold underlying the geometry of GR. 'Time-like' curves on the other hand are worldlines traced out by massive particles, and do not themselves define the causal structure in at all the same way. 

I realize my understanding here is lackluster, but I'm still quite curious. "

How much isolation is required to construct a Shrodinger's box?,19,0,False,False,False,Physics,1492704136,True,"For example, if a robot were to look into Shrodinger's box, the wave function would collapse relative to the robot. However, if the robot never told anyone about what it saw and what it saw makes no discernible difference to anything except to the robot, would the wave function collapse relative to everything outside the box-robot system? The system would essentially become just a more complex and larger Shrodinger's box.

What if the box was a 2 variable system and the robot only told us the boolean operation AND of the two variables. Would that only partially collapse the wave function?


I am trying to develop a theory of consciousness rooted in physics. My hypothesis is that a good description of the quantitative level of consciousness that an entity (a bounding box around a chunk of matter) experiences is proportional to the number of wave functions that the entity has collapsed relative to itself. A more conscious entity would have peered into a larger number of Shrodinger's boxes.

How sensitive is quantum superposition to collapsing? What is the wave function with the closest center of mass probability to me? Surely light from our sun that hits a far off planet and gets absorbed by the planet and is transformed into heat, surely the wave function that describes that photon has not collapsed relative to us!

Matter exploding apart?,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1492731342,True,"Years ago, I was a first year physics student, at a talk by Eric Cornell shortly after he had won the Nobel Prize for his work on the Bose–Einstein condensate.  At the talk, he referenced the idea that ""according to physics"" all matter should be exploding apart.  He told the story of working on a proof for days and sleepless nights, trying to solve this problem.  After some time, he thought he had found the solution, and excitedly showed it to all his grad students.  One of them pointed out that in one of Eric's very first lines, he had missed a negative sign.  Carried through the entire proof, the negative sign changed everything, and Eric had once again proved that all matter should be exploding apart.

My question is - is there some real science here?  Does anyone know what equations he might have been working with, or what specific problems he might have been referring to?  This was around 2005, so before the most recent Higgs finding.  I'm wondering if this was a story mostly told to comfort us first year students, that even a nobel prize winner could miss a negative sign."

2.) I could work my ass off, go to the right conferences conferences, meet the right people, seek out some cool collaborations, and transfer to a much better school after my Masters. I'd end up with a PhD from a much better school, and work towards a career in academia.  

3.) I could stay at this school, do a post doc or two, stay about middle-of-the-road, and enter the private sector (the city I'm in has multiple international optics companies). But - I could pivot to work on things like hobbies, relationships, and close friends.

2) Wouldn't an absorbed photon have to be **exactly** the correct wavelength for the electron it is exciting?  What if there is a 0.00001 eV difference between the photon absorbed and the change in energy of the electron? How would energy be conserved?

Thanks!

Finding time of flight with a negative initial Y value,9,1,False,False,False,Physics,1492773982,True,"Hello all!  I am a programmer, and I am looking to create a pretty simple ballistics calculator for video games.  Right now, it can calculate an angle to hit a given X, Y coordinate perfectly.  However, to add windage, I need to know how long the projectile is sustained in air (to see how much it's affected by wind).  However, if the player is shooting up hill (meaning, their initial Y value is negative), it gives the calculations some issues.  Is there any solution to this problem?

"**Lemaitre Stole ""Big Bang"" from Ancient Greek Origin Mythology**",4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1492790394,True,"Lamaitre, the Catholic priest, probably didn't intend to steal the ancient Greek origin mythology but he probably read it and thought it was his idea. He was deeply inspired by Genesis 1:1, probably thinking about it over and over, his whole life. Eventually, he tied the two together and thought it was his original 'divine' inspiration. The ironic outcome is Ancient Greek Origin Mythology ""big bang"" is better than Lamaitre's effort to fit Genesis 1:1.  
  
Ancient Greek Origin Mythology:  
**Chronos was ""engendered"" by ""earth and water"", and produced Aether and Chaos, and a Cosmic egg** - Chronos = Time, Aether = Space, Chaos = Disorder, Cosmic Egg = Universe  
  
Lamaitre's Hypothesis:  
**Lemaitre initially called his theory the ""hypothesis of the primeval atom"" and described it as ""the Cosmic Egg exploding at the moment of the creation.""**  
  
Proof that Lemaitre still believed in Genesis 1:1, that a jew-god 'created' the Universe, direct quote from Lemaitre:  
**We cannot end this rapid review which we have made together of the most magnificent subject that the human mind may be tempted to explore without being proud of these splendid endeavors of Science in the conquest of the Earth, and also without expressing our gratitude to One Who has said: ""I am the Truth,"" One Who gave us the mind to understand him and to recognize a glimpse of his glory in our universe which he has so wonderfully adjusted to the mental power with which he has endowed us.**"

There is a 500g block of some material whose Curie point is around 80 Kelvin. It is placed in a bath of liquid nitrogen. The bath and block together are placed underneath a large permanent magnet

When the material cools sufficiently it becomes ferromagnetic and accelerates up out of the bath and sticks to the permanent magnet. While up there it starts to heat back up and loses its ferromagnetism and falls back down into the nitrogen bath. It then cools and flies back up, warms and falls back down, etc.

Physics as a hobby vs doing a PhD,18,42,False,False,False,Physics,1492965585,True,"I completed my undergraduate degree in physics in a good university (outside the US). Because of financial commitments, I couldn't leave for grad school straight away. So I worked for a couple of years as a research assistant at the same university after I graduated. I did very well, got four papers out in around three years and picked up a master's by research for that. I loved my time working in physics but the research assistant job was a temp job at best and I eventually had to leave it.

Now I work at a well known engineering company. The job is relaxed and spare time is plenty and I'm being paid well. There are good opportunities for growth because the company is about to expand in a big way. I also love having enough time for hobbies, fitness and just life in general. On the flipside, the work I do is not intellectually challenging. 

I also applied to PhD programs in the US and was accepted into several good ones. The reason I applied was primarily because I really miss physics and I am interested in being really good at core physics. I have this feeling that my education is unfinished in some way. I want to be that guy who has a deep understanding of fundamental physics. That guy who can easily answer questions on the physics stacks. Maybe I'd even like to write a textbook someday. I liked research when I did it but to be honest, I'm not sure I have that same fierce passion for it as I do for learning. In addition to this, I know I'm not cut out for the academic tenure track - Even if I were smart enough (and this is not impostor syndrome or anything, I am self aware enough know that I am good but not great), I have no interest in chasing low paid postdocs and living with the general instability of post PhD life. In five years, when I complete my PhD, I will likely end up in a very similar job to what I have now.

With this in mind, should I simply stay in my regular job and do physics as a side hobby or actually do the PhD? Of course, it's a personal choice in the end but clear headed advice is what I'm looking for. 

TL;DR If ""learning"" is the real goal, is it smarter to do physics as a hobby and retain the perks of a good career rather than enroll in a PhD?"

http://vlab.amrita.edu/index.php?sub=1&brch=201&sim=368&cnt=4

I'm calculating the expected frequency but am somehow there's a different between my calculation and the frequency within the simulation. For example, one of the experiments I tried was setting the source frequency at 180 Hz and both source/detector velocities at 200 m/s. The Approaching frequency was measured at 676.55 Hz and the passing frequency was 47.89 Hz. It should be noted that the object's are both approaching each other at 200 m/s.

Approach Frequency = 676.55 Hz;
Passing Frequency = 47.89 Hz;
Detector v = 200 m/s [From the left];
Source v = 200 m/s [From the right];
Source Frequency = 180 Hz;

However, when I did the calculations I got a slightly different answer. I am using the generalized Doppler Effect equation; and the answers I'm getting are:

Approaching Frequency = 683.496 Hz
Passing Frequency = 47.403 Hz

I'm just curious as to what I'm doing wrong. I know that it's only 7.046/0.487 Hz difference but I'm puzzled. Would it have anything to do with the object's approaching each other at 200 m/s? "

Perhaps there are other vectors that are used when you start dealing with tensors and things, however I am not really sure how that works at this point. "

Recycling plutonium from nuclear waste,4,15,False,False,False,Physics,1493050748,True,"I was told by my physics teacher to take a standpoint on the issue recycling the plutonium used in nuclear waste in America, come up with an idea that would help with the issue based on your standpoint, then talk to others about refuting arguements to my idea.

First, we were taught that America does not recycle the plutonium because of Jimmy Carter's prohibition to recycle it and instead to treat it as waste because

1. it  could be susceptible to interception by terrorests and used as a nuclear weapon.

2. It was not cost-effective to bring all nuclear waste to a couple recycling plants scattered throughout the nation (which gives a greater opportunity of interception) or to open many nuclear recycling plants. 

Now almost all nuclear waste sits under Yucca mountain in safe containers.


So my standpoint is that there is no question that if nuclear waste is intercepted, bad things will happen, so it should be protected, but it should also be recycled. My 2 ideas: since we already have to bring nuclear waste to one place (mount yucca) why do we not open a recycling plant inside the storage facility; this way the plutonium which would be dangerous in the wrong hands would not exist to be stolen anymore because it would be recycled and used up as fuel.

Anyone care to debate and/or provide insite?

Note: My only background in physics is im taking algebra based physics this year and we're on the last section which is nuclear. Im not a professional - so please take it easy on me

Looking around online it seems that most sources say that a second sun wouldn't be as devastating as I hoped, so I figured it'd just pull some bullshit and say that the suns are heating up in the process to accomplish the worldwide looming heat-death that I'm looking for.

Besides this though, what are some other things that would occur in this theoretical situation? I'm sure ocean-related shenanigans such as tides being completely wrong and bodies of water evaporating would occur, and magnetic fields would be fucked as well, but I figured you science-y types might have a better idea of some interesting things that might occur."

If you go to the wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem) and skip to the line that starts ""Compare this with the predictions from quantum mechanics...""

An interesting question regarding the movie Interstellar...,81,80,False,False,False,Physics,1493088957,True,"First off, I loved this movie when I saw it. 

In my theoretical physics class, we were discussing light and near light travel. I couldn't help but think about a certain scenario from the movie.

So when the crew is visiting planets--mainly the one that consists mostly of [water](http://cinetropolis.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Interstellar-waterworld.jpg)--they leave the black guy up on the ship to orbit the planet. Even though they are only down there for minutes, decades pass on board the ship.

So my question is this: Since he is orbiting the planet, what if he were to observe them walking around with a telescope? Would they appear to be moving to slow motion, or is this not possible? What would he see? Thoughts?

Can I Study Supergravity at Undergraduate Level?,3,5,False,False,False,Physics,1493149857,True,"I am a junior undergraduate.

In Mathematics, my knowledge is limited to Multivariable Calculus, Complex Analysis, Special Functions, Tensor Analysis, Basics of Topology, and Basics of Group Theory. I have also read a bit of the so-called Advanced General Relativity (Cartan-Reimann Geometry, Weizenbock Spacetimes, Torsional Models, etc.).

Now, based on information I can gather in a non-mathematical way, I find SUGRA a very interesting topic and thus, I want to learn it. I am not sure how much knowledge of SUSY or QFT should be essential for SUGRA. In principle, it is a supersymmetric theory, so I guess some idea of SUSY must be essential. But from a very rough overview of books like Ortin, it seems that the symbols they have been using are only geometrical and thus, I can probably proceed with my current knowledge provided I learn some rudimentary QFT (from David Tongs or something). Kindly suggest what all should I know more to understand SUGRA. If there is some artificial way to understand some basic topics of SUGRA then also I would be interested. Like, I am reading Zweibach's String Theory book which discusses some of the String Theory without QFT and I am enjoying it. I know I will have to learn QFT eventually and I do want to and plan to.

Do physicists account for gravity in QM?,9,1,False,False,False,Physics,1493178085,True,"I was reading the text ""introduction to string theory"" notes for fun and it states:

"" Sometimes it is said
that we don’t understand how to fuse quantum mechanics and GR. This statement
is really incorrect, though for “NY times purposes”, it’s fine. In fact we understand
perfectly well how to include quantum mechanical effects into gravity, as long we we
dont ask questions about whats going on at distances, less than the Planck length. This
is not true for the other forces. That is, for the other forces we know how to include
quantum effects, at all distance scales.""

I was always led to believe that GR and QM were completely incompatible with each other, but this text says otherwise. He further elaborates on the point but the problem is, I can't seem to find any mentions of what he describes from other (easy to digest) sources. So I'm wondering if what he describes is covered in advanced courses/textbooks like QFT and so on. I'm currently finishing my first sequences in analytical and quantum mechanics, so relativistic QM is something I haven't covered yet.

What can a great physicist do? Dunning-Kruger effect,11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493181402,True,"Edit: the point of this post is to come up with an objective set of skill benchmarks for students.


The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where a person might think they're much better at a subject or skill than they actually are. Many people experience this coming into college as a big fish from a small pond. A way to combat this is to ""know thyself"" but one cannot do so without the input of other people. In an effort to combat this effect and establish a realistic perspective of skill as a physicist, I hope we can compile enough opinion about what a great physicist does and how they do it, to come close to an approximation of the ideal skill set and level for a top level professional.

Edit: We may or may not have to make a distinction between theory and experiment but let's just see what people say and I'll compile from there.

How can I foster an environment that makes students excited about doing physics?,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493209883,True,"I have been taking some tutorials for lower-division physics classes this year, and was beginning to feel quite dejected at the fact that the class isn't really willing to participate. Every attempt to discuss the topics and have a two-way conversation with the class just fell flat. 

In the last two weeks I have allowed students to schedule private tutoring sessions at other times that suit them, and the difference in attitude is immense. In the class setting many of these students are withdrawn and unwilling to answer/ask questions. In the one-on-one sessions, they're sponges for knowledge and I can barely answer one question before they're asking the next one. They become much less focussed on getting the answers out of me, and more focussed on really discussing the topics. 

But I'm only one person and I can't meet with every student every week; I have my own classes and assessments to attend to as well.

"Why people casting doubt on the speed of light being the ""speed limit of the universe"" bothers me. (And why it should bother you, I argue.)",110,117,False,False,False,Physics,1493231918,True,"I was lecturing on relativity today and mentioned that the speed of light is the ""speed limit of the universe"". A student said, ""... that we know of."" I got more excited than I should have at that and rather loudly dismissed his remark, but I'm not going to dwell on the impropriety of my lecture style.

Instead, I've reflected on why it bothers me so much when people suggest that we might travel faster than light. My knee-jerk reaction came from the fact that to go faster than the speed of light, we would have to abandon so much physics, especially causality. Every faster-than-light theory I've ever seen really boils down to absurdities that run contrary to principles that we take to be by far the most holy.

But I've realized why suggestions that faster-than-light travel evoke such a strong negative reaction from me. Suppose I had been lecturing on Newton's second law and said, ""Force equals mass times acceleration,"" and a student piped in to say, ""... that we know of."" Or suppose I had said, ""Kinetic energy is always positive,"" and a student said, ""... that we know of."" Those are theories that could technically be violated, but would likewise result in absurdities as Earth-shaking as v>c.

The reason people cast doubt on the speed of light being the speed limit of the universe is because it is wrapped up in the romantic ideas of time travel and space travel. Have you always wanted to visit the Andromeda galaxy? It's 2.5 million light years away. Even with special relativity, you could *theoretically* explore the galaxy, but without it, you even get to do it ""for free"". You could go to Andromeda, then come back to Earth and humans will still be alive, civilization will be right where you left it, and you can tell all your friends and loved ones about the fantastic sights you saw. Under special relativity, everyone will be dead and Earth will have aged a minimum of 5 million years.

With faster-than-light travel, you could even travel back in time, and who doesn't want to do that? You could meet with your past self and find out what a conversation with yourself might look like. You could give yourself life advice and say what lottery numbers to pick. You can ""cheat"" at life, even in a somewhat small way if there are restrictions on what you can communicate.

So the reason it bugs me when a student or anyone casts doubt on the speed of communication being finite is because they're being ""selectively skeptical"". I can lecture for hours on physical principles that students will pleasantly nod at, write in their notes, and accept as fact. Suggest that we are stuck with a maximum attainable speed, however, and suddenly, then and only then do students begin to pipe in with, ""Well, maybe that's not so!"" It's good to keep an open mind and to be skeptical, but not to target your skepticism at a particular theory that you *wish* weren't true."

Total energy of the universe?,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493246386,True,"First off, I am a senior in high school and I am taking a pretty low-level physics class, but I plan on majoring in physics next year so I often research more complex topics than my teacher is used to teaching.  My teacher is one of the best I've ever had, but sometimes I question his knowledge of more current physics topics.  Today, I was trying to explain how negative GPE works as I understand it, but we didn't seem to be on the same page as far as what the consensus was on the total energy of the universe.  As far as I thought, most physicists agreed that the universe started at the big bang and was able to come into existence because the total energy of the universe is, and always has been, 0.  To my surprise, he seemed to convey that physicists are split fairly evenly between a universe with a positive, constant total energy that has always existed and a universe with 0 total energy that started at the big bang.  To be clear, when I say universe, I mean the visible universe, or the universe within our causal horizon (or whatever its called, I'm a little new to this subject), not the multiverse.  I am just wondering if the model I subscribe to is as concrete as I thought, or is there still a lot of debate between the two?

I'm a student from a non-physics science field delving into some physics classes. I had all the standard basic maths courses back when I started out, but it was a while ago, and as I would like to now go back to do somewhat more theoretical stuff and looking over the material, I feel like I definitely need a refresher just to help me get a grip on calculating things again and follow the proofs better. Can anyone recommend a good book that goes into the kinds of maths that would be useful for following classes, specifically one in classical electrodynamics? It doesn't need a lot of frills since I've theoretically done all of it before in some form but it would be nice if it had a good deal of examples on just how to calculate certain complicated integrals, differential equations, etc. so that if I come across something I've forgotten how to do I can read it up. So far, I've been getting by just googling stuff, but I feel like I would want something that gives a bit more of a complete picture that I can read just read/work through. 

And if anybody has a recommendation for a book that goes into classical electrodynamics starting from a basic level and perhaps also giving some intuitive examples, that would be great as well.

Thank you so much guys."

Help understanding/conceptualizing gravitational waves?,6,5,False,False,False,Physics,1493343247,True,"Hello, I'm having trouble understanding gravitational waves (and space time as a physical concept). I get that gravitational waves are supposed to be compressions and expansions of the fabric of space time , but what exactly is contracting/ what is the wave propagating through?   

On NASA website and the LIGO website they don't seem to address this, and I wasn't able to find a satisfactory answer through google yet. I know space time is said to be a field, but I'm unsure how to actually conceptualize this.

From what I understand, light waves don't need a medium to travel through because they're discrete particles that also act as waves themselves, but I feel like for this explanation to apply to gravity, there would need to be particles to carry the gravitational force (but gravity is said to be an illusionary force, so no particles).

What is the velocity of a high-intensity gravitational wave? Can it be greater than the speed of light as measured by an observer infinitely far from the wave?,5,9,False,False,False,Physics,1493379887,True,"Obviously, for a low intensity gravitational plane wave, we can treat it as a normal plane wave moving in flat space, so the answer would be 'the speed of light'.

However, a very intense gravitational wave distorts space-time to such an extent that it's not clear what the speed of light would refer to in this case. If we take the speed of the wave to be equal to the *local* speed of light then this would not be the same as the speed of light observed by an observer infinitely far away from the wave and I see no a-priori reason why it should be bounded to always be lower than that externally measured speed of light.

So, do very intense gravitational waves alow for FTL communication, or is there a theorem that limits their speed, as observed by an external observer infinitely far from the wave, to being lower than C?"

I need your opinion! Are there two ways of considering these graphs?,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493392990,True,"Hello guys. I have just done a test at uni about mechanics ( and thermodynamics). I am going to request your thoughts about this, pretty simple, exercise, because as I believe there are two methods in which the answer can be given. So I attach you the pic of the graph, here: http://imgur.com/a/hda6R It is about the driven armonic oscillation (theory here:http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/315/Waves/node13.html). It asks about the mass, you know elastic constant (K) and have to obtain the ω, then you can use formula: ω=(K/m)1/2 In my belief, omega could be acquired from omega=2pi/T and from T=2pi it would be 1. Other way, aka my way, is that considering that from point one (that asks what's between the two graphs the one of position and the one of velocity) the equations of position and velocity are: x=A cos(ωt-φ) v=-ωA sin(ωt-φ). Considering that from graphs, the amplitude of position graph is 1/2 and the velocity one is 1 the only way possible is that omega is 2 ! Now is on you folks, don't you think both solutions are possible? P.s.(In the graph, continuos line is position, dashed line is velocity)

Net work done question,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493487848,True,"The basis of this question is that it's a block moving up an inclined plane with friction.

Okay, so as I understand, you can use 1/2mv^2 - 1/2mu^2 to find the net work done, in terms of the energy. When I do this in my question, I get 60 as my work done.

I've also been using dalemberts law, fsum - ma =0, rearranging it to get fsum = ma. My ma = 6, and my force sums = 6 also, which are Ffriction + Fgravity + Fpullingforce.

So, when I then go to figure out work done from what we gathered from dalemberts law, I can use wd  = f x d and get around a 75 value, and then I can also use (F x s) + (W x h), with F being a negative friction value, and also get around 75.

So is there something I'm doing wrong or not noticing? I'm getting one value from the energy perspective for work done as 60, and then from my other point of view I'm getting two 75 values (of which should make sense, as the dalembert method i used all checks out as I said above).

"Is there a physics explanation for the ""overtones"" heard when a chord is perfectly in tune? Or is it purely a psychoacoustical phenomenon? [Musical Acoustics]",27,117,False,False,False,Physics,1493495804,True,"I know about the overtone series of musical pitches and everything, but I'm talking about something different. This is a phenomenon worshipped as a core goal of virtuosic barbershop quartet singing. When all four voices are perfectly in tune, the chord locks so well that it starts to sound like there are more than 4 distinct voices singing. This is called an ""overtone"" (perhaps a confusing term, given that it has a distinct meaning from the overtones present in the harmonic series of musical pitches).

For example, listen to the final chord of [this song](https://youtu.be/NQ9_sHr4LXg?t=2m18s). The four notes being sung are Eb3, Eb4, G4, and Bb4 (left to right, the singers are singing Bb4, Eb4, Eb3, G4). But in addition to that, you hear a distinct 5th note, an Eb5, sounding above the other notes as if a 5th person is singing it. 

Eb5 is in the overtone series of the Eb4 and the Eb3, but it is not an overtone of the G4 or the Bb4. However, the G and Bb are crucial to get it to appear: two voices singing an Eb3 and an Eb4 will not produce an Eb5 that sounds as loud and present as the one in the video. This means there has to be something beyond the simple overlap and reinforcement of common harmonics in the voices.

Is there a physics explanation of how the sound of an Eb5 can be produced given those conditions? Or is it just a trick on the brain, making it perceive a certain pitch with disproportionate loudness?

Super luminal travel and causality speculation,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493582589,True,"I know this post is complete speculation, but in my head to sort of makes sense. Feedback is appreciated.

Let's say you're in a spaceship travelling away from earth at an increasing speed. For you, light speed would remain the same, but time outside the ship would slow. Eventually you go so fast that time seems to stop outside the ship. If you could push your speed further, a theoretical threshold could be crossed, reversing the direction of time (and light) outside the ship. You would arrive at an alien planet in the relative past.

From Earth's perspective, you would move from your position in the sky to an alien planet faster than light, since it would take light that much time to travel from the alien planet's past to Earth's present.

So far, causality hasn't been violated. But if you were to travel back to Earth from the alien world's past, you would arrive in Earth's distant past, which does break causality.

Therefore, if this theoretical speed threshold did exist, then once you arrived at the alien world, time outside of the ship would have to spring forward without you being able to interact with the outside world, I think. It might even happen as soon as you dropped below the threshold.

Does this make sense? Could a threshold like thia exist in reality? Should I have put this into a creative writing sub instead? Thanks for your time."

Is magnetic field real or just an effect of special relativity?,6,3,False,False,False,Physics,1493584961,True,"If we consider two charged particles traveling in parallel in the same direction at a constant velocity the two particles will experience the repulsive force of the electric field and the attractive force due to the magnetic field produced by the current that the particles produce moving.

If the particles are fast enough these two forces almost compensate each other and this is well known by accelerator physicist that see the so-called space charge effect disappearing for ultra relativistic particles in an accelerator.

Now if we consider the dynamics in the frame of the particles, the only force present there is the electric force because they do not see any motion, so no current, no magnetic field. So the particles should experience the repulsive force and diverge in their paths. The reason why this doesn't happen is that in the frame of the particles the time is so slow that it takes a lot of time for the repulsive force to act, due to the special relativity transformation.

In a pure newtonian-galileian system the magnetism cannot be explained. Newton say that forces are the same in all the inertial frames but this example cannot work because for newton the two particles should have an electric force compensated by the magnetic force in the lab frame and only an electric force in the particle frame.

So my conclusion is that the magnetic field is not a real field but it is the deformation of the electric field due to the Lorentz transformations. In other words it should be possible to deduct the Maxwell equations and the Lorentz force starting from the Coulomb law and the special relativity, without the need of the magnetic field that has to emerge naturally.

If this idea is correct, I cannot understand how a magnetic monopole is possible. I know that Dirac proved that a magnetic monopole would have as consequence the quantization of the electric charge (as we can see from the experience) but it is a nonsense a static magnetic charge if the magnetic field is a consequence of the relative motion of reference systems."

Question about the Twin's Paradox in Special/General Relativity,13,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493668755,True,"EDIT: Thanks to /u/Arkalius (and probably others) for pointing out the solution. The part I was missing is that the gravitational time dilation is based on the change in gravitational potential, not gravitational force multiplied by the time in the gravitational field. Since the turn around effectively creates a uniform gravitational field, the change gravitational potential is proportional to the distance away from Earth, which explains the situation. This makes sense to me now.

My apologies if this has been asked before, but I couldn't find anywhere that has an answer to this question.

###### **The Twin's Paradox**

Special relativity indicates that as you approach the speed of light, time begins to slow down for you.

The Twin's Paradox is as follows: two twins decide to build a spaceship that can go close to the speed of light. One twin stays on Earth, while the other takes the spaceship out for a drive and then returns to Earth. For the sake of simplicity, let's say the spaceship leaves moving in a straight line, stops, and comes back in a straight line.

From the point of view of the Earth twin, the spaceship twin is moving and thus should be younger. However, from the point of view of the spaceship twin, the Earth twin is moving and thus should be younger.

.

###### **The commonly cited solution**

If you google this problem, most solutions to the paradox focus on General relativity and the fact that the spaceship twin has to turn around. As I understand it, the situation is as follows:

* From the point of view of the Earth twin: the spaceship twin is aging more slowly on both the outgoing and the return trip, and the twin spaceship twin turning around does not affect the Earth Twin. Thus, the spaceship twin should be younger when they return.

* From the point of view of the spaceship twin: the spaceship twin is aging more slowly on both the outgoing and the return trip. BUT, when the spaceship twin turns around they are no longer in an inertial reference frame. From their point of view, the entire universe appears to be accelerating. Based on the equivalence principle, this situation is identical to that of being in a gravitational field. Time runs slower in a gravitational field, and thus, from the spaceship twin's point of view, the Earth twin is aging much faster during this turnaround. Presumably, if you do the calculations you will find that this extra aging for the earth twin is enough to make up whatever time the Earth twin gained due to time dilation of their apparent motion on the outgoing and return trips. In fact, it will make up for this difference and more, such that when the spaceship twin returns home he still will be younger than the Earth twin.

Presumably, this explanation should work well for other paths as well. For example, if the spaceship twin went in a circle instead of a straight line back-and-forth path, the time dilation from constant sideways acceleration in the spaceship twin's frame of reference would overcome time dilation from the Earth twin's apparent motion.

.

###### **My Question**

One thing the above explanation doesn't go into is how long the trip is. If you assume the Spaceship twins turn-around period (where they are accellerating) is short enough to be negligible, the age difference should increase linearly with trip length (this is clear from the reference frame of the Earth Twin). But, from the reference frame of the spaceship twin, this seems problematic. Unless I am missing something, for this to be true in the spaceship twin's reference frame it seems like one of the following needs to happen:

* 1) The amount of time during the turn around period that the Spaceship twin gains (due to acceleration) must increase the farther away he gets from Earth, since there is more of a time difference that needs to be ""made up"" due to a longer amount of time lost by the velocity time dilation due to the Earth twin's apparent motion.

* 2) The fact that in the Earth twin's reference frame the universe is (approximately) stationary for the whole trip, but in the spaceship twin's reference frame it is constantly in motion, must somehow affect the symmetry of the time dilation of the non-accelerating parts of the trip.

Option 2 seems a bit more reasonable to me, but neither seems intuitively obvious based on what I know of general and special relativity (which, admittedly, is for the most part only a basic conceptual understanding).

You also get a similar problem if you consider the circular path case. Here, as you increase the length of the path you are able to make the circle that the spaceship travels along wider. This, in turn, reduces the acceleration required to keep the circular path, and thus should reduce the amount of time dilation that the sideways acceleration produces.

Either way, it seems like the math to make the answers in both reference frames consistent would only work out in both reference frames for a few specific trips, not in general. Now I know that this isn't the case, and that the linear relationship between trip length and the amount of time dilation is correct ([this](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/2576) post shows this pretty clearly). But, I'm having trouble understanding how the mechanisms that make the spaceship reference frame results agree follow this linear trend as well.

Thanks in advance!"

So, I'm a HS student and I'm taking physics. This last term we studied ""modern"" physics, meaning relativity and nuclear physics introductions.

In relativity, my teacher likes to use a relative mass that is m_rest x gamma, gamma meaning the Lorentz factor.

I personally don't like that and I prefer to think of mass a constant. Then, we both had an argument: she said that photons have mass, because E=mc^2 and I said they can't equal that because m=0. I said that because E^2 = (mc^2 )^2 + (pc)^2 and m=0, then E=pc, thus linear momentum is directly proportional to the energy (frequency) of the photon.

Then, after this, she said that for any given particle, p=mv must apply, but I also disagree, because relative momentum is defined as p=mv*gamma. Then as v=c, gamma=1/0, and we get p=infinity in every case in which m=/=0. To solve this I said that m should equal 0 to make p=0/0, which is indetermined, but not infinity, which is just wrong.

Maybe you can point me in the right direction, because right now I'm just a confused HS student that has a really underwelming teacher.

Astrophysics major - HELP,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493744455,True,"WARNING: This is gonna be a little lengthy for the sake of clarity. 

Hello all,

Before I get started, a little background about me: I am attending the University of Minnesota for Astrophysics, with two years of ""college-level"" physics under my belt from high school. 

About my high school education: The physics course(s) I took were considered a joint class (i.e. a two-year course). They were literally the hardest classes one could take at my high school, and being in the same city as my chosen university, one would hope these courses could prepare a student for college-level physics. We went through everything, including quantum mechanics and special relativity. The first problem arrises here: WE USED NO CALCULUS. Only algebra for all of the two years. 

My math courses were also relatively high-level; they were only one step below the level of my physics courses. My senior year, I was in calculus. However, until arriving at the UofM, I had never heard that derivatives were LIMITS. I don't understand what the hell my math teacher was teaching us if she didn't provide that basis for the material with what I know now. There was also no basis behind how the assorted differentiation rules work, no proof behind the concepts, only loose memorization tactics. 

So now we arrive to my college math and physics experience: last semester (my first semester), I took Calc I again, due to my expected lack of understanding from the previous year's course. This class was led by a professor who consistently made mistakes, and even asked US how to do problems. In lecture. Yeah. So this semester, I've been in Physics II, and they've been steadily using 3000-level (junior-level) math for this 1000-level introductory physics course for STEM students. 

Here's my question (finally): considering I am a week and a half away from the end of my freshman year, and I still have not sufficiently passed Calc I...what do I do? I have no idea what classes to register for next semester as I don't know if there's any chance of me saving my Astrophysics career. 

All advice is appreciated. Once again, my apologies for the lengthy post. "

Math Courses As a Physics Undergrad,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1493752087,True,"Hey, sorry if this is the wrong place to post. 

I'm about to end my freshman year at a liberal arts college and I intend to study and make my main focus in undergrad physics. The way i have things planned (and my college has planned for most pure physics undergrads) after the sophomore year, students take pretty much 4 physics courses each semester culminating in a thesis at the end of the senior year. This means that I will have taken introduction to calculus, introduction to analysis, linear algebra, vector calculus, and complex analysis (maybe but open to other suggestions). I was kinda just wondering whether this would be sufficient or whether I should take anything else (possibly instead of complex analysis)? 

Thanks in advance for all your help!"

All the Mech. Enginering type books focus on 'machine part' type problems (homogenous material bars and plates with surface tractions).  Landau and Lifschitz's book is better for explaining how to set up PDE's, but doesn't deal with boundary conditions between different materials, or how to set up boundary conditions for 'local' problems embedded in a larger global problem.  For instance, the entire wafer will be bowed a' la Stoney's equation due to an oxide layer, but you shouldn't need to grid up the whole wafer to see the local effect in the oxide film of a small metal stripe on top).

Any good references or shareware solvers for 2D problems like this?

Help me understand quantum entanglement!,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493764954,True,"I'm struggling to understand the concept of quantum entanglement. I've distilled my understanding into an analogy, and I need your help to validate it. Here it is:


Let's say I receive two envelopes. Both envelopes have this written on them:

> Hello! Open this letter...

>    + If the paper inside is red, then other envelope has blue paper.

>    + If the paper inside is blue, then other envelope has red paper.


So, if I open one of the letters, and the paper inside is red, then I know that the other letter contains blue paper.

Couple questions:

1. Is this equivalent to quantum entanglement? The fact that I will know the color of the other paper when I open (i.e. observe) one envelope?

2. In theory, if one of the letters ""appeared"" in a different galaxy, I would still know the color of the paper inside that letter, just by opening my letter, instantly, correct?

3. Before I open the letter, is the paper inside each envelope in superposition (??), i.e. 50/50, red or blue?

4. In this analogy, I am assuming that what's written on the letters is true. Is this a correct assumption in quantum physics? I think so yes?

5. In real quantum physics, would I be able to change the color of one paper, so that I change the color of the other one? No right?"

I said that the force of the ball on their hand is equal to the force of the ball leaving the bat, because F=ma and the mass is constant and the acceleration is the same, just in the opposite direction, but that doesn't seem right.

How come this absorption can be allowed when its not a resonance freq. of the whole thing, and is it possible to see a stretching band for, for example, only one of the hydrogens in water?"

Does Information Cause Wave Function Collapse?,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1493850490,True,"I have a question regarding the collapse of the wave function. According to many scientists collapse is caused by decoherence. That is the interaction between a particle and many other particles (e.g. the measuring aparatus). However in the case of the delayed choice quantum eraser (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Kim_EtAl_Quantum_Eraser.svg/401px-Kim_EtAl_Quantum_Eraser.svg.png) this does not seem to be the case. It seems that if an observer CAN (not does) know the which path information, the particles will collapse at the slit and thus behave like classical particles. If the observer cannot possibly know the which path information the wave functions do not collapse at the slit. Only at the detector will each wave function collapse. Thus forming the typical interference pattern.

So again: it seems that infomation causes the collapse at the slit. You may have heard the saying: if a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it will it make a sound? According to this interpretation the tree will fall if an observer COULD know that it has fallen (e.g. through vibrations in the earth or photons etc.), however if the tree were somehow isolated e.g. in a box it would be in superposition between fallen falling and upright. Schrödingers tree so to speak.

Is this interpretation, information causes collapse, correct? Are there any other possible interpretations?"
Making sense of why any (simplified) yoyo will accelerate at 2g/3,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1493852146,True,"We are doing Lagrangian Mechanics right now. For one of our problems, we need to find the acceleration of a simple ""yoyo"" -- basically a cylinder with a string wrapped around it that is under the influence of gravity. Now, I solved the problem, and checked the answer with our book, and I got the correct answer a = 2g/3. It makes sense that the acceleration wouldn't depend on mass; however, I don't understand how it could not depend on radius. It seems to me like a greater radius would allow a greater torque about the center of the cylinder. Maybe a larger radius would also allow gravity to provide greater torque on the side opposite the string? Does anyone have a good justification for why the acceleration doesn't depend on radius?"

To illustrate, take a look at [this U-profile](https://www.google.nl/search?q=u-profile&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy-6TrtNjTAhWEORQKHTxUAWwQ_AUIBigB&biw=1920&bih=950#imgrc=fFlSjfamqF9xLM:). Size H1 will be bolted to the arm, and side H2 will slide inside the monitor. You can assume the center of gravity to be exactly above H2. At what weight/material will the profile bend down?

AP Physics Project Ideas,14,2,False,False,False,Physics,1493990652,True,"Hey /Physics , I was assigned to do a physics project for my final in my AP Physics class. I'm a little dry on ideas and was hoping someone might help me out :)."
help me understand why the photoelectric effect experiment is not consistent with classical interpretation,36,24,False,False,False,Physics,1493991231,True,"Help me understand this, if anyone can. We were always told that the famous experiment with the photoelectric effect, supposedly proving that light is quantized, was inconsistent with the classical view of EM radiation as a radiant wave. The explanation was that you would expect light of greater intensity to liberate electrons, because it should only be necessary to overcome the attraction of the Coulomb force, and a wave of greater intensity has a greater change in the E field. So increasing the intensity, in the classical view, should have been adequate to liberate more electrons from the target. The experimental result, that there is a minimum frequency the radiation has to have, in order to liberate electrons from the target, supposedly demonstrates that the light is quantized.

There are a couple problems with this that have always bothered me. First, you can see that the reasoning is based on the ""plum pudding"" model of matter, in which the charges are just sitting there, waiting to acted on by forces. If what they said were right, then radiation would not have been necessary at all, but simply a static E field should have been enough to liberate electrons. And you can see that they already knew that that would not be enough. 

Now anyone can see that in the classical atom, like the Bohr model atom, in which the electron is in motion like an orbit, the application of a static E field would not be enough. Because, in one position, the field might be pulling the charges apart, but on the other side, it would be pushing them closer together. If you take a mechanical system analogous to the bohr model atom, say, just a bowl with a marble rolling back and forth in it, you can easily see that pushing the bowl in an oscillating fashion will liberate the marble if it is done with a certain frequency, but below that frequency, it will not liberate the marble at any amplitude (which in this analogy would be the distance the bowl was displaced, analogous to the intensity of the light wave). The classical bohr atom should have been expected to behave similarly. An EM wave that was lower in frequency than the frequency of the orbit of the electrons should be expected to fail to liberate any of them. 

To put it another way, a wavelength that was too great would not be able to apply a splitting force to the atom, because both the electron and the nucleons would be in almost the same field. It would be like a boat at sea, disturbed by a wave with a wavelength much longer than the boat. It would not significantly tip the boat, because stern and bow would be under the same force. So the dimensions of the boat determine what wavelength will tip it. The classical atom would have a characteristic wavelength of the same kind. In the classical view, you would expect there to be a minimum frequency to liberate electrons at all, and then, if you had the right frequency, you would expect the number of electrons liberated to be related directly to intensity, which is exactly what happens. 

I am not presenting an argument that light is not quantized, but simply asking why the experimental result is not consistent with the classical atom and the classical EM wave. Thanks for help."

I ordered some blue LEDs after reading some interesting studies about their antibacterial properties, for example this one: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26908743

Now I would like to know, if I can calculate J/cm² or W/cm² from values like the exposure time, the wattage of the led or, if it's easier to calculate, the luminous flux (L) and maybe the distance from the LED to the object?

Here are the specs of that LED:

10 Watt

90-100 Lumen

120° radiation angle

The distance from the LED to the object would be around 1 or 2 centimetres.

Is our perception of distance really a perception of how long it takes for light to reach our eyes?,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494002438,True,"Our eyes/brain can tell the difference between something far away from and something close to us. Is this because the photoreceptors in our eyes have a mechanism for measuring how long it takes light to reach them? The coffee cup on my table is just a little bit farther away than the pen. The time it takes for light to travel from the cup to my eyes must be just infinitesimally longer than the time from the pen. Can we really measure that difference? Also, I have the same question for size. All objects have an actual size based on volume, but they also have a perceived size. A building from far away looks much smaller than a building up close. Does the time it takes for the light to travel to an observer from the two building affect how we perceive their size? 

I'm making some assumptions here. I'm assuming on a basic level, the photoreceptors work by a photon entering them, exciting an electron, and causing an energy change that our brain measures. This is a very rough explanation, I'm sure. It all also could be totally wrong. So please, if my questions don't make any sense or my idea of how sight works is off base, tell me.

I also know that for the example I linked, I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 or I = 3I because there are three masses. My text book is telling me that the solution is 3(M)(r^2). I understand that I'm multiplying by 3 because there are three masses but why is the solution not 3*I_sphere => 3*(2/5)(M)(r^2 ) ? Doesn't the shape of the particles matter in this problem?

Taking a temperature,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494049560,True,"Slightly off-topic, I'm sorry.  Don't know where to post.

Suppose I take someone's body temperature.  There are three sources of error that I can think of.

1. Random error
2. Systemic error
3. User error

We all understand random error.  Systemic error could be (for example) a miscalibrated thermometer.

Human error is a non-random error which may or may not average to zero given additional observations.  For example, when taking a temperature, perhaps you don't put the thermometer far enough into the mouth (or wherever).  Perhaps you position the thermometer incorrectly, but if you took the temperature again, you may position it correctly.  In my mind, I'm picturing ""human error"", like not leaving the thermometer in long enough.

If I take a series of temperatures, is the best estimate of the true temperature the average or the mode?

Suppose I take a temperature 3 times.  It could be the case that I might make a mistake in taking the measurement.  For example, I could position the thermometer not far enough.  If this were the case, the mode is more likely to toss out the bad measurement.  The average would assign a weight to the bad measurement of 1/3.  The mode would likely assign a weight of 0 to the bad measurement.

How should I think of this?  Is the answer to this question obvious to anyone?"

I don't understand how a pipe with open ends can produce a standing sound wave,7,7,False,False,False,Physics,1494075722,True,"I understand how a string produces a standing wave: the wave starts at one end, bounces back from the other end that's either fixed or free to oscillate, and there's a continuous back and forth that produces the standing wave effect.

So my textbook goes over wave packets, and how they come from summing classical waves.

This way you create waves which have those many small oscillations inside them, having a group velocity, etc.

But after this chapter, just out of nowhere, since apparently in previous graphs-

1. The width of a single 'wave packet' is 1/12
(wave packet, as in from a superposition of lots of classical sine waves)

2. The graph of amplitude by wave K number is about 12 wide, if you consider the wave's width to be a width where its amplitude is greater than 1/2 (max amplitude is 1)

So... multiplying Δx Δk ~ 1


So... what?
Where the hell did that come from...?

 

To me the book just took two things, told me what they were, put them together and threw the equation at me.
What's worse is that other things are either based on this or similar.

For instance
Δw Δt ~ 1

And later, this is mathematically derived, but basically the same

Δx Δlambda ~ (lambda^2) /2pi

What's worse is that the heisenberg uncertainty principle comes 3-4 pages later in the chapter and that one is definitely important and also related. I have NO idea where some of this sh*t came from at all.



Help...

 

For instance in an example, you stand in a 20m long pier, and you notice there are always 15 wave crests within this pier. Calculate uncertainty.
Yes, this *is* fairly straightforwards, you clearly just apply ΔxΔlambda, but I've no idea HOW this makes sense.
How is there even uncertainty? In a graph of 

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Wave_packet_%28no_dispersion%29_instance.png

for instance, where's the uncertainty? ""Looks fine to me"", I might say. I understand that yes there's a wave number and a length to a wave packet but why these equations are sensible is beyond me.


None of this seems to have a point to it, so much so that I'm having a hard time understanding what I'm even confused about.

Thanks...

"Academics: how do you keep track of all of the nuances in definitions for your field, and all of the new developments?",7,6,False,False,False,Physics,1494175054,True,"I'm in the process of writing my astrophysics term paper, and I may well have bitten off more than I can chew. It seems like there are so many ways to define things, and the exact definition matters so much. I don't want to get bogged down in specific definitions/terms, since I'm having enough trouble understanding them and would get it wrong.

So, for example, say you can split tokens into two different groupings (really, there are more than 10): blue/red, or circle/square. The definition of the blue type has many things in common with the definition of the circle type (e.g. many tokens that are blue are also circular), but they're not exactly the same. If someone does some work under the assumption of the token being blue, I don't know how much of that work will also be valid for tokens that are circular. If I knew and understood everything about blue and circular tokens then I would also know what things are valid and what are not, but I'm still trying to learn all of it. I need to know what 'transfers' between definitions in order to build a framework, but then I need that framework inside my head first in order to know what 'transfers'. 

Add to that the fact that every second paper contradicts the others, and it looks like a mess. One person provides evidence that all blue tokens are warm, but another person provides evidence that all circular tokens are very cold. If most blue tokens are also circular, then this stops making sense and I get confused as to whether I have the terms wrong. Maybe I got confused early on about blue/red, and have been using the wrong term this whole time? Maybe one of the authors has used questionable methods that would make their conclusion hold less weight, but I don't know how to tell yet. 

How do you hold onto this spiderweb of semi-connected ideas and definitions? How can I know which results can be trusted and which are shoddy when I'm still learning it all? And how can I learn all of this from scratch, with little guidance? "

The only mechanism for this would appear to be that energy takes time to move throughout the universe; not all states are available at once. In this scenario, does this mean that at a fundamental level, the increase in the universe's entropy is limited only by the speed of light? (and by the speed of particles obviously)

I'm pretty sure that it is, but it brings some odd thoughts to mind when thinking about AdS/CFT...ie how far quanta are actually separated in the CFT. If anyone can answer that one I'd love to know too :)"

"Which measurements are conserved, and which are not? (e.g. energy, force, momentum, etc)",11,1,False,False,False,Physics,1494216809,True,"I'm studying thermodynamics right now, and I can't escape the notion that energy always being conserved seems pretty random. To me, energy is kg · m^2 · s^−2 . Why did we choose this measurement to be the pidgin language or the reserve currency for branches of physics? I guess in classical mechanics, we also get 'equal and opposite', so you might be able to get away with saying 'forces are always conserved' even if that's not quite the way to use the word conserve. Momentum is conserved. What isn't conserved?

The only example that I can think of is mass, as macroscopically, clearly things can combust into smaller things, so you have mass --> energy (heat). However, microscopically, I wonder if mass was perfectly conserved; it was just our imperfect understanding of this 'object' that isn't really a singular thing that led us to believe mass disappeared. That being the case, our conversions between types of measurements would seem more like a human problem than a description of nature.

Can anyone answer the question in the title and maybe give me a little intuition for the importance of something like energy (versus several other options)?"

What's the difference between the wave function Ψ, and |Ψ|^(2)?

Apparently Ψ is just the probability to find a particle at that point if we take an electron for example.
And |Ψ|^2 is the probability to find it in a unit volume.

But that really fails to iterate the difference to me. They sound the same.


For instance the issue is that apparently where x is a maximum in |Ψ|^2 gives the most likely location of the election. But wouldn't that be just Ψ as well?"
Could quantum properties point towards being part of a simulated multiverse?,14,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494232074,True,"Given the assumption that we live in a simulation, and one that is simulating every possible action/reaction system, would it not make sense to condense ""data"" the is being simulated in multiple ""systems""/""universes"" some what like zipping a file on a computer? in the double slit experiment the potential wave that each photon could travel would be simulated, then in each universe the destination the photon was measured to hit could be different with a minimal amount of calculations?
the main idea is that all subatomic action reactions that occur in multiple universes are actually being simulated in multiple realities at the same instant, leading to quantum particles not ""obeying"" the laws of physics because calculations at such small scales can be ""rounded"" to the nearest group of simulated universes with the most similar action/reaction pairs in order to condense data so that simulation can be carried out with the minimal amount of power/memory space use?

"Inverse of ""Physics for Gearheads""? [xpost /r/cars]",2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494262059,True,"Hello /r/physics!

I have never been interested in cars/motors throughout my childhood and adolescence. Most of my peers started arguing about Formula1 or this motor and that motor or moped modding or w/ever when I was in elementary school, but I never understood how could they find any of that interesting. 

My high school physics classes (esp. thermodynamics, mechanics *et similia*) somehow sparked in me the interest for things that burn fuel to do things (aka industrial machinery and cars). Now that I got my first car I felt *really* bad the first time I looked under the hood and understood 0% of it, especially since I've always been a ""tear-it-apart-and-see-how-that-works"" guy. 

Now, I know there is a book out there titled ""Physics for Gearheads"" (https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Gearheads-Introduction-Dynamics-Motorsports/dp/0837616158) that explains physics concepts in terms familiar to car enthusiasts. Is there anything out there that does the inverse? I am really good at physics (high school physics, at least) and *loved* my third- and fourth-year dynamics, thermodynamics and mechanics lessons, and would love to get to understand how my car works in a way that's familiar to my sciencey background (going to study engineering in college next year). Do you have anything to suggest me? Books (I'm a huge book enthusiast), youtubers (I'm getting to know a channel called EngineeringExplained and loving it, that guy damn sure earned his engineering degree), comics, websites, anything.

"Quantum fields, particle physics and fibers.",10,6,False,False,False,Physics,1494262920,True,"Hello everyone.
I recently think about the fundaments of reality, which are - as our current understanding goes - quantum fields. These fields interact with each other, producing all known forces/particles. But I'd like to know how exactly these are connected to fiber bundles. IIRC, fibers itself map from a space 'above' spacetime; every particle or force has a fiber itself. So, for example, negative electric charge could be identified as a specific winding around another fiber. My questions are as follows: 1. Is everything correct until this point? Which ones are incorrect/inaccurate?
2. Which role play quantum fields in relation to these fibers?
3. If I want to dig deeper, what would be good literature? Or what articles/journals are recommended? And in which order should this topic be learned? Thanks!"

With physics, it actually excites me of where I COULD be down the road, the options I have, and my [current] end goal of where I'd like to be. Eventually, I'd like to go into astrophysics or cosmology. Thinking about the future and getting into research (no matter how boring and tedious it will be the majority of the time) just motivates me.

I understand that physics is a lot of math, my computational concentration will involve CS courses, and it's a lot of problem solving and analyzing rather than memorization (which is actually a huge relief for me, as that's what I'm better at). But I'm doubting myself. Will I be able to handle the work/course load? Will I be able to enjoy enough of the undergrad courses for me to make it onto grad school and study what I ultimately want to study? Am I cut out for it? Am I REALLY shooting too high like I thought I was before?

I see so many negative and ""Don't major in physics"" responses online to people who are considering majoring in it. I understand that you have to be realistic about such a choice, but it'd be nice to see why people chose physics, what motivated them, but also if they regret it at all, or anyone who struggled hardcore and why."

Did anyone modify Newtonian Gravity based on Maxwell's Theory?,78,52,False,False,False,Physics,1494444183,True,"As is well-known, Maxwell's equations were already consistent with Special Theory of Relativity while the Newtonian law of Gravitation wasn't. It can be shown by solving the equations of Maxwell for a dynamic system that the information of something done on a charged particle over here reaches somewhere else in time no shorter than it would take for the light to travel between the two places - without explicitly using any of the Relativity. Noticing the remarkable resemblance between the Coulomb's law and the Newtonian law of Gravitation, it is tempting to ask whether one can formulate something like Maxwell's equations (which contains the Newtonian law as a special case just like Maxwell's equations contain the Coulomb's law as a special case) for describing the Physics of Gravitation. I am curious as to whether such an attempt was ever made or not. There are chances that before General Relativity, people tried making the laws of Gravitation consistent with Special Relativity exactly along these lines. I know that General Relativity reduces to a set of four equations in the weak field limit (in some particularly chosen frames) which resembles Maxwell's equations to a great extent. But I am asking if such attempts were made before the formulation of General Relativity and whether they had got the right equations - the equations that we call today the gravitomagnetic equations (the equations that look like Maxwell's equations and are the weak field approximations of General Relativity)?

Volcanic ash plumes cause lightning and are called dirty thunderstorms in magnificent images (before the ash forms clouds):

Is my research useless?,128,198,False,False,False,Physics,1494503916,True,"Hey r/physics,

I'm a student currently working on my Master's thesis, to be specific I only just started with the research 2 months to go and have several more months of research ahead of me before really starting to write the thesis (this is how my professor and supervisor told me I should do it)

Anyways, I'm suffering a BIG problem: I don't really care about what we're doing. I specifically asked my Supervisor what would come of our research and if it would actually contribute anything but he just confirmed my suspicion that really most published papers by themselves don't amount to anything by themselves, or ever. Is this how it's always going to be? I recall Elon Musk saying that 90% or so of all papers are useless;

It seems that all the research done by postdocs or people working on their doctor's degree (the people getting paid) is to publish papers to convince people to sponsor them so they can hire more people to get PHDs who write more papers.... a circle that doesn't contribute anything to the outside.

Is this how it always is? Am I being overambitious in  trying to find something we could research that could actually be useful (like blue OLEDs)?"

Is there a real way to break down the full energy equivalence equation to isolate a definition for time in the sense of a moving particle?,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494518348,True,"E^2 = (mc)^2 + (pc^2)^2 
We all know it, we all love it. 
I've tried many times to isolate momentum as mass * time and substitute as much as I can to find something suitable to isolate for time. I'm assuming this would only be relevant since I'm sacrificing the definition for the assumption of movement. Essentially taking out relativistic momentum. (And please correct me if I'm wrong about anything I'm trying to explain... just a humble college student trying to understand a more complex perspective of time.) 

The algebra gets a bit tedious, and I've attempted many times and got different answers throughout most of it. I've subbed in momentum for mass*time, and momentum for energy * (velocity / c^2) 

I've even brought limits as V approaches C. To try to make it easier to equate with conditional substitutes such as that. What I'm really trying to do is find a perspective of time that can describe it more like how we did with velocity as a function of time. We have a solid definition that rarely fails under most physics modules. Hell... I've even tried to manipulate mass as area = 1/m^2 and gone from there. 

TLDR; is it actually possible to isolate time in such a way we can describe it empirically with known values, or is a tensor derivative from the 5th dimension necessary to access a definition of time before it undergoes simultaneous squeezing into the ""future"" time-line as a consequence of the present. 

Let me know if my question is moot or stupid. Correct me if I need correcting, just a curious young padawan in search of answers my professors won't care to spend time on. 

Thanks  

Edit: I'm really not trying to assume I know anything, everything I wrote I'm pretty sure is pulled from credible sources (textbooks, what I've learned in college physics, credible internet articles and such.) Not trying to get shit on, just trying to learn and understand. Like I said, feel free to correct me if I was wrong in assuming something. 

Edit 2) I know of the time dilation equation as well and have worked with it but there's not much to go from there, just describing a change of time. I mean to seek a single moment of time, in a sense, if that's possible. "
What is this (hologram?) technology called?,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494519138,True,"Five years ago, I was a summer intern at a major defense contractor. The site I worked for focused entirely on lasers and optics. I’ve long since lost contact with anyone who works there.

My first day there I was given a tour of the facility and saw several projects. The one that sticks out even today was some sort of hologram.

There was imagery of a local park that had been collected through some fashion. It was stored on what appeared to be a flat piece of plastic. (I recall that it was a paper‐thin, possibly rigid, sheet of material, but that could be a false memory.) When special lights were turned on in the room, this imagery visually “popped” out of the surface. I was amazed: from above I could see the tops of trees, but if I looked from the side I could also see *underneath* the foliage. It was like a real 3D model. It was entirely passive, with the lights the only thing needed to “activate” it.

What was this technology, and how does it work? I get the impression that it was not developed at my workplace, but purchased from some company that provides it as a service, so the capabilities are not kept under wraps. But I’ve never seen or heard of anything like it since.

Figured i would share this explanation of time in the context velocity in special relativity.,6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494552603,True,"If one really stops to think about it, 299,792,458 m/s or any stated rate of velocity for that matter is relative to the local frame of observation. This is directly dictated by the rate that time passes in any given frame. For instance light outside our solar system when compared to within, is traveling faster due to a lack of gravitational time dilation. yet if we leave the solar system we still measure the velocity the same. How is that possible one may ask? This is because we transition to the new frame with a new rate of time passage and adjust accordingly. This raises the question, If “c” is not a fixed rate everywhere throughout the universe, what does that really mean about causality? If time is not in sync everywhere how do we explain one event shooting much farther forward in time then another from an objective or median perspective? Seems like this would lead to drastic issues with the very nature of causality.

Lets say there are two objects, one in an earth like frame and one in one of the many voids between super clusters.

The same amount of time would pass for the two objects from a subjective perspective of each except one has the ability to travel extremely farther then the other in the same time period from each perspective. Not only a velocity difference from a median perspective but from the perspective of the faster object, the distance between the two objects would seem remarkably smaller. This spatial contraction would actually make the velocity being traveled by the faster object seem identical to the perspective of the slower object, strange right?

This actually means that the less gravity we are exposed to, the less the distance between two points in space. This is not what is actually occuring mind you, Only what seems to be occuring from the subjective perspective of the target. This has some pretty profound implications to our current ideas of “Spatial expansion” and what a “Light year” actually means.

What will really boil your brain later is that if the two objects both had clocks, they would seem to tick at an identical pace to each subjective perspective. Its not until they join the same frame and compare clocks that the massive differences would present themselves. What does this actually say about the nature of time or the validity of instrumentation to judge it? It should be noted that these four paragraphs culminate to illustrate nearly the entire wealth of human knowledge on the topic of time in the context of velocity in relativity from a 3-fold perspective."

However, since voltage increases the power output using the equation P=V^2/R suggests that the power output is larger than the power input. So how is this possible? Does R increase as well?
Also when considering P = I^2*R for power output, it is observed in a filament lamp it becomes brighter, hence deduced that power output increases. As it is the secondary coil for the step up transformer, the current will decrease. Therefore this equation P=I^2*R does not show that the power output increases in a step-up transformer. How does this make sense as well?

Measuring resistor value in liquid nitrogen. Does resistance go up or down?,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1494616116,True,"In physics today our instructor used liquid nitrogen to cool a resistor.

We're suspecting that the material in the resistor has changed and altered the expected outcome. 

I'm just learning, but I imagined that cooling the resistor would make a more effective resistor because you're cooling it's thermal properties.

Wouldn't an infinite universe ruin probability?,14,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494624465,True,"Suppose the universe/multiverse is infinite. Then, there would be an infinite number of Earths all carrying out a certain quantum experiment. Every possible outcome of this experiment then happens an infinite number of times.

This, of course, is not what is observed. Quantum experiments have different probabilities for different outcomes.

How Does Nuclear Fusion Release Energy?,26,21,False,False,False,Physics,1494657359,True,"I just cannot seem to understand how nuclear fusion releases energy. Every answer I find on the internet just points to a nuclear binding energy curve without actually explaining why the curve is how it is, or just says ""nuclear fission releases energy by fusing two small nuclei into a larger nuclei"" well... duh, lol. 

I cannot figure out an explanation on a nuclear level as to how fusion releases energy. 

Fission, on the other hand, makes total sense to me. The coulomb forces in a large nucleus are stronger than in small nuclei, so the strong interaction within the nucleus must be ""stronger"" within larger nuclei to keep the nucleus bound together. Once the large nucleus is broken apart the strong force no longer needs to be as ""strong"" as it previously was, and the resulting energy is released. 

I know I may have butchered that a little bit but at least that's how I understand it.

As far as how energy is released in nuclear fusion.. I'm still totally lost. "

Thus I have ample time in my hand to start off with the third year courses and I would like to get suggestions on how to do it. 

The courses are classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, electrodynamics (basically classical theory of fields) in the first semester of the third year and statistical mechanics and atomic and molecular physics (mostly atomic and molecular models, spectroscopy, and relativistic aspects such as Lamb shift) with a physics elective. 

I'm using the texts that are generally suggested and am also referring to Susskind's lectures. For problems I've obtained problem sets from professors who take the courses. "
[Question] How do I find the force on a lever arm when the angle is changing?,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1494707570,True,"I have to make a mousetrap car for my physics class, and I want to know what the optimal length of an arm would be (for distance).

* radius = 0.47 meters    
* tangential velocity = 44.3 m/s    
* angular velocity = 94.25 r/s    

So my design includes a lever arm attached to a spindle, which is connected via a gear to the wheel, this way I can make the car go slow and steady for 10+ meters.

[Question] What is further down the infinite *tunnel* created by two parallel mirrors?,2,10,False,False,False,Physics,1494707858,True,"First of all, we are assuming that the mirrors offer perfect reflection and we have perfect vision - this eliminates the images becoming degraded further down the *tunnel* and too small to see.

I think that I'm correct in saying that each successive image is a fraction of a second behind the last, due to the light having to travel a distance and it not being infinitely fast. So, as you travel further down the tunnel the images will be further and further back in time. This is easy to imagine I think if the mirrors have *always been there* - but still interesting to discuss. I imagine it would look like on of those cheesy webcam filters that lags a moment behind - like motion blur, almost.

But, what if the two mirrors were found on the floor and then placed so that they were parallel to create the *tunnel*? As you travelled down it would you get to the point in time where the two mirrors weren't parallel (they were both lying on the floor)? What would you see at this point? Nothing? A view from the mirror's perspective as it lay on the floor? I think these are both silly answers but I can't think of a good one. Perhaps, the question is silly - but that shouldn't be a reason not to ask.

Evidence we live in a simulation?,13,0,False,False,False,Physics,1494732064,True,"If we lived in a simulation, then there would be there would a discrete length and a period of time which for which there would be no smaller value - that's because there would be a resolution limit to the simulator. Just like the smallest information that we can store on a computer is ultimately a ""bit"" and nothing can be calculated faster than within a single cycle or ""hz"" on a CPU. In order for a computer to simulate anything that took longer than it could within a single cycle, then it would take more cycles hence time.  

Now think about Planck time and Planck length, that which there is no smaller value. The absolute ""resolution"" limit of the simulator.
Everything is in a ""quantum"", that is discrete packets. Just like bits.


What about quantum fluctuations? Where particles apparently appear and disappear - when looking deep enough in a simulation, when we start seeing the limits of it's resolution thus the individual bits being turned on and off - seemingly without any causation. 

The speed of light is the universal time limit, because that is as fast as the simulator can go. So what's with general relativity, where time apparently slows once approaching the speed of light? This is a side effect of a simulator having to do calculation that require more than one cycle. It slows the apparent time from each observers perspective in order to allow it to perform calculations that remain in sync and not have the simulator grind to a halt.

Then the big one - why is there difficulty in trying to meld quantum mechanics and general relativity? Because this is a side effect of being in a simulation - it will only simulate that which is absolutely necessary and able to do within a single ""hz"". When looking at large masses / large distances, it will utilise a ""formula"" to do the calculation thus make physics looks smooth. However when instruments are trained onto those  atoms it will utilise a more precise method to show it's motion/energy that may sometimes seemingly contradicts the macro, but that's because we're running into the resolution limit of how the simulator can store mass/energy. The simulator also has another side effect on the micro - just like it slows time for the very fast and big calculators - it can conversely do calculations ""ahead"" of time - because on a microscopic scale it fits within a ""hz"", hence the weirdness of the double slit experiment where light is seemingly knows ""where"" to go.


This is of course all laymen interpretations of what physics is, and what being in a simulations is like - therefore no calculations or formulas here. But.... possible? =]"

Everything stops and we see him moving graciously in his own frame of reference.

"What is considered matter, what is energy, and what does E=mc2 tell us?",61,44,False,False,False,Physics,1494936681,True,"I'm having trouble understanding matter, energy, particles, and E=mc2. I asked my 11th grade (chemistry and physical science) teacher but he was stumped. Then I went to the internet and found many articles all with different, often contradictory, answers. So here are my questions for you:

- First, what is considered matter? Obviously atoms are (considered matter) so their particles (neutrons, electrons, protons) must be right? So what about gamma rays, photons, and all the other particles not in the atom? How do we classify what is matter vs things like energy, forces, and waves?

- Then, what are particles made of? One thing I've heard is that particles are actually waves bent in on themselves? So what exactly is a wave then and how does that work?

- And for energy, is energy another 'thing' like matter can turn into energy or is matter made up of energy? Or does matter just 'have' energy as a property; similarly to how an electron 'has' a negative charge but 'isn't' a charge and isn't 'made' of charge(s)?

- E=mc2. I know what each letter means (E-energy; m-mass; c-speed of light) but what does this equation show? (and is it totally true or are there circumstances where it doesn't work) Does it calculate the amount of energy in a set amount of mass or how much energy that mass could turn into? (or something else).

- Lastly, when people say something, like an explosion or matter/anti-matter anihilation, ""releases energy"" is it just throwing energy out into the space around it? is it transfering the mass's energy to nearby particles, or releaseing particles that have energy like photons and gamma rays?

TIL: Humans can feel jerk (change in acceleration).,35,5,False,False,False,Physics,1494950645,True,"I had been wondering about that one for years. I couldn't think of an easy experiment to find out because a positive acceleration turns into high speed quite fast. But the other day I finally found my answer when I was visiting an aircraft carrier.
When aircrafts take off from a carrier, they don't use the aircraft engines to accelerate. Or rather, not ONLY. They are ""shot"" using a carrier's system that is like a steam-powered slingshot. It's like a hook that moves along a rail pulling the aircraft forward. The initial acceleration from that slingshot is huge (so much so, that the get tunnel vision from the blood being drained out of their retinas). At the same time, the aircraft engines are at full throttle, but the slingshot's acceleration is much greater. And here comes the interesting part.
When the aircraft has moved past the place where the sligshot's rail ends, pilots say they feel as if suddenly they braked. However, they are still accelerating because the aircraft engines are at full throttle. What they feel is that they suddenly go from being accelerated at the slingshot acceleration a1, to the lower acceleration from the engines a2.
At that moment when they go from a1 -> a2, what they are feeling is the jerk."

What I really want to know is how we can describe the energy in term of particles. Basically, my question applies to every property of a particle like charge, for example. I don't really understand how this works and what is -1 charge, what is +1 charge and why atoms repel and attract and why energy exists and why things move and so on. I know there are some forces between them but again what are forces, how do they exist (they can't be abstract in real world, right? Something has to generate it).

And then he says how is it possible that 2 people witness the same event occur differently, unless time is not absolute. 
What I don't understand is, how does that explain time dilation?
I know it's real, but the way I see it, the reason for second lightning to look like it hit later is because of the speeds, light needed more time to travel to eyes of train passengers than it did to einstein.
If someone is moving away from some sound, and I'm standing still, of course I'm going to hear it first, but that doesn't mean time is different for us, it's just the speed difference, so how does that explain time dilation?

So it might be a silly question but here it goes...

Imagine a four cylender non-turbo engine running. Zooming in on one piston, one can see the intake cycle about to begin. On a non-turbo engine, the intake cycle serves to only fill the cylender with air/fuel, and is not meant to produce power in any way.

Now, the same scenario, but with a turbo-boosted engine this time. The intake valve opens, but this time instead of suction dragging air in, the turbo is forcing air in. Is the positive pressure enough to push the piston down and create a small amount of power (even just enough to cancel out friction) as the piston is in the intake cycle?

Just a thought, it would be cool to know that they produce power in both the power stroke and the intake cycle. Any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading."
Question about helium and energy generation,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1495009082,True,"Hey I know next to nothing about physics so I wanted help from someone to tell me the problems of an idea I had: a tall cilindrical structure that is used to capture the energy of a falling object (let's say bowling balls). Next to it is series of helium balloons lifting objects/bowling balls from the ground and dropping them down the top of the shaft opening (getting the balloon attached to the ball on the ground and getting the balloon to drop the ball into the shaft at the top will be managed by robotic arms) while the detached ballon has its helium sucked out and the deflated balloon dropped into a separate chute back to ground.

"How to calculate bullet velocity from the gunpowder amount, projectile weight, and barrel length",1,3,False,False,False,Physics,1495032774,True,"Hello all!  I have been doing lots of research to find out the initial velocity of a bullet based off of it's propellant amount, projectile weight, and the length of the firearm barrel.  I have found this data for the relationship between velocity and barrel length, when using 5.56x45mm bullets. 

http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/barrel6.jpg

This relationship seems to be logarithmic, generally.  Upon further inspection of the bullet (namely Wikipedia), I found that the case capacity is 1.85 cm^3, and the projectile weight to be 4 grams.  I can deduce that the gunpowder weight should be in the ballpark of 1.85 grams, since most modern gunpowder's density is 1.00 g/cm^3.  The expected velocity is to be around 940 meters/sec, when used with a 508mm barrel.  So, the data compiled looks like:

Propellant weight = 1.83 g or (approx.) 28 gr
Projectile weight = 4.0 g or 63 gr
Barrel length = 508 mm or 20 in

v = 940 m/sec or 3100 ft/sec

Is there any way to take this data, or data like this, to create an equation to find the initial velocity of a bullet?  NOTE: It does not have to be 100% accurate, however, the more accurate the better.

If more information is necessary, I can provide it.  Thank you all!"

I'm a freshman in college, currently studying music composition. I've been a musician for years and I truly love music. I just finished my first semester at a community college, and I've failed pretty badly. No motivation, depression, not quite ready for college blah blah. 

After this semester, I don't really feel like studying music anymore, weirdly. I can just teach myself theory and the like, I don't think a music degree is what I want. 
But now for the physics related part.

3.5 years ago in my first year of highschool I was hit by a car. And a week prior to the car accident I injured myself in a bike accident. The bike accident resulted in a concussion, the car accident resulted in a traumatic brain injury. This put me out of highschool for 3 months, and ultimately I dropped out. My brain was a constant fog and I lost the ability to do math or focus on anything. I can't really read books anymore because I just can't focus. Even typing this is really taking me some time. 
Up until lately, I've just felt that a career in anything but music wouldn't make sense, because I can't do math anymore, and I can' read well. I've blamed everything on my head being messed up. 

I have really bad ADHD, and depression. And recently I have felt a VERY strong urge to study physics all of a sudden? I want to do math again, and feel smart again. I am thinking of getting an ADHD medication and using it to really focus on relearning math. I think I am going to take a semester or two off to really think about what I want to do.

This brings the question: Am I just being impulsive and stupid because of ADHD? Do I actually want to study physics? What are some sources that can test if it's something I actually want to look into? 

TL;DR: Brain injury in highschool, dropped out, in college now but faileed first semester in music due to depression and lack of motivation, bad ADHD can't do math or read anymore because of brain, very sudden urge to study physics and take adhd medication to help focus, how do i know if i actually want this"

Everett Many-Worlds is both Local and Deterministic?,20,0,False,False,False,Physics,1495205416,True,"Many of those educated in the discipline of quantum mechanics may become seduced into the idea that Bell's Inequalities (and its supporting empirical evidence) forever destroy the possibility of determinism coming back into physics.      

However, it may be possible to retrieve both **Locality** and **Determinism** at the same time,  provided we pay a heavy price. The price we pay is quite huge, and it involves having to admit that the universe we experience is one 'branch' of an exploding tree of ""worlds"". All these ""world-lines"" all splitting apart at the forked junctures into a growing plurality of ""realities"".

Does the Everett Many-Worlds Interpretation of QM paint a deterministic physics?   Does the Everett MWI exhibit locality at all interactions?      Perhaps, does it have both at the same time?

flair:Question Boltzmann distribution problem. Is this a reasonably good solution?,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1495257063,True,"HI: 

Im trying to solve the practice problem, I would appreciate any confirmation or corrections. Thanks a lot. 

**Estimate the number of air molecules that strike a surface area A=1cm of the room wall per one second. Assume T=300 K. Gas is 100% N_2.**

Proposed solution: 

No of molecules with velocity vx which strike A in dt is the no of molecules cointained in the cylinder of base area A and length vx*dt.

Total no of molecules in this volume = N/V*(vx *dt) *A

Assuming a maxwell boltzmann distribution of velocities, No of collisions in 1 sec (Nc1s)= 

Nc1s = N/V*A  \int_0^\infty vx p(vx)dvx * \int _0^1 dt

let \alpha be m/(2 *kb *T) so that

Nc1s = N/V *A \int_0^\infty vx e^{-\alpha * vx} dvx

Nc1s = N*A/V 1/2 * \sqrt{2 *kb *T/\(pi *m)}

Assuming P = 1 atm and with PV = N *kb *T we have that 
* N/V = P/(kb*T) = 101325/(1.38*10^-23*300)=2.45*10^25
* A = 1cm^2
* m_{N2}=4.65*10^-26 kg

so finally

Nc1s = 2.91*10^23 collisions

A contradiction in the multi - verse theory.,11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1495313693,True,"If there is only the void before the birth of a universe, and then there is the immediate existence of it, then there can't be any forces acting on the universe other than those within its own propulsion: the minuscule interactions between the smallest units of energy. So, if determinism is true - that being the theory that every interaction between particles is mathematically determined within that first introduction of energy - then there should be the exact same interactions every time, which subsequently produce the universe that follows.

The multi verse argument states that at the onset of the universe, those first introductions of energy are chaotic, and though they do determine all subsequent particular interactions, this is not to say that every universe is the same. If there really are infinitely many universes, then there should be enough so that every possible configuration of particles has occurred - you forgetting to turn your oven off in the morning, along with one where you think you turned it off but didn't, and one wherein you did. 

However, this assumes that the initial production of energy is chaotic and unpredictable - thus prone to different outcomes every time a new universe occurs. But, if there are no outside forces to suggest on the universe, other than those within it, because there was only the void before it, how can there even be differences within that initial surge of energy? The laws of physics suggest it would have to be the same every time. Without existing outside forces to impede, the same interactions would occur, in the same trajectories, every time a universe happens.

If there actually are infinitely many universes, then it's either every possible circumstantial instant has happened, or that every instant in every universe is successively the exact same; that this universe we reside in occurs infinitely many times over, in exactly the same way. If we were in keeping with the laws of physics, then the latter should be the more appropriate. "

"Does measurement reflect reality, or does it only approximate it?",5,3,False,False,False,Physics,1495368972,True,"This is on theoretical terms, not whether you can have perfect precision. I hope this isn't a totally silly question that's relegated to philosophy, considered an impossible question to answer and therefore pointless to ask.

Most of what we know in physics is covered by symmetries that explain preservation of things. Interestingly enough, this is also kind of the foundation of math. The reason, I think, is obvious. If there was a function that preserved nothing, it wouldn't be interesting or worth study. It would also be impossible to describe using our math which is designed around doing all kinds of operations on symmetries. In physics, I think the practical solution is to give something an irrational constant. I wonder if the similar foundations of math and physics leave a bit of circular logic in the latter....

This is what was flowing through my mind today when the question about measurement vs reality came to me, but then something else occurred to me that I haven't heard elsewhere before. Here it is: what if reality wasn't truly geometric? What if geometry only approximated reality? Just as a potential replacement, what if reality was based on connective relationships that you would find in graph theory, as apposed to vectorized relationships that can arise from Euclidean vector spaces that we use to describe most of physics?

Maybe I need a better understanding of reality, experiments inside versus outside of a system, and observed quantum behavior (does it line up with my particle/wave idea? not sure, as I haven't gotten there yet in my studies). Maybe I'm trying to combine too many things at once here.

however- a particle finely balanced on the peak of a sinusoidal potential could have come from anywhere else in the potential, provided it had the right energy to not be moving once it reached the peak. 

Does this mean that newtonian mechanics isnt fully deterministic?"
How can human brains imagine things that are impossible in our universe?,21,0,False,False,False,Physics,1495403328,True,"I don't know if this is a question to ask here, or if this is more like an Astro-Physics or psychology question...

How those reactions can actually generate something that isn't possible, like at this same moment, a man flying and destroying all the walls of my house and creating a black hole at the same time in his hand.

Would a tube filled with grease connected to a pressure sensor dampen a pressure spike?,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1495485102,True,"Let's say you would have a small chamber with a hole in it and a high pressure sensor connected to it. You would like to measure the pressure spike if a firecracker were to explode inside the chamber. Now the sensor is sensitive and you don't want to damage it by placing it directly in the chamber. So the idea is to connect a short tube out of the chamber filled with grease and connect the sensor with the end of the tube.

Now grease is practically not compressible and there would only be a short delay since sound travels fast and the tube is short. My question is: will there be a meaningful dampening of the actual pressure spike (in other words: will I get a lower reading) with the grease tube compared to without?

Intuition would tell me that since grease is not compressible this should not be the case but at the same time it tells me that there should at least be some deviation since we don't live in a perfect world. Does anyone have any thoughts or even better experience on the topic? Considering I'm only making a barely educated guess here any feedback is appreciated. Same goes for any ideas on how you would tackle the problem of not damaging the sensor while still getting as accurate reading of the pressure spike (maximum pressure)."

[Question] Magnetic Field Around Thick Conductors - Railgun Force Modeling Help,5,2,False,False,False,Physics,1495580024,True,"Hello, and thanks in advance for taking a look at my question. This is a duplicate post from Physics Forums, since I'm guessing the number of people who can/will help is pretty small. [Here](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/magnetic-field-computation-from-thick-rectangular-conductor.915531/#post-5768820) is a link to that post. 

-

Generally, I am trying to make a railgun force model. Since railguns depend on the magnetic field created around the rails (and the resulting Lorentz force) I need to model the magnetic field created by the current that flows  through the rails.

-

The problem is, when I compute the magnetic field using my implementation of Biot-Savart, I get something around 2500 T as an average field strength between 0 and 1.2 cm away from a 1 x 1 cm rail carrying 20,000 A of current (I get about 3100 T as a maximum closest to the rail). The magnetic field around a circular conductor (simplification made for a sanity check) is around 0.5 T closest to the ""rail"" when you take both rails into account. I cannot for the life of me figure out this huge discrepancy. I've checked units, I've quadruple-checked all my constants, I've run a mesh refinement analysis, I've even made an animation to show that my indexing is working properly. Perhaps most convincing is that when using another implementation of Biot-Savart (a more simple equation), I get a result pretty close to the simple wire value.
I have no idea what's wrong, and I'm hoping someone can help me out.

-

I should mention that I'm an aerospace engineering student, with a graduate focus in structures...so neither I, nor my advisor, are EM experts.

-

[Here's a simple diagram if you're not familiar with railguns.](http://imgur.com/a/C2pgr)

-
-

I am essentially using Biot-Savart to compute the magnetic field in a discrete armature section (P) from a discrete rail section (P'). I am doing this following equation 2 from [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X11005804) in MATLAB.

-

[Diagram](http://imgur.com/a/bvGSv)
[Equation 2](http://imgur.com/a/mXVPY)

-

To my understanding, this equation shows the magnetic field at an arbitrary point (P: x,y,z) outside the rail. So, to find the magnetic field at each point in the armature, I currently use 5 loops. Two to loop through the rail positions (y' and z' with the long rail dimension being essentially infinite) and three to loop through the armature positions (x, y, z). I am following a test case Here is a block diagram of my current code.

-

[Block Diagram](http://imgur.com/a/wJ2v3)

-

I am computing the integrals as simple sums (midpoint rule, I guess), but I see relatively little change by adjusting mesh size. If this sort of simple integration were a problem, I should see significant and unstable changes with mesh size, correct? Below is the mesh refinement analysis I did, where the average magnetic field is plotted for varying mesh size. As you can see, the one unstable variable is the mesh size of the armature width. As the size gets smaller, more elements get closer to the rail (r goes to 0) and this influences the average more than the other points in the center bring it down. But this doesn't show a problem with this formulation, correct?

-

[Mesh Refinement](http://imgur.com/a/wW5FA)

-

Finally, here are links to my code. The input case I'm running is based off of [this paper](http://pe.org.pl/articles/2016/9/60.pdf). That paper also contains the simplified version of Biot-Savart that seems to be working.

-

The more complicated Biot-Savart implementation I'm interested in fixing is the MATLAB code. The ""Gif"" section at the bottom (and option at the top) are only done to make a movie showing that point P' computes B field at point P, and then loops through all of these values. As I mentioned at the top, this was done to make sure my indexing runs correctly.

The simpler Biot-Savart code is in the Mathematica code (Section ILR1). Everything in this code seems accurate with the exception of a mysterious factor of two in the ILR1 force integral, and the in-progress F1 section.

Additional Question: Even though I'm not currently doing this, I will be adding a temporal loop as well. This will mean the length of rail producing magnetic field will change, and I will need to add a 6th loop to account for discrete rail sections in the x (long) direction. How do I define volumetric current density? The current is not contained in the long (flowing) direction that way. It seems incorrect to just divide current by the length of each section because the current flows that direction. However, I cannot just not divide because then my solution is simply a factor of my mesh size, since the magnetic field contribution from each section gets added together.

--
--

**Update:**
-


I have used MATLAB's integral2 to do the integration now. There are now only 3 loops in the computation. I loop through each armature position, and compute the magnetic field at that point by integrating over the rail sections. The old computation is in the code still for comparison.

-

The answer given by this code is different, but it still does not match up with the simpler wire code, or the simpler Biot-Savart equation. Instead of ~2500 T as an average, I get ~0.0025 T. And yes, most of the values are about a factor of 10^-6 different from the previous values. But, as I said, this doesn't match ~0.5 T that I get from the simpler formulations. Does anyone know why this might be ?

-

I still don't understand why I am getting such smaller values now. I know I was summing up each loop, but I was also dividing by the width and height, so I should get the same answer at the end. Especially since the result is stable with increasing mesh size....

-

Here is the code for the new file:

For convenience, here is a [hyperphysics calculator](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/magcur.html) that does the wire calculation. To get the maximum value, I compute the B field at 0.01m (the width of the rail) and then add the B field at 0.01 + 0.012 m (the width of the second rail, plus the rail separation) to get ~0.5 T (this one actually comes out to ~0.58 T).

--
--

Additionally, I have run an ANSYS Workbench Magnetostatic simulation to check my values further. This gives me yet another result....

-

I made the mistake of using the wrong scale and going a little to detailed with this model, as you'll notice the rail is hollow (this is a way of getting around using a transient solution because in a railgun the current pulse is so fast, it operates like AC current and only travels in the skin of the rail...I'll deal with that in the rest of my analysis later). The reigon of square mesh next to the rail (copper) is the armature (aluminum), and the surrounding area is just air. I have run another version, but the simulation license is now being used by someone else, so I don't have that result to post. If I recall correctly, that result gave even smaller values. As you can see, the magnetic field in the armature is 0.017 to 0.19 T. Sure, this seems to be at least on the same order of magnitude, but, as shown by the second result image, most of the armature is near the low end of this. Yes, the other simulation has smaller values, but not something near what the MATLAB code is getting now (though I'd have trouble trusting that anyway since I believe the simple approximations the most). Would the result be significantly smaller because the Biot-Savart solutions don't consider the magnetic field needing to penetrate another metal?

**Scenario 1**:
A confined resting-still sphere of fluid (ie:water), with unmoving walls. A 3 dimensional drain or ""micro-blackhole"" appeared in the center of the sphere. The unmoving walls are not ""drainable"" and once the fluid is drained/consumed it is removed from the observable area. How would the particles move, and how would the pressure change inside the container from the unmoving walls to the drain.  The drain like a blackhole would force the water inside itself and would always drain at a constant rate.

**Scenario 2**: Same as scenario 1, but instead the fluid observed started out rotating along a single center axis from one pole to the other pole and like scenario 1 the 3D drain / blackhole also appeared in the very center of the observed sphere.

**Scenario 3**:  The observation area is an infinitely high and infinitely deep and infinitely wide ""river of fluid"" moving in constant direction. A 3D Drain or blackhole is placed in this ""river"" how would the particles move around, into, and behind the drain.


What I am looking for, is either people who have done testing on similar scenarios OR if someone knows any references where I can develop my own modeling for these or on 3 dimensional drains.  These examples are not confined to being Outer-space or blackhole related but just the movement observations of point-drain modeling in 3 dimensional space."

In O'Neill cylinders centripetal force is used to substitute gravitational force. If an object is touching the inside of the cylinder it should experience outward acceleration, what concerns me is when an object is not touching the interior surface. If the inside of the cylinder was a vacuum it would make since that for example if a player jumped ""up"" (which is actually inwards) the player would continue in a straight line across the cylinder until they hit the interior surface again. But ideally if people were to live in these cylinders they would be filled with breathable air at atmospheric pressure. An object moving across a pressurized cylinder would experience drag and presumably the air would have rotational momentum as well. Would the air inside a spinning O'Neil cylinder impart a outward force on the objects in the cylinder as well only weaker? Or would the drag push objects moving inward with the rotation? Or both? I'm not really sure how to model this for my game.

How to correctly represent data when the error bars are very small?,12,12,False,False,False,Physics,1495667369,True,"Hello all,

I was preparing some plots for a presentation and I have the following question:

When you have data points affected by experimental error (in this case in the y axis) what is the correct way of representing them if the error bars are of the same size of the point. I was taught that usually we should reduce the symbol size to ensure that we see, clearly, the size of the error bars. My problem is that I have error bars that are too small and the problem cannot be fixed by reducing the symbol size (see links 1 and 2).

Time defined based on quantum events?,6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1495682329,True,"I'm a CS guy who only has surface knowledge of more advanced physics but I've had several ideas rattling around in my head that I was hoping to hear if they are plausible etc.

One is time being defined based on quantum events.

When I hear if the dual slit experiment I typically hear of an electron moving through space then going through both slits if it can't be detected then creating the interference pattern.

The treatment of the electron here is as if it moves through space.

But why talk about something moving through space when seemingly the cause of the quantum effect here is related to the quantum particle's immeasurability?

Why not instead say the quantum particle has a velocity and the next tick of time of the universe is the next quantum interaction (possibly also relative)?

I kind of imagine quantum particles searching for their next interaction points and the universe ticking forward. When writing a simple simulation of ""what stop lights will a car stop at"", you don't tick through every second, you just jump forward to the next event.

This may be basic or hair brained but it's something I think about a lot. 😀"

Force in Newtonian gravity vs Einsteins gravity,12,1,False,False,False,Physics,1495710336,True,"Hey peeps. 

So I found myself thinking about more quirky aspects of relativity. 

Suppose i have a massive object somewhere in space and I have a much smaller object going in orbits around the big one. 

As far as I understand, there is no difference between Newtonian gravity model and Einsteins gravity model when it comes to the FORCE exerted on the small object by the big one. Yes, how that force is modeled, whether it is a force or curvature in space time differs, but the numerical answer should be the same. 

What I mean is that the centrepital acceleration will be the same in both theories, regardless of distance between the two or the velocity of one relative to the other. 

Where it differs is that if the distance is small enough, the small object will have to travel at a very high speed in order to maintain an orbit. If that speed is very high, the whole, ""the closer to light speed , the more energy you need to gain more speed"" effect becomes more apparent. 

So the small object will have different amount of total energy if one is to compare the two theories, but the force exerted on the small object as seen by an observer at rest should be the same no matter whether you use Newtonian or Einsteins model. So it should always be proportional to 1/r^2.  Am I correct? "

Which equation to use when calculating initial velocity of a bullet?,11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1495752202,True,"About a week or so ago, I had asked this question: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/6bp6ew/how_to_calculate_bullet_velocity_from_the/

In short, I am trying to figure out the initial velocity of a bullet from only knowing the the amount of gunpowder (grams), projectile weight (grams), and length of the barrel (mm).

Since my last post, I have been playing with several equations to try and figure out the solution.  The reply that I got entailed figuring out how many moles of gas were released by the gunpowder, finding out how hot that gas is, and calculating what the pressure in the chamber was; and from there, with a little modification for the barrel length, find the velocity of your bullet.  If necessary, I can also use the diameter of the bullet.

However, I've been trying to brainstorm the best approach for this problem.  So far, I have deduced this:

.01538 moles of gas per gram of gunpowder
3000 joules expelled per gram of gunpowder

And I'm guessing on the following:

I should use Heat Energy Formula (h = cp * m * (tf - ti)) to determine what the change in temperature is

For reference:

Air heat capacity is 1.012 jg/k
Air density is 1.225 g/cm^3

Now, I've been torn between using the Ideal Gas formula (PV = nRT) or Gay-Lussac's law (P1 / T1 = P2 / T2).  Both of these are capable of telling the pressure, however, I'm lost as to what to do from there.  Not really any of my next anticipated steps account for the mass of the bullet, however I am fairly certain that the projectile mass needs to be accounted for somewhere.

Any help is really appreciated, thank you!"

Quantum entanglement and randomly chosen vectors from a sphere,12,11,False,False,False,Physics,1495896209,True,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v657Ylwh-_k

I was watching this video, and I had an idea that is probably wrong but I don't know why. 

So in the video it is talking about quantum entanglement experiments.  It goes through an explanation that treats x (rotation about x detector) and y (rotation about y detector) as totally independent variables, both of which have a correlation with d which detects rotation about an axis some angle between x and y.  

It says classical mechanics would predict a linear relationship between the angles of the detectors, and the probability of them having opposite spins.  

In my mind, this classical version is mathematically (and seemingly logically) equivalent to taking a random vector/point on a circle and determining whether it is on one side or the other of a certain line.

However, since there are 3 degrees of freedom for a particle, it only makes sense that you would instead randomly pick your vector/point from a sphere.  This would seem to change the probability distribution.  If you have measured a particle in one dimension, the set of possible points on the sphere that could result in x but not d versus x and d seem like they would be in different proportions on a sphere than a circle.  

Can someone help me out?"

An inquiry into our ability to understand the universe and into the future of physics,11,16,False,False,False,Physics,1495903192,True,"I was recently accepted to Princeton and I am about to embark on a career in physics. I have a few months off before I start, and I have thus started thinking about the nature of the subject. Do you, physicists, ever think that, just like (say) a cat is unable to understand an integral, that we might be unable to understand the universe? Does this ever discourage you from your quest?

Also, as I understand it, we are unable to test many of the modern theories in physics. Hawking, for example, has recently said the following (on his essay on [The Nature of Space and Time] (https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9409195)):

> But string theory, at least at its current state of development, is quite incapable of making these predictions except by appealing to general relativity as the low energy effective theory. I suspect this may always be the case and that there may not be any observable predictions of string theory that can not also be predicted from general relativity or supergravity. If this is true it raises the question of whether string theory is a genuine scientific theory. Is mathematical beauty and completeness enough in the absence of distinctive observationally tested predictions? Not that string theory in its present form is either beautiful or complete.

What does this mean for the future of physics? *Is* mathematical beauty and completeness enough in the absence of distinctive observationally tested predictions?

Any thoughts are appreciated. Thank you for your help!"

Understanding the measurement of GaN nanowire (NW) Q factors using an electron beam,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1495932227,True,"I should first mention that I am researching GaN NWs within the area of mass sensing applications as a novice undergraduate student. This question is a way for me to learn how to independently vet scientific research and how to proceed from there.

I stumbled upon this paper that proposes a theory to measure the amplitude of GaN NW oscillations. Immediately at the beginning of the paper, they assume the form of the position of the center of oscillation to the electron beam as A*sin(wt). Then, they continue with this to arrive at an expression for the Q-factor. Is this not already incorrect because damping is not taken into account in position? The assumption they make do not answer this, as far as I can see.

The only difference in these equations of course is that for energy, the radius term is not squared, and so a different answer would result.  Why does it not work to take the energy approach? Wouldn't gravities cancel if an o next at that point experienced equal potential energy to 2 different masses?"

Things more massive do fall faster?,25,15,False,False,False,Physics,1496118806,True,"A common misconception amongst the average individual is that things heavier or more massive things fall faster towards earth than lighter things. So based on average observations, heavier things and lighter things will reach the ground at different times.

Of course...this isn't true......or is it?

Since the explanation of why they fall at the same rate is given idealistically with excluding air resistance, small variations in earth's mass etc..., let's analyze this idealistically too.

>> F = G(m1\*m2)/(r^2)

You have two balls. One is 10kg and the other is 500kg. (Scenario 1 and 2 respectively). Both held at the same height and treated like particles.

Ok so assuming earth's mass is constant and the radii are the same, acceleration toward earth is:

>> a1 = G\*(m1)/(r^2) 

where m1 is earth mass and r is the radius from earth's center to the center of the ball (G is newton's gravitational constant). This comes out to be about 9.81 m/s^2 as expected which is idealistically the same for both scenarios.

BUT. what is ""falling"". In physical terms this is the two bodies coming into contact with each other. In real-life scenarios we consider the earth to be perfectly still and the ball moving toward earth..however this isn't the case.

Earth is accelerating towards the balls too:

>> a2 = G\*(m2)/(r^2) 

Where m2 is the mass of the ball this time. Since the mass of the second ball is more, the earth accelerates a tiny bit more towards the second ball than the first one. This means it takes less time for the second ball to ""fall.""

So really, I'm thinking that our explanation is not good enough since our explanation of things falling at the same time is really a very specialized case when you have two inproportionate masses where one practically stays still. Or at least, it shouldn't be which one ""falls first"" but solely left to which ball accelerates faster towards earth (which excludes earth's acceleration towards the ball).

This version excludes time to fall from the equation and properly describes the idealistic scenario in which both balls accelerate towards the earth at the same rate."

"Speculative question about antimatter, baryon asymmetry, and the second law of thermodynamics",4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1496121261,True,"Hi, while doing some work, I came across the wiki page for [on shell and off shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_shell_and_off_shell). This paragraph raised my interest:

>When speaking of the propagator, negative values for E that satisfy the equation are thought of as being on shell, though the classical theory does not allow negative values for the energy of a particle. This is because the propagator incorporates into one expression the cases in which the particle carries energy in one direction, and in which its antiparticle carries energy in the other direction; negative and positive on-shell E then simply represent opposing flows of positive energy.

We have a noticeable baryon asymmetry in our universe. We also have a noticeable asymmetry in the production of entropy, described by the second law of thermodynamics. Further, we can think of antimatter as energy flowing back in time, as we do in Feynman diagrams (my prof never went into detail on this interpretation). Does it then make sense to ask if the reason we don't observe antimatter on average is related to why we don't observe negative entropy production on average? After all, the second law is a source of asymmetry in T, which results in CP violation by the CPT theorem, and strong CP violation can explain baryon asymmetry.

Calculating initial velocity accurately,0,2,False,False,False,Physics,1496149446,True,"Hello all!

Right now, I have a ballistics equation that I've been piecing together for calculating the muzzle velocity of a bullet.  Right now, it won't account for friction or how aerodynamic the bullet is.  I'm wondering three things;

1.  Is it necessary to account for how aerodynamic the bullet is?  We are calculating muzzle velocity, that being how fast the bullet is when it leaves the rifle.

2.  How should one go about calculating friction?  I was told to do some research about a coefficient of friction, and yet, nothing gives me accurate results.

3.  Should it be necessary to need to account for burn time of the propellant, if we use different propellants?

Here's the equation I have at the moment (programmer friendly!):

((2*((309.436122*(3.1415*(D/2)^2)-(101.325*3.1415*(D/2)^2))/W)*L))^(1/2)

Where...

D = Diameter of bullet
W = Mass of bullet
L = Length of firearm barrel
309.436122 = ""Gunpowder pressure constant""

The equation combines the Ideal Gas equation, Newton's second law, and the Heat Energy formula.

Any help is appreciated.  Thank you!

Gunpowder pressure constant explained:

So, if we have one gram of gunpowder (which has a density of 1.00 g/cm^3), it would release 1.538E-2 moles of gas in an area of one cm^3.  If we double the mass of our gunpowder, it would release twice as much gas in twice as much area; therefore, the pressure does not change."

Questions about Gas laws.,3,3,False,False,False,Physics,1496177710,True,"Sometime this week I will be demonstrating an example of Boyle's law and Gay-Lussac's law for a small class project. I will be using a fire piston to ignite different objects:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_piston

I've been doing some calculations, and I want to know if I missed something.

I would start with the piston at 5 cm^3, at 1atm (not sure how our elevation affects it, my watch has a barometer), and a room temperature of 300K.

Wikipedia and my teacher tell me that P1*V1=P2*V2.

1 atm * 5 cm^3 = 5 atm * 1  cm^3

So I predict that the pressure would be 5 atm.
Wikipedia (and my teacher) tell me that, according to Gay-Lussac's law:

P1/T1 = P2/T2

So...

1atm/300K = 5atm/1500K 

1500K = 1227C

That seems a bit excessive to be produced just by smacking down a piston, is it realistic or did I miss something?

Thanks."

In the school that I go right now, the Ib system starts way earlier so we can take AP classes for 10th grade. Well I like biology and chemistry but I loved physics. So I decided to apply for ap physics. The thing is that when i came into the school they placed me to algebra 1 extended for no reason , while the requirement for physics is higher. Another thing is that I never study and get 8/8 on my math tests and 7/7 on my quarter grade for math. If I really wanted to take ap physics maybe I could, but i dont know how hard it will be because i was pushed back in math for 1 year.

Physics Grad School as a Math Undergrad,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1496247419,True,"WARNING: You'll be making a hefty time investment by reading this post, and while I appreciate anyone who wants to stick around and give some advice, I certainly don't want to waste those people's time who have no interest. 

Alright alright alright, so the story goes like this: Last year I was a freshman math/physics double major in the honors program at a top 40 research institution, but unfortunately, as I was strongly disliking both the culture and the cost of said institution, I applied for transfer to a number of different schools for my sophomore year, starting this fall of 2017. After sitting on various waitlists for a month, I've decided to cut my losses and enroll at a local public university that is, luckily for me, consistently ranked inside the top 10 (even though this is a bullshit measure) for graduate physics programs. The struggle I'm having is that I will no longer be able to complete the double major in both physics and math in 4 years due to complications including, but not limited to, varying AP score and graduation requirements. I ultimately want to study theoretical/mathematical physics in graduate school, but as I'm much, MUCH further along in the math major than the physics, I'm contemplating just minoring in physics so that I don't have to stick around for an extra year of tuition. 

My main question is, if I strive to become involved in these really prestigious physics research groups on campus, slay the Physics GRE, and take some higher level physics courses but skip a few of the major req's, will my lack of the physics major still impede my ability to be admitted to top graduate programs?

Is it possible to find periodic solution ins the frictionless double (or n-) pendulum?,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1496268801,True,"Today I made some simulations in Mathematica of n-pendulums. I friend suggested to try and find periodic solutions.(The idea came from a recent post here with periodic solutions of the gravitational 3-body problem.).

First I wanted to ask - do such orbits exist?
Because maybe I am getting something very wrong here? Is there a clever way of doing this?

My idea was to start with random initial conditions for the angle and angular momentum of each pendulum. Then numerically solve these solutions. Then compare endpoint of the trajectory to the initial conditions. If they don't match I could try to move the initial conditions slightly to the end result and see, if the distance of end and start gets smaller then.
I am not quite sure about the whole thing.

Would it also be practical, to first start solving the differential equations (here euler lagrange) with a bunch of random initial conditions and then see if the solutions cross each other? 
But the thing is, that trajectories in phase space don't cross... that's one of its features. 
I suspect that the maybe the double pendulum might just not have periodic orbits. Like out of principle. Could i be right?
Maybe someone here has done something similar? Has some insight?

Paper 1 problems (mainly multiple-choice concept problems) are very hard for me, but Paper 2 problems (many are Math plug-and-chug questions) are easy unless they involve concepts - such as abstract or ""more involved"" word problems (like a force diagram but not accounting for normal force properly when there's an applied force at an angle, as a simple example).

I've been using the Tsokos IB Physics textbook and doing problems in that book previously, but now I'm using a combination of multiple textbooks (Tsokos, Pearson, Oxford, Giancolli) on each topic. The typical textbook problems are okay because the concepts used are specifically mentioned in the textbooks, but Tsoko's IB ""exam-style"" questions involve different ways of looking at the question that are very specific to that problem. As such, I feel like those textbooks aren't enough as these similar harder-in-difficulty IB (QuestionBank) questions released by IB that I also practice on involve concepts that were never explained specifically in any of those textbooks or involved in any of their practice questions.

I was puzzled by this video in which two balls are thrown at the same speed, one into a straght path and the second into a circular path. The result is that the one going in a circle was slown down by a factor of Pi/4.

I believe I have understood the trick : the ball going in the circle is actually *rolling* along the wall. Hence, there is an hidden cycloidal motion : a point of the surface of the ball is moving a distance of 8*r when the ball is moving a distance of 2*Pi*r.

In the end there is 2 relevant notion of distance : the distance traveled by the center of mass, as if an object is gliding, and the distance traveled by it's points, as if the object is rolling.

Now, in the case of an arbitrary curve, does the rolling distance boil down to manhattan distance, or is it just complicated? Or should we just re evaluate the distance by 4/pi ? It seems like any change of direction would cause a ball to turn around itself at the same time."

Question about permittivity in EM (milfors) vs Optics,8,2,False,False,False,Physics,1496565219,True,"Hello

I've been studying electromagnetism and optics this semester as part of my degree, in different courses. Doing so, I've found some confusing uses of electromagnetic parameters in order to arrive to wave expressions in materials:

-In optics: we start with Maxwell equations in materials, width D, E, H, B and p and J free. We some transformations to get them to the non--sources form, where the generalized electric permittivity appears (eg = e - ig/w) instead of the usual e. e, eg, polarizability X are assumed to be complex.

-In EM (using Milford): we start with Maxwell Equations with sources, arrive at wave equation and then Helmholtz equation, we solve it. But here, e, mu, g etc are always assumed to be real, and eg does not appear explicitly


My question is: can electric permittivity (not generalized), polarizability etc be not real? Why in Milford is assumed to be real (chapter 15, plane waves in conducting media, when calculating gamma (E=E0•exp(-gamma*z)*exp(iwt)) )

Thank you"

Isothermal work done by real gases when pressure is the known variable.,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1496573037,True,"Hello,
I have recently encountered a problem, which asked to calculate the isothermal work done by one mole of real gases, when the only two known variables were the temperature T, initial and final pressures (p1 and p2). Now this would be an easy problem were the known variables V1 and V2.

My approach:

dA = pdV (1)

p = RT/(V - b) - a/V^2 (2)

substituting (2) into (1) and integrating from V1 to V2

A = RTln((V1 - b)/(V2 - b)) + a/V1 - a/V2; (3)

Now this is were the issue comes in

The real gas equation is

(p + a/V^2)(V - b) = RT; (4)

upon expanding this you get

pV^3 - (pb + RT)V^2 + aV - ab = 0; (5)

Now this is a 3rd degree polynomial. If my known variable is pressure, do i just find the solutions to this polynomial and insert into (3) or is there some more clever way to go about it?

Can't decide between maths and physics,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1496689805,True,"Context:  I'm majoring in CS, final year, and wanted to pursue research. However, I don't like almost all the fields, and the ones I do are more interesting to work with a full maths background, so I decided to get another major, but I can't decide between physics and maths. I've always loved both, but I've always been better with maths, given that my physical intuition was not always the best nor trained to improve and that my maths intuition was always better. Given this, I figured I'd post in both subreddits (maths and physics, hope that's ok), asking for advice regarding this question, as I've been struggling with this for almost a year now, talked to several people (professors included) and being that I've really tried to think about this in a lot of ways, just to be even more divided between both. 
This call for help is in hope someone can maybe raise a new perspective or question that can help me. I hope I'm being reasonable about this ""call for help"", but I can't tell as I'm really desperate (and running out of time). 
My knowledge in physics doesn't go beyond E&M at undergrad level, with mechanics thrown around (I've learned some of the undergrad level stuff during the E&M course), and I've done pretty good at it. I know the areas of physics and interdependencies between them and all that, know all the buzzwords, but, of course, it's all really superficial (I've done a few peeks into the maths, however). Some of the fields I've found particularly interesting (from hearing talking about from a close, knowledgeable friend who's majoring in physics) are condensed matter ( which my faculty excels at), optics (same, and I have a big part of my family working in that business), particle physics and theoretical physics in general (I know, I know...).
I really hope the question isn't too vague and that I'm being clear. Something that can help answering this would be stuff like:
- What research fields are active?
- How hard is a research career to get/maintain in physics?
- What can I expect from a physics major at a decent university?
- I know it's silly, but I'm really desperate and think this can make some sense: how can I know if I'm ""cut out"" for physics?
- What should I be asking myself in order to evaluate which route to take?
Again, I'm sorry for being vague and for the long text, but I've tried a lot of stuff, talked to some people (I'll try and talk to even more), spend so much time in this, but it's really hard and time's running out on me. Thank you in advance for the help.

What is the freezing point of beer?,5,2,False,False,False,Physics,1496695712,True,"I know this may sound like a very silly question, but I just got back from a trip to Amsterdam where I had the pleasure of visiting the [Ice Bar](http://www.xtracold.com/). The temperature inside the ice bar is -10^o C, and my friend told me that the beer is chilled to -12^o C. It was a very fun experience, and being the physics nerd that I am, I wondered why the beer I was served didn't freeze.

My hypothesis is that since beer is a mixture, its freezing point must be lower than that of water (which was evidently the case since I didn't end up with frozen beer!). I am familiar with the colligative properties of solutions (including that of lowering the freezing point of a solution), and I believe that these properties may be extended to homogeneous mixtures such as beer. Is this the case? If not, why did my beer not freeze? If this is the case, how would I go about estimating the freezing point of beer (specifically Heineken)?"

I have 100 pages of hand-written notes containing what seems to be a unified theory of physics - what do I do with it?,217,285,False,False,False,Physics,1496724269,True,"I have inherited ~ 100 pages of handwritten notes from my late father. Initially I didn't think much of it, but the more I study it, the more it seems like a unified theory of physics. My dad's pride and joy was a formula he derived for the gravitational constant.

I've taken it to a couple of professors, who suggested I get it written professionally and copyrighted. I don't plan on doing this any time soon because a) I can't afford it and b) I don't think someone else would understand my dad's notes better than me.

I know it's hard to believe that this is anything of value. But humor me, if it is, what should I do with it?

Or more precisely, if I were to type it up neatly into a document, where would I submit it to?

Edit: Here is [my dad's formula for G](http://imgur.com/i66cTuN), that he derived. The image also shows how the value compares to a recent experimental value for G. Alpha is the fine structure constant and pi and e are just mathematical constants. What is n? It's very hard to explain. It's basically a new feature for any subatomic particle (my dad called it an ""inner characteristic""). There are dozens of pages that lead up to the derivation of this formula. I just wanted to share this because it's pretty neat and no one else in my family has really understood the significance. Also, thanks to everyone so far for giving me tips.

Edit 2: Oops, forgot to link to the [article with the experimental value for G](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v510/n7506/full/nature13433.html).

Edit 3: I appreciate all the comments. A lot of good points were brought up. I was well aware of the issue with units (it actually discouraged me from studying his work in the first place). Looking at the formulas closely, however, it appears that this final G formula is the only one with this problem. I'm going to (try) to share a bit about the derivation. Maybe this will shed some light on what's going on with the units.

I *believe* that the formula for G is intimately connected with another general formula for an Energy field.

My dad wrote, if F(n) is the flux of kinetic energy of a particle then the energy's field will be equal to its kinetic energy multiplied with the corresponding field (in this case from n0->n1). The equation shows: E-field = E-kin * F(n)

When he later derives G, it has to do with the gravitational field as it relates to the formula for E-field.

Also, as I responded to someone already, a part of the derivation is G = [x/(ε_0 * c]^2 multiplied by a function F(n) cubed (I believe F(n) has the units eV * m).

Why is the final formula only full of dimensionless numbers? I honestly don't know. n-min is referred to many times in his work and only at the very end does the value sqrt(1-alpha^2) come into play.

As for my motives, they are mixed. I do want to honor his work, but I also want him to get recognition for this if it is due. I will probably do as some people mentioned and share this with you guys on a later date. I appreciate the encouragement you guys gave me. "

Also I read on wiki 
""In a larger sense, the theory suggests that the entire universe can be seen as two-dimensional information on the cosmological horizon, the event horizon from which information may still be gathered and not lost due to the natural limitations of spacetime supporting a black hole, an observer and a given setting of these specific elements,[clarification needed] such that the three dimensions we observe are an effective description only at macroscopic scales and at low energies.

Question regarding time dilation and the light speed limit .,111,31,False,False,False,Physics,1496776746,True,"Lets say I move really fast, or I go near a gravity source that is very great. We can get into a situation where for every 1 hour I'm experiencing you are experiencing 100 hours. Right? 

So.... in that circumstance couldn't it appear to me as if things you are doing are happening faster than light? 

Like in the movie Interstellar they say 1 hour for the woman on that planet = 7 years on Earth. 

So, everything on Earth would appear to be traveling 61,320 times faster than it is actually traveling? That means a satellite orbiting at 40,000 miles per hour would appear to be orbiting at 2.4 billion miles per hour. Right? 

That is faster than the speed of light.  How does this work? Does the Satellite begin appearing as a probability wave form instead of as a physical object? and only when we measure it's position does the waveform collapse and then give us some specific position for that ""moment"" but then it vanishes again, as per the uncertainty principle?

I am running a photoelectric effect experiment to determine the work function of a certain material on a plate of samples, so I do not think I need 10^(-9) torr, and do not think that non-UHV solder will outgas enough to make the vacuum too low to run the experiment.

What's the best opportunity for me when I have good research experience but a low GPA(but was rising in my last few semesters)?,4,2,False,False,False,Physics,1496857989,True,"Hi everyone, I have a few questions with regards with my physics career.
First to give some context: A large part of my GPA is so low is because of my background. I didn't really have good parents and been independent for most of my life.

I recently graduated with my physics degree back in May but my journey through college was a bit volatile. It took me 6+ years to get my degree, and my first half of my college journey was my dealing with my issues from my past. I went to therapy, got counseling, and really worked on my mental health. After 3 years or so, something finally ""clicked"". I realized that I needed to take control of my life and I wasn't going to let my anxieties take control.

The thing is I had three years worth of credits with barely a 2.0 GPA, but I refused to give up. The next few years after that I went into this mentality of trying to get every accomplishment I possibly could to make up for it. I got into a research lab in condensed matter physics, got two scholarships for my research, presented it, got on my schools rocket team and also played a contributing factor to that. I also learned how to code to help me aid in physics.
My latest project was solving schroedinger's equation for an infinite square well through the shooting method. I then assembled the code to do first order energy shifts through pertubration theory(with two particles with the same mass, but non identical), and then later upgraded the code to deal with the spin 1/2 and spin 1 and deal with the effects of Pauli Exclusion.

Along with this I worked some semesters full time outside of school. Financial aid gave some help, but it wasn't enough. After all of it was done, my GPA ended at 2.8

Which is why I'm really frustrated. My low GPA isn't because I was partying or slacking off. I was dealing with issues from my past, and when they were solved and I reached a good mental state, I did everything in my power to make me a good physicist. A lot of the jobs I see have a minimum GPA requirement of 3.0 and immediately kick my application through a computer system and I don't know what to do.

Reading many job descriptions I think I do have the skills to do them, because I can program at a decent level, have good grades in my higher level physics classes, my GPA from the past 2-3 years is definitely above a 3.0, and developed a lot of skills from my research lab, and also have professors that can back my skills, but I can't even get an interview.
If anyone has any advice or programs that aren't so stringent on a GPA could they help me out? Possibly any work for the national labs. I want to get my PhD, but this just seems like a very hard wall to overcome.
Thank you"

Each time the quantum field collapses you either get shot in the head or not. This doesn't mean that time stops passing, eventually you would age and die. Not getting shot in the head doesn't mean you're immortal.
 Am I missing something? The whole suggestion just irritates me honestly as It seems like this is an obvious error in the logic."

Does anyone else think that fidget spinners are a great way to demonstrate some basic physics principles?,7,10,False,False,False,Physics,1497018144,True,"For anyone unfamiliar, [this is a fidget spinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWN5XfQWUQw). People love to hate these things because all the kids these days are playing with them; however, this recent craze presents a unique opportunity to introduce people to some basic physics! 

For instance, often times it's quite difficult to demonstrate how angular momentum, torque, and angular velocity manifest themselves without getting up on a turn table and holding a bike wheel. Fidget spinners may help elucidate these concepts; when playing with a fidget spinner you can actually feel the resistance that comes about when changing it's orientation (it's angular momentum vector), additionally, you can demonstrate precession by perturbing its angular momentum relative to it's angular velocity. 

I'm sure there are other demonstrations that may be done with these toys as well. "

Putting your head on the ground so the earth absorbs the EM radiation in your body.,15,0,False,False,False,Physics,1497023441,True,"So I was sent this by a friend and would like some of your thoughts on this: 

Our body receives a huge amount of electromagnetic waves daily from electrical equipment which have become indispensable part of our lives. These also include equipment such as street lights over which we have no control. As result we are charged with electromagnetic waves round the clock causing problems such as headache, feeling of uncomfortable, laziness and at times pain. The question is how we overcome this inevitable modern day problem. A non Muslim scientist in Europe who had done extensive research into this issue concluded that the best way to remove the positive electromagneticcharge which hurts the body is by placing the forehead on the ground. This helps discharge the harmful positive electromagnetic charges.

In fact this is somewhat similar to the grounding of the buildings where any positive electromagnetic signals such as thunder discharged through the ground. According to this research and findings the best way to put the forehead on the ground is by positioning to the centre of the earth."

Free Classical Physics Udemy Course,39,6,False,False,False,Physics,1497028657,True,"Hey guys! About ~2 weeks ago, I released a new physics course on Udemy (check out the trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV3Vp7EY3QM&lc=z12mttzanxyxcpb1s22cyzsz2xfui5p1n), and I've decided to give away a limited number of free copies (100 in total for now; I'll update the thread when they're all gone). So, if any of you find interest in this, please send me a PM, and I'll send over a free coupon when I get a chance. This would be a perfect course to brush up on your physics during the summer.

 

Why am I giving it away for free, you ask? At this point, I've already recovered all sunk costs spent to actually make the course. So, I want to now focus on helping as many people as possible. I absolutely love teaching others and sharing my interests with the world, and the opportunity to motivate/inspire so many people is absolutely amazing. If you do end up attending and making progress in the course, please leave a kind review/rating - such that others can more easily find the course :).

Help with transforming momentum vector under a change of coordinates,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1497229207,True,"I am reading the proof of Noether's theorem in Nakahara's ""Geometry, Topology, and Physics,"" (section 1.1.3, ed. 2), and am having trouble understanding how to transform the momentum vector under a change of coordinates. [;q_k;] and [;p_k;] are generalized coordinates and momenta, respectively. We consider a new set of coordinates given by 

[;q'_k = q_k + \epsilon f_k(q);].
The Jacobian associated with the coordinate change is

[;\Lambda_{ij} = \frac{\partial q'_i}{\partial q_j} \approx \delta_i_j + \epsilon \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial q_j};]

[side question: why is that last relation approximate? It appears exact to me]
I am confused in the following step, where Nakahara says that the momentum transforms as

[; p_i \rightarrow \sum_j{p_j (\Lambda_j_i)};] where the ([;\Lambda_j_i;]) should be (the inverse of [;\Lambda_j_i;]) (sorry Latex is giving me trouble).



I don't understand where this comes from. It reminds me of coordinate transformations for covarient or contravarient vectors, however, I cannot figure exactly what is going on here. Is [;p_i;] covarient or contravarient (or neither?). Where does the inverse on the [;\Lambda_j_i;] come from?

So, i was looking at some bad clickbait about negative temperatures, learnt a little about them thanks to Sixty Symbols, and then a question crossed my mind when thinking about absolute zero and low temperatures.

If low temperatures mean less kinetic energy, and kinetic energy is movement, does reference frame affect temperatures?

My thought process was: Let's suppose researchers get a gas close to absolute zero. That would mean the atoms in the gas are barely moving. Using the typical example of putting those researchers and the gas in a train and observing the train from the station, for the observer in the station those atoms are in movement and have a higher kinetic energy and therefore, should have a higher temperature.

So i tried to answer my question with little success
Best google result was Quora where i found ""yes"", ""no"" and ""we don't really know"" for answer.

Worsening my question, answers that said that ""yes"" talked about the object actually being cooler for the outside observer, that's where i called quit and came here; why an object that is moving fast would appear cooler? shouldn't it be the opposite? 

Someone mentions that high velocity moving object have little ""average molecular motion"" and therefore, lower temperatures. Is there anything i can read on this?

Physics vs. Engineering degree,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1497365228,True,[deleted]
[Question] Physics vs. Engineering (EE) degree,7,10,False,False,False,Physics,1497365846,True,"Hello reddit, I hope this is the right place to post this. I am 19 yrs old and will be a sophomore in University this fall.

So within the past 3-4 years, I've been super intrigued by physics and math for a career path. Back in high school I never really thought what I'd actually major in, and last year I thought that I decided on Electrical Engineering. The idea of using physics, especially electromagnetism, really seemed cool. But the more I think about it and the more I research, I'm not too sure that's what I actually want to do.

I've thought very frequently of getting a physics degree, but I've read and heard around that a Ph.D or at least a Master's is usually needed to find work... and I don't want to be in academia. Money has never been my main drive for a career, but making a good amount is somewhat important to me, as I'd like to live comfortably and pay debt back in a somewhat timely manner.

So I guess my question is is this true about physics degrees? Another reason for picking EE is that I could go to grad school if I chose to, but I wasn't forced. It seems that if I major in physics, it's almost a requirement, but then I'd have more options as to the specific field. 

Another thing - my school offers a physics degree with:

Professional physics

Engineering

Biology

Teaching

Computation

I just thought it would be some useful information.

Any advice or insight on the subject would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if I need to clarify anything. Thanks!

**TL;DR: I have decided on an engineering degree in the past due to my interest in physics and math. But recently, I feel like I don't actually want to be an engineer and have been thinking about a physics degree, would this be a good choice for a career that IS NOT academia?**"

I know that the faster you travel you will experience time differently then someone who is not traveling as fast. The theory of relativity proved this. So I watched a small scale test where one person was moving left to right on stage with a flash light. While the audience stood still in the seats. As the guy moved left to right on stage he moved the flash light up and down. For him the flashlight moved a small distance while for the audience the flashlight moved a larger distance. Obviously his movement on stage is so small scale that we won't notice a difference in time. Either way I'm sure you guys understand the concept. Now for my question that has been bothering me. Two people, one person is on earth while the other is traveling at the speed of light through space. Theoretically speaking, if you were able to send a message to the person traveling at the speed of light instantaniously every minute to measure time how would that show itself? Since both parties have the same concept of time and can count every second that passes how will the time travel show itself?"

Can we consider/examine/track two indistinguishable particles as separate entities?,6,2,False,False,False,Physics,1497395647,True,"This discussion came up in another thread about plasmas, where another commenter offhandedly remarked that when a plasma was cooled down, the same (neutral) atoms would be regenerated, but with the electrons on different atoms.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/6gwwf9/question_do_plasmas_maintain_their_atomic_identity/) is the thread, and it is the [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/6gwwf9/question_do_plasmas_maintain_their_atomic_identity/ditq8ax/).

There were significant objections to that part of the comment, saying that because electrons are indistinguishable particles, it is meaningless to say that electrons have switched atoms/nuclei.  I didn't see how that was so, and [described a thought experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/6gwwf9/question_do_plasmas_maintain_their_atomic_identity/ditui3y/) in which we remove one electron from each of two atoms and put it on the other.  It is of course true that the initial and final states of this pair of two neutral atoms are identical and indistinguishable, but it's not clear to me that it is therefore meaningless to say that we interchanged two electrons.

It becomes more clear (to me) when we talk about slightly larger objects, rather than fundamental particles like electrons.  The example I gave is two argon atoms on a surface, observed (and manipulated) by STM.  [This video](https://youtu.be/oSCX78-8-q0) by IBM is the kind of thing I mean, even though those are actually CO molecules.  If we have two atoms on the surface and we nudge them around until they have switched places, it seems to me that, well, the atoms have switched places.  And again, I fully realize that the initial and final states are identical (that's part of the point), but that doesn't mean we haven't switched the two atoms around.

We can take this to extremes and consider two identical protein molecules containing many thousands of atoms (and match the isotopic composition) and do the same kind of thing.  Is it ""meaningless"" to say the two protein molecules have switched places because they are indistinguishable (composite) particles?

I am very much open to being persuaded, but most of the comments I got in the original thread were basically, ""electrons are indistinguishable, therefore that statement is meaningless.""  That doesn't really help.

Is it the fact that we really should always consider the wavefunction of the entire system, and the two electrons are inextricably intertwined in that way?  But if so, how do we define our ""system""?  What if I instead talk about an electron that is emitted from our Sun, and about the same time an electron is emitted from Alpha Centauri A, and they cruise through space and eventually fall into the other star.  Feel free to detect them along the way.  Have those two electrons not switched stars?  Is the entire universe always our ""system"", if we want to be precisely correct?

It would be great if someone who is an actual quantum/particle theorist could chime in.

dMy/dt = g * (Mz * Bx - Mx * Bz) - My/T2


dMz/dt = g * (Mx * By - My * Bx) - (Mo-Mz)/T1


Where T1 is the relaxation time for the z direction and T2 is the relaxation time for the transverse (x-y) plane. Mo is the initial magnetization which is only in the z-direction. This is usually transformed into the rotation frame to get it into terms of frequencies, as well as By and Bx in terms of frequencies, but for simplicity I'm going to leave it like this. I'm trying to think of this in terms of an energy balance, where


Input+Generation=Output+Accumulation+Consumption


I see how the accumulation term is the derivative terms, what about the rest? Are the cross product terms the ""In-Out"" terms? Are the relaxation terms generation (decay rate) terms? Do I have it backwards or am I totally wrong on both ideas? I'm not totally sure why I can't wrap my head around this..."

To feed my physics interest, I have been working as a research assistant to a professor I had in my first semester. We are about to submit a paper for publication (woohoo!) and she has just received a very large grant. She said she doesn't have a PhD student at the moment, and offered for me to skip my MS and go straight into getting one. Her grant will pay for it so I don't have to take out any more loans, but I am not sure how employable I would be with a PhD in Space Physics. 

It's an extremely enticing offer because the field is interesting to me and the degree is free, but I don't really want to work in academia due to the stressful way that life is portrayed, nor do I want to be held back from certain jobs due to overqualification.

When might a laser beam have it's wavelength changed? (via reflection or diffraction or other such phenomenon),11,6,False,False,False,Physics,1497554428,True,"I'm preparing for a project that will involve high powered lasers, and I'm considering getting a pair of broad-spectrum laser safety goggles with okay absorption, or a pair of goggles with excellent absorption but at a much more narrow spectrum.

What I'm wondering is, if the laser is of a very specific wavelength (1064 nm) and I only plan on using that one for the foreseeable future, do I need the more broad spectrum ones?  Is it possible that a laser would bounce off something or diffract through a translucent material in such a way that it's wavelength greatly changes?  I know white light can get broken down into it's constituents by passing through prism, but that's not actually changing the color of the light, just separating it's constituents.

Another concern is if the laser starts burning a spot until it glows, that light would be incandescent, and possibly result in colors other than the wavelength of the laser.  But... if I know my physics, that light won't be a coherent beam.  It won't have the same destructive effect as a laser beam would.

I am currently trying to calculate a w/w% and w/v% of a cream with melatonin, which will be applied topically in a clinical trial.

Currently we are undecided on the concentration of the cream, as well as the size of the area for which it should be applied. Does anyone know of a formula, I can use, to easily change variables?
E.g.: I want to apply a total dose of 25 mg melatonin to a 400 cm2 area of skin. Cream necessary for efficient application: 0.0027 mL/cm2 Total area: 400 cm2 Total dose: 25 mg
Density of the cream: 0.95g/ml (a bit of uncertainty, based on how much air is put into the cream, when the melatonin is dissolved into it)

What would the w/v% of the cream need to be, in order to achieve the above? Also, does anyone have any sort of formula, that I could possibly punch into an Excel-sheet? (This would be fantastic, as the area required for application might be changed, and I would then need a new w/v% for the manufacturer of the cream. 
The total dose applied needs to remain at 25 mg).

I already tried /r/pharmacology with no luck, so due to the calculations including SI-units, I figured that someone from /r/physics would see it as a trivial question :)

Isn't everything always being measured?,31,9,False,False,False,Physics,1497629255,True,"I'll start with clearly defining the subject of this question. This is a question about the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, related specifically to the Double Slit Experiment.

This post will be a bit long but please bear with me, as while I imagine most of us are familiar with the things I'm about to state, I just want to ensure we're operating with the same language and understanding.

Wikipedia defines the Copenhagen Interpretation as follows, : ""According to the Copenhagen interpretation, physical systems generally do not have definite properties prior to being measured, and quantum mechanics can only predict the probabilities that measurements will produce certain results. The act of measurement affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values immediately after the measurement. This feature is known as wave function collapse.""

I include this because it is essentially how I've always understood the Copenhagen Interpretation.

My understanding of the Double Slit Experiment in its simplest form is as follows (I'll talk about it with an electron rather than a photon, to avoid some issues with Newton later):

An electron gun shoots electrons at 2 slits in a barrier, and there is a detector screen set up on the other side. The electrons upon accumulating, exhibit an interference pattern on the screen, indicating that they behaved like waves, passing through both slits and interferring on the other side. However, each electron is going through individually. From what I understand of quantum mechanics, what is actually happening here is that each particle is represented by a wave function which contains multiple probabilities for the states of the electron, and this wave-function interferes with itself to produce the interference pattern. However, when we do the Double Slit experiment, but include a detector to detect which slit the electron passed through, we no longer get an interference pattern. The reason for this (according to the Copenhagen interpretation) is because the wavefunction collapses when the electron is measured. This is because in order to measure a condition of something, we must physically interact with/disturb/alter that thing. According to this understanding, it is not measuring per se (the extraction of useful physical data) that collapses the wavefunction, but the interaction that produces that data. 

Here's my problem with that. Isn't everything being ""measured"" all the time?

According to GR, the moving electron distorts spacetime in some way, seeing as it has some energy and momentum. Theoretically, that distortion would be ""measurable"" even if minute. It seems to me then, that the wavefunction should always be 'collapsed' if that makes any sense. I understand that the reconciliation of GR and QM is a big physical problem, but even if we scrap GR and just consider Newton's idea of gravity, I think we still have a problem.

According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation (here's why I used the electron) every particle (with mass) in the Universe attracts every other particle (with mass) in the universe. However negligible that force is due to the small mass of the particles, or the distance between them, the force exists. Therefore, our electron in the Double Slit experiment is being physically interacted with by literally every other mass in the Universe. The fact that we don't have an apparatus with the sensitivity to measure that interaction doesn't change that fact. So if physical interaction by a macroscale system collapses the wavefunction, how can the wavefunction ever not be collapsed? Isn't physical interaction (gravity) always happening? Why is there ever an ""un-collapsed"" wavefunction? Is the collapse of the wave-function a discrete event, or can it somehow be more or less collapsed depending on the magnitude of the physical disturbance?

TL;DR  Why doesn't gravity collapse a subatomic particles wavefunction?

"Gravity is a fundamental force, or spacetime curvature is what we call gravity?",12,4,False,False,False,Physics,1497678449,True,"Can't have your cake and eat it too! These views are mutually exclusive (probably, I don't want to speak with certainty about theories), one is probably correct and one is probably wrong. The most recent posts I could find on this subject are archived, so I thought an update from the physics community might be nice. I've read the older posts. The best I got of that is there are different ways to look at the problem mathematically (granted).

I just watched the documentary Hawking's made in 2008. They go though all the trouble of explaining gravity (very well actually), only to call it a force though the rest of the documentary; without explaining that leap in logic.

Personally think that gravity (as a force) is an illusion of spacetime; it's not a force, you might be able to call mass a force, but it's more an intrinsic property. And Einstein would probably agree with this. Right?

Need help with an experiment,8,3,False,False,False,Physics,1497703131,True,"Hi, I'm an 11th grader and I have to do an individual experiment this summer and I need some help. I've decided to base my experiment on fluid dynamics. At first I wanted to see the effect of bending the tubing in a hydraulic system and the force output, but there isn't a mathematical relationship between the two (I think). So instead I thought I could focus my experiment on the movement of fluids through pipes and pressure loss. I am going to use the Bernoulli Equation and measure the headloss. The things I need to measure in my setup are the fluid velocity (by calculating discharge), and the pressure at the beginning of the piping and the pressure at the end of the piping. This way I can plot my data and find the relationship. The issue is that I don't think that my setup is practical, I don't know how to efficiently measure the discharge, and I don't know how to measure the two pressures (what device do I need). So I know that the bending in the tubing does contribute to pressure loss and my goal is to see what the effect is.
Thanks!"

Why do we have three generations of leptons and quarks? Why do they have different masses?,21,1,False,False,False,Physics,1497716065,True,"So I've just graduated from my undergrad Physics degree (yay me!) and have been working through *Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur* because I never got a proper grounding on the subject and I finally have some time on my hands now.

I've got to the end, and found the book doesn't go beyond the Weinberg-Salam electroweak model, and the topic of quark and hadron physics was noticeably absent.

I don't really feel like wading deeply into the heavyweight texts if I can avoid it, so could anyone offer to me an explanation for the origin of different particle generations and what role they play in the SM?

Are they simply an observed phenomenon or a consequence of symmetry? What causes the wild differences in mass between the different types of quarks (and the different types of leptons)?

Also if anyone could present why the strong force preserves flavour but the weak force doesnt that would be interesting too.

[Question] Who builds the equipment and experiments in R&D labs? Can they be DIYd?,5,5,False,False,False,Physics,1497722129,True,"I'm a mechanical engineering graduate level from brazil who tries to emphasize at physics. Our labs are either the equipment equivalent to a kids science kit or a time portal that gets u to the 40's.

Anyways, here we have PAICS, freely translated it stands for Academic Scientific Initiation Project. It's basically scientific research done for free (but it's amazing for your curriculum, like unbelievably amazing. Not that i care too much about that right now, as all i want is to pursue rigorous scientific research). 

All that being said, my idea is to create a project about building new lab equipment, experiments as required, etc. So the college labs could be more well suited for students to learn by tackling real problems head on, creating incentives to even more PAICS(I believe some people don't do it as often because of the reasons stated above) and maybe , in my wildest dreams, if enough is done, have the structure ready for a physics engineering major(this is a 10 years from now goal, but you gotta start somewhere, right?) 

So I need your help to understand what can be built, what can't and if so, why it can't be. 

Note1: my college gets TONS (like 1% of the industrial complex annual revenue) of money, but it's mostly from the industry  so one can expect the college to be furiously industrial minded(and oh boy, it's hateful)

Need a bit of help in choosing my degree.,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1497732155,True,"Hello everyone! I have been stressing over this for quite some time and would really appreciate any input from you people. I finished my school this year with good grades and now I have to choose a college for further studies.  

I enjoy Physics. I really mean it, I enjoy studying and doing problems. I would love to get into academia and research and maybe even teach. The thing is, in my country(India) there is very little respect and opportunity for proper science and research. Engineering is virtually the only area where proper opportunities are available. So my plan was to get my bachelor's here and then move out for master's and PhD.  
Now I currently have two choices for my Physics degree.  
1. BSc. Honours in Physics, 3 years (Delhi University)  [pdf syllabus](http://www.du.ac.in/du/uploads/old-ug-courses/04082010_physics.pdf)  
2. BTech in Engineering Physics, 4 years (National Institute of Technology) [pdf syllbaus](http://www.nitc.ac.in/app/webroot/img/upload/BTech_Engg_Phys.pdf)  
Obviously the first one is more theoretical and I like it too but I have read that other countries require a 4 year bachelor's degree and this is what's confusing me. Because the 4 year degree is actually an engineering degree and is much more focused on the practical aspects. Which one should I go for?     


PS: Sometimes it feels as if I am not smart enough to get into academia and I won't be able to write papers or think of something original and would never be able to get a PhD. Did you ever feel this? So are there any prospects for making a decent livelihood off a Physics degree, because in my country there are virtually none."

I have a question and was hoping someone would clear things up for me. tell me if i make a mistake along the way:
1-as far as i know the metric tensor is invariant meaning the curvature of space looks the same for all frames.
2-that means that ""relativistic mass"" doesn't determine the curvature but the rest mass does.
3-the rest mass is the total internal energy in the object divided by c squared right? my mass is basically the energy of the particles in my body.
4-so i concluded that even if i speed up and move at high speed i wont curve space any further than i did when i was at rest. otherwise if i get real close to light speed i would eventually i would turn into a black hole.
5-photons do not have rest mass, but you can put a photon in a mirror box (0 mass) and the mass of the box would be h*f/c^2.

Can you use a multimeter to detect if the wire is grounded? Let's say you have some capacitors and resistors too if you need those for your method...
____

The actual application issue...

I have a wire I run from my basement to help ground some guitar effects and things. 

I often wonder if the connection downstairs is good...The wire goes to some iron plumbing. And then maybe the iron pipe terminates before it hits soil... (It's an old remnant pipe from a radiator system)... 

So maybe it's not truly grounded. Maybe the connection is interrupted somewhere in that path. How can I tell?

So is there a test with a multimeter I can do with just the free end of my ground wire? Or do I have to drop my other lead from my multimeter to a known ground and check for zero volts?

Bonus part B if anyone knows... The ground wire does have a positive effect. On one guitar pedal...if there is a buzz, I can take the ""ground"" wire and touch it to the exposed ground on the pedal and the buzz stops... *but I only briefly touch it and that clears it up for a while.* My going theory is that there is some built up extra charge on the pedal and the temporary touch with the ground takes away excess charge and gets it neutral. 

So I figure maybe that proves my suspected ground wire is truly grounded. But then one more alternative popped up. The wire is really long... like 40ft. Can a free 40ft wire neutralize a small excess charge just by capacitance? Placing one end in contact with excess charge would let the charge flow out to be equally distributed along the wire. So maybe a long free wire can act like a ground? For small charges etc..."

Matter, waves, etc. from the macro scale down to the quantum scale, appears to move through the 3 dimensions in a way that they *could* recur at the same exact 3 coordinates again. The reason any body moves through the dimensions is because energy (is this an accurate word?) allows them to. If you push a ball forward, then go and push it back, the direction of that energy allows the ball to move back to where it began. What this brings me to is, if energy moves objects through space, what is moving objects through time?

The trouble I have is this: If you choose your inertial frame to measure things off of, the traveling twin is just that - traveling. But if you choose your inertial frame to be that of the traveling twin, the movement and dynamics of the earthbound twin look identical to those of your own.

For this to make sense to me, I want to say that there is a preferred frame, an absolute frame (ie ether) but I know that that isn't the case. Why is it that we can't just say that the earth has accelerated away from the ""traveler""? "

Quantum entanglement and simultaneity,34,11,False,False,False,Physics,1498073372,True,"I've had this question about the mechanics of quantum entanglement. As I understand it, if you have two entangled particles, and you measure the state of one so that it collapses from superposition into a particular state, then the state of the other particle will be measured as the opposite state if it were to be measured at the same time.

But its the phrase ""same time"" that I'm finding difficulty with here. So let me create a scenario.

Let's say we have a pair of entangled particles, one I'll keep here in my lab and the other one will go onto a spaceship that will travel away from the Earth at about 87% the speed of light. Let's say our clocks are synced as the ship leaves at 12 noon on Monday. Due to time dilation, at 12 noon Tuesday on Earth, I will measure that the time on the ship is actually midnight on Tuesday morning. But, due to the relativity of simultaneity, at midnight on the ship, they'll measure the time on Earth as being 6pm Monday evening. And at 6pm Monday for me, I measure the time on the ship as 3pm Monday, etc and so forth.

So if I measure the state of the particle at 12pm Tuesday, then when on the ship is the opposite measurement guaranteed to occur? Midnight on Tuesday morning? 12 noon on Wednesday?

The fact that relativity tells us there is no absolute sense of ""now"" or ""same time"" makes me wonder how this entanglement of states between particles is maintained across distances and reference frames...

Is it 
 
* due to the fact that the Z-Boson couplling is differently for left and righthanded particles and consists of a mixture of axial and vectorial coupling

* because the amount of CC events is lower in the Antineutrino film since the W Boson requires an Antiquark for it's interaction

Laser intensity incident on a surface,4,5,False,False,False,Physics,1498113175,True,"Hello all,

Firstly I'm not sure if this is the right sub to be asking this, please suggest another more appropriate one if there is. 

I'm working on creating a mathematical model of a laser range finder system. I'm calculating the Gaussian beam profile for the beam at the given distance using the Gaussian beam equation. I can then find the square of the absolute of this value to find the intensity profile. 

I'm getting a little confused when it comes to calculating how much energy is incident on the ""target"" plates. As I'm dealing with very large distances (up to around 20km) the beam waist can be a few m by this point, so I'm guessing some form of integral using the targets coordinates as the limits should give me the total energy/intensity on that target? I.e. The volume under the Gaussian intensity plot. However when I've tried this for the plots (using MATLAB's 'integral2' function), I get a value about 10^4 times smaller than the peak intensity value, which obviously can't be right. 

Has anyone dealt with a similar problem before or know what I should be doing? 

This is leading into a situation where the total beam area is larger than the target, and the target isn't perfectly cantered on the propagation axis, so I want to know the total energy/intensity in the area where the two interest.

My apologies if some of this is unclear, posting at the end of a very confusing day! More than happy to clarify anything. 

Thanks for any help in advance.

But with opposing magnets, both sides have either S pole, or both N pole. Using the left hand rule it seems to me both sides generates a force in the same direction. Result would be no rotation. But I know this motor works, because we tried it. Whereas the N-S pole magnet combination doesn't work.

I drew a diagram to illustrate my confusion. http://imgur.com/a/RMdcL

Help would be greatly appreciated."

Hypotheses about the big bang,10,0,False,False,False,Physics,1498234000,True,"I really like to think about the universe, maths,  science and filosofy. So couple years ago i was thinking about the universe with a friend who i like to discuss my ideas with, and i came to a quite interesting hypotheses (not sure if i'm using the word right but i don't want to use ""theory"" because it might cause confusion, this Idea is unproven as far as i know) about the big bang and i thought it was worth sharing so here ya go:

Time is infinite, just like All spacial dimensions. There is a cycle of a big bang happening over and over again. Basically, you have a big bang, in which All matter Comes to existance. After a while, Gravity pulls All matter together, turning it back into energy, wherafter another big bang follows and so it Goes on forever.

There are a couplet things that im not sure about namely:

-i once saw a documentary about the big bang in which it was said that in the beginning, there was only pure energy, acumilated in one single point, somehow it started to turn to matter and that was the big bang. I don't know if this is true.

-Black holes are black holes because they dont emit light, i once heard that this was because the Gravity from a black hole is so immense that even light cannot escape it. I strongly doubt this as light has No mass so i don't see how gravity could influence it.  The reason this is a condition for my hypotheses is because if you emit light into the endless universe, it wont come back, unless it is pulled back by something, in this case im hoping for it to be a black hole that comes to existance when All mass is together in one Giant ball.

The more i think about this the more problems i fond with it but its pretty cool anyways so i decided to share. I think it also sheds light on what i think to be a flaw in the big bang theory, or at least some people's interpretation of it namely that it Just happened. Everything in the universe happens for a reason as far as i know, it is caused by something. If the universe is in an infinite cycle then that would be a basis to discovering a direct cause of the big bang.


Lastly, thanks for reading this entire thing, please note that i am not a physicist and if you are, im sorry for probably having to have Read through An awful number of falsities. Please also note that a lot of it does not precisely represent my thoughts on the matter as it's hard to put my ideas into words especially on these kinds of subjects."

Since it is broadly accepted that time as we understand it is the fourth dimension, I had this idea. Though selecting a point in space (such as a dust mote on top of a desk) is difficult due to the infinitesimally small size of a point, let's select a point 1mm in diameter, 1mm above the desk. Is there any basis in the theory that due to dimensional 'perspective' of time, while the size of the point may not change, its state or 'history' doesn't? If we had such a means like a theoretical telescope, that we use to see far away things in our 3D world, could we see far away (in time) versions of that point?

Questions about Ball physics,8,4,False,False,False,Physics,1498284121,True,"Hi redditors, 

If you throw a ball vertically upwards, for the same distance, does it take longer for a ball to reach maximum height than to travel downwards to displacement = 0, assuming that there is no air resistance?

My logic is that the resultant force to throw the ball upwards is (F - Weight)
And when the ball is falling the resultant force is weight only

Is current a vector quantity?,13,1,False,False,False,Physics,1498393738,True,"IK how the usual explanation goes, how the angle between the wires does not affect force, but I think it is still vector. Here is how:
Current is moving from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. That's it's direction. You cannot change that direction. Even in a parallel setup, the current moves like force and gets added up, like this-:
Force: 5N--->
Is the same as 
3N--->
2N--->
Since the angle is zero, i.e. the direction is same, the net force is 5N
Similarly for current:
5A---> (from +ve to -ve)
Is the same as
3A--->
2A---> in a parallel wire. They get added at the other junction and become 5A.

So can we say current is a vector quantity, but we cannot change it's direction, hence net current between I(1) and I(2) is :
I(net)=✓I(1)+I(2)+2I(1)I(2)cos0°
          =I(1)+I(2) always?
Or is there some other explanation to current being scalar?

and the same for x''2 to calculate the new position by going all the way from new acceleration to new velocity to new position.

So i have added a third pendulum by just adding a third equation and adding a connection from the second (middle) pendulum to third just like x''2 = -g/l2 + k/m2 (x2 - x1) - k/m2 (x3 - x2)

What happens when you're inside a 4D torus?,28,45,False,False,False,Physics,1498564316,True,"So let's imagine we're in a super small universe, the size of a city, the space of which is curved into a donut (Torus). That is, the edges of our 3D space were glued together forming a cylinder and then the two ends were glued together.  

If you picture this in 2 dimensions you have a flat piece of paper, a single line drawn across it ( representing land) a stick figure walking back and forth along that strip, and we take the piece of paper, attach to ends making a hollow cylinder and then attach the cylinder making it a donut shape

So now that in our 3 dimensions. I want to know what we would see. If we traveled in a straight line we would end up in the same place as we started, just like the 2D man. If we were standing next to a mountain, the light hitting the back of the mountain would travel around and hit our eye, and we'd see the mountain on the horizon. My question is how would this look to us? Would we see one mountain in the center of the horizon no matter where we looked, would we see a stretched out mountain going across the whole horizon, would we see duplicates, and if so, would they be right next to each other, would there be gaps, etc?

How are Partial Differential Equations derived experimentally?,4,15,False,False,False,Physics,1498583791,True,"I feel that I should preface this by saying that I am a novice physics student, I have only taken one college physics class and I have taken one class on differential equations (along with the standard calculus curriculum). As the header states, I was wondering how Equations that involve partial differential equations are derived. More specifically I am wondering what specific experimental results would lead a researcher to believe that a certain experiment will result in a differential equation and how to derive a partial differential equation from data. Furthermore, since most partial differential equations that I have seen can be solved to a ""regular"" equation, given proper boundary conditions, why would it not be possible to derive the regular equation from the experimental results?"
Question regarding air pressure,11,1,False,False,False,Physics,1498587571,True,"Ok so this will sound weird but it is research for a sci-fi novel i'm planning on making
http://imgur.com/a/rrSaQ
This is a bad illustration but i hope it will help explain my question 

So i want to make an underwater building, but i don't want the water to fill the whole building
As you can see in the illustration
I made stairs that go down under the sea floor and then go back up into the outer room of the building

The idea is that if the room has air, and it has a system that produces pressure, we could have a higher pressure in the room than the water pressure, so the water will not go in

Apparently for every 10 meters down the pressure goes 1 atm up
So at 100m pressure it should be 10 atm
So the room should have a pressure of about 11 atm

Do you think this would work ?

Also, i didn't add this in the illustration, but a door between the stairs and a pressure system that activates when you want to open the door would be a lot more efficient right?

I hope this explains it, if not please ask me to clarify

MS in Physics - Unable to land for over a year,36,53,False,False,False,Physics,1498605054,True,"I obtained a Master's in Physics a year ago and have been applying for jobs for *over a year* and I've sent out nearly *3000+* applications to startups, small companies, mid-sized companies, corporations, etc.

I used C++ for my thesis project. I've also used R and Python for data analysis and machine learning personal projects. I've gotten interviews for Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, C++ Developer, etc jobs. I've had some technical phone screens for Data Engineer and Data Scientist roles, but I keep bombing them and rarely get invited on-site. I've had coding HW assignments, and even though I'm sure I got some of them right, I *still* was rejected. 

I feel like I'm in no-man's land. I get more callbacks for experienced than entry-level roles, and often from startups. But then I often get asked advanced technical questions I have no experience with, and thus I fail the interview. It seems slightly easier to land a on-site interview for the C++ Developer roles, but I still can't get an offer. I've only gotten about 2 on-site interviews per month

I've applied all over the US, but am now focusing on companies close to where I live and the Bay Area, as I pretty much only get on-site interviews for them. I already have a Github, my own website, etc. This job search has me thinking I'm better off just switching to a different career, such as teaching

For those with a Master's in Physics, how difficult was your job search? What kinds of jobs do you think are more likely to hire those with Master's in Physics? Should I just aim for C++ developer jobs, work on more personal projects using C++?

"Imposter syndrome, anxiety and fear of failure.",11,18,False,False,False,Physics,1498657522,True,"First of all i'm not sure if such a post is welcome here, but i'd welcome suggestions as to where else to post it where i could get experienced opinions.

So setting the context for everyone, last year i finished my physics undergrad after what felt like the hardest and worst semester of my life, I actually intended to take a gap year since i didn't know what to do next and didn't feel like having the energy to put up with anything. But i already had sent some requests for admission in various Masters programs and got accepted in what for me looked like a really good opportunity(particle physics and gravitation), so i said to myself 'get your shit together it's only one more year, then you can take a time off' so i moved to this new city and started this Masters. It didn't take long for me to realise that i was lacking a bit in required knowledge so i was struggling very hard to finish the assignments, which could be seen with my initial grades. I thought a lot about quitting but my parents gave me the strength to go on. Fast forward to today, i passed all the courses with an approximate average of 8-8.5/10 (Spanish grading system, actually don't know exactly how it converts to the more common A-F or GPA grades), but i feel like these grades were cheated, since i was heavily dependant on a study group that formed in class, where i would bombard them with questions and needed explanations for everything, without this group i'm not sure i would have passed, but if i had it would have been with a lot worse average. Which after reading a bit suggests that this'd be Imposter syndrome and that in actuality i should be proud of myself. But i just can't see it that way.

Now, i may have passed the courses but i have still my Masters thesis pending, which due to my struggling with the rest of the courses, i neglected. Now i have about a month and a half left to do it in its entirety (the main idea of this project is to recreate the calculations of a paper that my advisor wrote a couple months back and then apply all this to a different case, but seeing the time constraint he already told me that in the worst case i could just present a review of his work and be done with it). But especially due to the time constraints i'm having issues working, alas, i again feel lost, not understanding enough of what goes on. So i'd say anxiety has kicked in, i started procrastinating, and fearing the fact that the moment i try to work on it i'll fail since i don't understand it, which only puts me more off.

Now for my advisor this seems like really easy work and takes many steps for granted so i actually feel bad asking stupid obvious questions, and feel like i'm letting him down not knowing how to do X and Y. The same goes for my parents who have put so much effort to allow me all this educational path i took and i feel like obligated to finish everything asap and with the best grades possible. But on the inside i just don't want to right now i'm tired.

So what do you think? Should i be prolonging my Masters another year to work peacefully on my thesis, even though this is also an expense problem. Would such a prolongation have any negative effects later on when applying for jobs or looking into PhD positions? I actually finished everything in the expected time frames until now, so i'd be getting a Masters in Physics at the age of 22 almost 23, one year extra makes it 23 almost 24 which i think sounds great, i'm just confused right now so i don't know. Maybe it's also just my lack of motivation which makes me seek out comforting words of stranger telling me to give myself some time and not to rush everything.

Hopefully i can get some advice from people who overcame such situations."

BSc vs Mphys,16,6,False,False,False,Physics,1498660080,True,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this. 

I am currently on an Mphys program at Manchester (UK) and have just finished my third year and got my results today.

I am seriously considering doing this because I don't enjoy it anymore and don't deal with exam stress well at all. I have no desire to do a PhD or stay in academia at all. So my question is would it be deterimental to my future job prospects to bail out now and take my BSc and 1st? Or should I stick with it and get my masters.

Which proliferating scientific fields have significant overlap with physics and foreseeable high probability of application to better the life of common men?,32,6,False,False,False,Physics,1498734185,True,"I ask because in high school I always thought that there were many things left to do in Physics that were being actively worked on and even people from fields slightly different than physics could pitch in on, like certain branches of engineering, that would greatly help the average Joe.

But the older I've grown it seems there is always some problem. For example, commercial nuclear fusion. It seems interdisciplinary and would benefit people but efforts and funding seem lackluster, based on some hearsay, despite the prospects and relative likelihood of success. 

Then some fields seem like they are restricted to physicists even though an engineer with relevant knowledge could probably bolster the efforts. For example, from what I have heard of quantum computing/information theory, it is mostly worked on by physicists even though some electrical engineers also study a majority of the relevant theory quite well. That and hearsay also says it is quite niche.

Please pardon me if I have the wrong ideas because as I have said, all this information is based on the limited things I have heard.

Are there any fields which fit what I have described in the title, even the examples above (in case I have the wrong idea)?"

Physics GRE...?,2,4,False,False,False,Physics,1498790837,True,"Is there a GRE physics prep book you found helpful? I took the GRE several years ago and had the official GRE test questions as practice and I found it quite helpful (still didn't do as well as I wanted).

I studied even more for the most recent GRE using the same book, but I felt as though the practice exams in my book were COMPLETELY different than the one I was taking (in terms of topics covered and what % of questions were certain topics), that I did so terribly. It felt so different than the GRE I took several years ago and the practice exams my prep book had.

Air Cooling,0,4,False,False,False,Physics,1498798151,True,"Okay so this one was bugging me a little bit. There are plenty of things in everyday life that are either passively or actively air cooled. Like computers... car radiators... me in front of a fan... this all makes sense because the air is either drawing away heat directly or causing evaporative cooling either externally or in a closed system (i.e. the radiator). 


But then there's jet planes. They have to accommodate for heat caused by the moving air, as I understand the friction of the plane moving through the air. 

So then, where is the cross over? At what point does air stop cooling and start causing frictional heating? How to aerospace engineers account for differences in properties of the air say, from a passenger jet a few thousand feet up to an SR 71 85,000 feet up that expands several inches at full speed compared to standing size on the ground. And then throw in with that the fact that the temperatures up there are as cold as -65F. Wouldn't that counteract a large part of the frictional heat? Obviously not a whole lot because asteroids burn up when they fall from space, and the space shuttle needs heat shielding. "

Gaussian surface with charge offset from centre,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1498816679,True,"This is just a problem I made up for myself and I almost got it to come out but not quite.  According to Gauss's Law I should get [; \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} ;]  

but it doesn't quite come out.  Here is a link to my [work so far](https://gist.github.com/kiwiheretic/99e526eb54c9d62f6cfb942899c73586).  This doesn't display that well and reddit doesn't like my heavy latex so will try to put the main results here.  I have a charge q offset a distance a_x along the x axis inside a sphere of radius r (so r > a).  The surface is parametrized according to (alpha, beta) where alpha is an angle in the x-y plane and beta is angle between x-y and z plane.  

The electric field is defined as:  

`[; E_x = \frac{q }{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \left(a_{x}^{2} - 2 a_{x} r \cos{\left (\alpha \right )} \cos{\left (\beta \right )} + r^{2}\right)} ;]`

`[; E_y = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \left(a_{x}^{2} - 2 a_{x} r \cos{\left (\alpha \right )} \cos{\left (\beta \right )} + r^{2}\right)} ;]`

`[; E_z = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \left(a_{x}^{2} - 2 a_{x} r \cos{\left (\alpha \right )} \cos{\left (\beta \right )} + r^{2}\right)} ;]`

and the unit normal is defined as:  

`[; \tilde{N} =  (\cos{\left (\alpha \right )} \cos{\left (\beta \right )})\mathbf{\hat{i}_{N}} + (\sin{\left (\alpha \right )} \cos{\left (\beta \right )})\mathbf{\hat{j}_{N}} + (\sin{\left (\beta \right )})\mathbf{\hat{k}_{N}};]`
I basically evaluated this as a double integral over alpha and beta.

`[; \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \tilde{E} \cdot \tilde{N} \alpha d \beta ;]`

E_y and E_z vanished in doing the first integral but the first integral of E_x evaluated to `[; - \frac{ q}{4 a_{x} \epsilon_{0} r} ;]` which doesn't look like I'm heading in the right direction.

Isn't it true that Gauss's Law doesn't/shouldn't care about how the surface around and enclosing the charge is drawn?  So it shouldn't matter that the charge is not at the origin, right?"

This is to allow successful scattering.

I'm not entirely sure how this works. My understanding is that when the de Broglie wavelength is larger than the nucleus the wave packet is more spread out in space and thus chances of striking and getting scattered by the nucleus is greatly reduced although non-zero.

This should happen because with a larger wavepacket the probability of finding the electron right where the nucleus is located when the wavepacket passes through or engulfs the nucleus decreases with increase in the wave packet size and since probability current density is conserved, the chances of hitting the nucleus diminishes.

With a smaller comparable sized wavepacket we can say almost with 100% guarantee that the electron must be somewhere in the wave packet which totally fits the nucleus this time and hence the scattering occurs.

I'm seeking clarification, as I'm not sure if this is the case."

"[Question] ""blur"" radius of a beam of light passing through a lens?",0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1498971226,True,"I want to answer a fundamental question about photography and photogrammetry. How does ""depth of field"" work?

I am not _new_ to this topic in the sense that I am unfamiliar with it, so I am looking for a well-defined and detailed answer of describing the affects of ""depth of field.""

From what I understand light from an object passing through a lens from a certain distance that renders the object ""unfocused"" and that is dependent on how far away the object is.

Now, I have seen some basic algorithms that are used for ""reversing blur radius"" in an image, but the issue I see is that it _universally_ reverses that blur radius.

An example:

For a digital image, you may dictate that the image is blurred using a 8-pixel radius, meaning that every pixel has an influence of every pixel around it in a 8-pixel radius.

But the issue is that how do you know which blur radius to use for reversing when different points in space are at different distances away from the lens?

Say that the only factor affecting blur is distance from the lens and say the lens has a given focal length and the sensor for the camera is set a specific distance away. Ignore all blurs due to noise, motion, lens dirt, etc.

__Can we determine what blur radius to be reversed for each individual pixel/point? and if so, how do I do it?__

**NOTE::** I want to answer this question given 2 contexts:

1. We know the distance from the lens to every point on every object within the camera's field of view

2. We don't know that distance."

But as I was working on this and faced some problems I asked my physics teacher for help, sadly it did't help me too much.

Is it possible to solve classical problems indirectly via quantum mechanics?,7,4,False,False,False,Physics,1499185690,True,"Hi, /r/physics! I've been searching variations of my question on Google without much luck and I don't really have anyone I can ask IRL, so I was hoping someone could help me and maybe point me in the direction of some reading!

I've been reading about the 'solve-and-quantise' method of obtaining a quantum mechanical theory from a classical theory by replacing amplitudes with creation and annihilation operators. I was wondering whether the reverse operation is viable, that is, can one simplify the analysis of some problems in classical mechanics by (1) writing down a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian and (2) solving the corresponding Schrodinger equation for the allowed states satisfying some initial conditions (both steps perhaps simplified via application of  machinery available in quantum mechanics but not available in classical mechanics, e.g. creation and annihilation operators) and subsequently evaluating the classical limit of <x(t)> and <p(t)>? 

For example, I wonder whether such an approach is used to obtain some classical bath Hamiltonians used in molecular dynamics simulations? Are there any interesting applications where such an approach is routinely used?

Molar Absorptivity - Spectroscopy,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1499185995,False,
The downward velocity of a building falling by sequentially collapsing floors,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1499186762,True,"I have noticed that a key element in the conspiracy theories around the 9/11 events is about the falling velocity of the collapsing buildings. I have no opinion on the conspiracy theories myself, but think it would be interesting to check what some very basic physics using energy conservation principles can tell us about the issue. The following analysis is pretty basic and easy to follow:

The building is modelled as a vertical stack of point masses with mass m, where m is the mass of a single floor, separated by a length d representing the distance between floors. 


**Case1: The collapse starting with upper floor.**
The top floor falls down on the floor below. As a conservative measure, at least from the conspiracy viewpoint, the energy lost in breaking the supporting structures for the next floor is negligible, meaning that all the reduction in potential energy is translated into kinetic energy. Collision is presumed inelastic. 

When the upper floor falls into the floor below it has an kinetic energy of mgd, and the total mass falling M=mgd. When the next floor below is hit, the total energy is 2mgd + mgd, where the first term is the potential energy drop of the uppermost floor and the second term for the floor below. The falling mass is M=2mgd. More generally, when the first floor has fallen n floors, the energy and total falling mass is:

E_n = mgd(1 + 2 + ..... + n) ≈ mgd n*n/2

(I use explicit multiplication symbol partly only for clarity) The latter simplified term valid for n>>1. The total falling mass is:

M = nm

Energy conservation requires that the drop in potential energy equals the kinetic energy of the accumulated falling mass:
 
mgd n*n /2 = M v v /2

Introducing the total distance downward, s=nd, we get the nice result:

**v=sqrt(gs)**

This is a rather general result and tells us that the observed acceleration will be the half of the free fall acceleration, i.e. a=0,5g

**Case2: Collapse start somewhere below the top**
Say that the collapse start below the N'th floor counting from the top. By a similar reasoning as above we get:

E_n = mgd n( N + (n-1)/2 )
M = m(N + n + 1)

Using the limit N>>1 and n>>1 we get a rather nice result here to:

**v = sqrt(gs (1 + N/(N+n))** (or http://imgur.com/kk9DPLF)

This tells us that in the beginning of the collapse, N>>n, the building will fall down with free fall acceleration and that when n>>N it will approach the half of the free fall acceleration. The crossover takes place around n=N.

Of course the real collapsing dynamics includes many more details than the simple picture here. On the other side, energy considerations are pretty robust and can often give very good results even when details are not known. So if anyone would like to check this against the real case, please go on. Confirm or debunk!"

"How does the lunar cycle affect, if at all, time dilation and contraction on Earth?",6,2,False,False,False,Physics,1499213066,True,"So I tried [asking this here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/6l1c6y/does_time_dilate_and_contract_on_earth_with_the/), however I was too vague and so instead only really got feedback for how to ask the question better. So without further ado...

**Problem setup:**
---

When we're talking about time dilation and contraction, we need a reference point that is not the Earth, and that makes our answer meaningful. I'm going to choose the center of mass of the solar system as our reference point. (Because it gives no particular bias toward any particular other object in our solar system, and yet gives total bias toward objects in our solar system relative to the rest of the universe.) So now the question really is:

**How does the lunar cycle affect, if at all, time dilation and contraction on Earth relative to the center of mass of the solar system?**

But, for all intents and purposes, the center of mass of the solar system is really just the Sun, since that's where almost all of its mass resides. So let's simplify the wording just a bit for convenience to arrive at the question we will actually answer:

**How does the lunar cycle affect, if at all, time dilation and contraction on Earth relative to the Sun?**

Now, if you'll follow me for a little diversion that I feel will give this question a bit more perspective. Let's first ask an easier question:

**How does the** ***solar*** **cycle affect, if at all, time dilation and contraction on Earth relative to the Sun?**

Well, let's see.

At the perihelion of Earth's orbit (which occurs just after the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, several days after the new year), the Earth is traveling at its fastest relative to the Sun, and is also at its closest to the Sun.

At the aphelion of Earth's orbit (which occurs just after the northern hemisphere's summer solstice around the United States' Independence Day^(**1**)), the Earth is traveling at its slowest relative to the Sun, and is also at its farthest from the Sun.

Special relativity says that Earth's clock's should slow down relative to the Sun at the perihelion, and speed up at the aphelion.

Additionally, as anyone who as seen the movie Interstellar will never forget, clocks also tick slower the closer they are to a massive object. This effect also dictates that the Earth's clocks should slow down relative to the Sun at the perihelion, and speed up at the aphelion.

Since both special relativity and the Interstellar effect are acting in the same direction here, it is clear that Earth's clocks must indeed tick slowest at the perihelion, and fastest at the aphelion. (Relative to the Sun.)

Diversion completed. Now let's try to tackle the lunar cycle.

At the full moon, the Earth is traveling slower in its orbit around the Sun than at the new moon. (To see why, just consider how much faster the Moon is traveling at this time, and remember that the total momentum of the Earth and Moon is constant relative to the lunar cycle.) Simultaneously, the Earth is closer to the Sun than at the new moon. (Similarly, to see why, just consider how much farther the Moon is at this time.)

In this case, special relativity and the Interstellar effect no longer synergise, but oppose, so qualitative analysis cannot help us here, and we will have to get quantitative.

So, /r/physics, do these two effects cancel each other out exactly, or is there also an oscillation of Earth's clock speeds due to the lunar cycle as well?

---

**Footnote:**

In my country, fireworks go off twice a year, right around both the parahelion and the aphelion. What interestingly synchronous man-made weather!

Let's consider the following situation:
People have a ""power"" that allows them to expand or condense air/gas particles.
At first i thought it would be cool as in its like controlling the air to some degree, but now I'm thinking of another consideration

If i condense air im essentially decressing volume, and under atmospheric pressure that means P is not changing, so the tempreture has to change 
So,
Am i right in thinking that their power will have to entail almost freezing (when condensing) and heating (when expanding) the air?
And the more importand question: if they did this underwater (so with gasses dissolved in water) do you think ice would form, or water would boil ?

Edit: actully nvm the bit about pressure remaining the same, it probably? will change since its not a closed system, right ?

But still what do you think will happen? Would the tempreture change at all ?"

"[**creating** an exercise sheet problem] ""nonrelativistic"" Compton Scattering (target audience: students of biochemistry) – does this have some merit?",1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1499292487,True,"My PI tasked me with creating this semester's exercise sheets. In the current sheet students shall work with Compton Scattering. One of the subproblems that shall be solved (as per suggestion by my PI) is deriving Compton Scattering assuming nonrelativistic (i.e. Galilean) mechanics and a ""head on"" collision, i.e. the photon gets bounced into exactly the opposite direction.

I'm currently working on the sample solution and now begin wondering, if the whole thing makes even sense at all. I arrive at a solution for a wavelength shift, but this is very different from the relativistic Compton Scattering result.

Let's begin, of course, with conservation of energy and momentum. However this being calculated nonrelativistic neglecting the rest mass energy of the electron.

For the energy

`[; (E_\gamma = h\nu) + (E_e = 0) = (E_\gamma' = h\nu') + (E_e' = \frac{1}{2} m_e \mathrm{v}^2) ;]`

`[; h(\nu - \nu') = \frac{1}{2} m_e \mathrm{v}^2 ;]`

For the momentum

`[; (p_\gamma = \frac{h\nu}{c}) + (p_e = 0) = (p_\gamma' = \frac{h\nu'}{c}) + (p_e' = m_e \mathrm{v}) ;]`

solving for v

`[; \mathrm{v} = \frac{h}{m_e c}(\nu - \nu') ;]`

and inserting into energy (this is BTW, where the calculations differ the most – in the proper calculation one would use the relativistic energy momentum relation here)

`[; h(\nu - \nu') = \frac{1}{2} m_e \frac{h^2}{m_e^2 c^2}(\nu - \nu')^2 ;]`

`[; 1 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{m_e c^2}(\nu - \nu') ;]`

substituting frequency for wavelength

`[; 1 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{m_e c^2} (\frac{c}{\lambda} - \frac{c}{\lambda'}) ;]`

`[; 1 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{m_e c} (\frac{1}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{\lambda'}) ;]`

bringing the lambdas to the other side

`[; \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{\lambda'}} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{h}{m_e c} ;]`

And this is of course a very different expression, as one arrives at when using proper relativistic mechanics, which is

`[; \lambda - \lambda' = \frac{h}{m_e c}(1 - \cos(\varphi)) ;]`

considering the ""head on"" condition phi = pi, this cos(pi) = -1

`[; \lambda - \lambda' = \frac{h}{m_e c}(1 - \cos(\pi)) = 2 \frac{h}{m_e c} ;]`

-----

So the question is, does this nonrelativistic Compton Scattering have merit in any way, or is this so far off, that we should not confront our students with?

why a molecule let's say with 2 neutrons has a distance between these two nuclei that is bigger when the electrons are excited (in higher electronic energy levels that is).
I understand that the franck condon principle basically tells us that since the electrons are moving faster than the nuclei, the allowed energy levels are only those which are done perpendicularly in the potential graph. But why is the higher state shifted? What happen with the wave function?

Also in the case of a molecule with two atoms, how are the attracting forces (ionic, covalent, van der waals) are compensated by the force of Coulomb? Do I just sum up everything and get the real potential?

Just some blind conjecture on biology and quantum physics.,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1499458419,True,"If a physicist could answer this it would be great :)

OK so I know its the absolute worst thing in the world when someone who isn't a physicist comes up with some weird idea about quantum physics. I, too, roll my eyes whenever Deepak Chopra talk about anything. 

I'd like to just ask some things out of curiosity though, just stemming from a thought I had while listening to a debate on free will.

The premise I am trying to ask about is basically that the brain has evolved a mechanism by which we can take advantage of quantum effects exert influence on a quantum level in order to have some semblance of 'self control' or free will.

I'm no physicist so this is based on an extremely rudimentary understanding of various quantum phenomena as described by physicists in documentaries, on PBS Space Time and other web series etc. 

I'm interested in this because of links I have made in my mind between the following ideas:

1: The actual operation of the brain is still somewhat a mystery. We are getting to know more about it but we still don't actually understand it.

2: Plants have evolved so that photosynthesis takes advantage of quantum effects, which is why it is so unreasonably efficient for converting energy into a usable form.

3: Some stuff about chaos theory which shows how some tiny effect can have massive implications (my question regarding this would be whether that is even applicable when discussing quantum effects on macro phenomena).

4: I'm shooting in the dark on this one beause its a little bit aove my level of understanding. Our brains are electromagnetic beasts, no? Does this mean that their operation is fundamentally based in the electromagnetic quantum field, and could this suggest some kind of interplay between the biology and the quantum phenomena?

5: Just a question because again this isn't something I know anything about, but are quantum effects deterministic in nature? I know there are some really weird things going on which could call that into question at least. 

So basically I have made a bunch of assumptions here namely that there is interplay between biology and quantum phenomena, that the quantum world is responsible for everything, that our brains are able to take advantage of this, and the more metaphysical point that our 'consciousness' or the sum total of our brains' outputs are able to somehow 'guide' quantum interactions, which allows us to exert influence over our own thoughts and the operation of our brains, which would therefore endow us with free will.

I know this is a massive stretch, and if anything I'm just looking for a physicist to tell me why this is wrong, because although it feels clearly wrong its an interesting idea.

Thanks"

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and Chaos Theory. The wave function.,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1499466914,True,"So I've always been absolutely fascinated by quantum mechanics and the various interpretations of it.  One of my biggest fascinations has been about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

I recently watched this documentary about chaos theory and it was incredibly interesting:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJAs9Qr359o

From my understanding, chaos theory happens when you don't know the initial conditions precisely enough.  

Since the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle specifically states (in a simplified way) that you cannot know the position and the momentum of an electron at the same time, it instantly creates a circumstance where you don't know the initial conditions well enough.  

I was just wondering if there is some sort of relationship between the two?

*Side Note*

The double slit theory and especially the delayed choice double slit experiment always talk about the collapse of the wave function and the interference pattern versus double band pattern.  Could chaos theory be involved in this as well?

Question 2- Is a particles quantum state partially derived from spacial or chronal coordinates? If not, why are there so many possible quantum states?

Question 3- How have we come to think that the universe has a radius of 47 billion lightyears? Lets say a photon was cast from the ""edge"" of the universe at the moment of the big bang. Wouldn't that just mean it is 13.7 billion lightyears from the so called edge that it started off on, and the edge itself has moved 13.7 billion lightyears at most. That means that the way i see it,  without compensating for the expansion of space, the maximum distance for the particle horizon would be about 27.5 billion lightyears. I should have probably done the compensation for expansion prior to asking this one, and expansion does seem to be able to compensate for that missing 20 billion, but i am curious as to whether or not there are other things i have looked over.

Question 4- If the original pair to the Hawking Radiation (the particle with negative mass) is being accelerated toward the black hole, why would it not go away from the black hole? Is Hawking radiation so slow because of how unlikely it is for a particle to be thrown rather than pulled in? Or does this involve the beams of particles being expelled from a black hole?"

(ii) In https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02295.pdf, 3rd to last page (pdf pg.162 [screenshot](http://imgur.com/b5Od37A)), they assert the conductance G_{23} is e^2 / h.

(iii) I know that for the topological classification, only the parity of the number of Kramer pairs of edge states intersecting the Fermi level matters.

"can someone here please help me put this to bed? Is it the big bang theory, or is it the big bang theory hypothesis?",12,2,False,False,False,Physics,1499704792,True,"Hi Guys, 

So I have been having this debate over at /r/debatereligion with this Muslim. The gist of it was about what constitutes evidence and how his book is the claim. I said evidence is both observable and repeatable, which, as far as I know is 100% true.

The muslim then responded with what about the big bang theory, to which I replied with what I have always heard to be true, that it is a hypothesis, not a theory.

If this is the case, and I am not mistaken, then I feel that physics may use the word theory in the common way. If this is so, can we really fault believers for using it that way?

Anyway, none of that is my question, but I think it could be relevant.

Anyway, my question is, is the big bang a theory, or a hypothesis?"
Possible phenomena resulting from warping space,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1499707496,True,"This post concerns theory surrounding piece of fictional technology. If this is the wrong kind of post for your sub I apologise.


I am currently in the middle of a world building project for a Sci-Fi novel. I just wanted to ask about the possible implication of a piece of technology I have created for my universe. To avoid issues with relativity, I have decided that the main method for long distance travel would be a drive similar to a Alcubierre Drive which compresses space time so that long distances can be covered in a shorter time without exceeding the speed of light. My civilisation realises that due to economies of scale, it would be much more efficient to create intergalactic 'highways' whereby you place devices at regular intervals between two points in space, with the effect of physically contracting that space, making the Alcubierre drives unnecessary for everyday travel. My question is this, will the create any noteworthy phenomena? What for instance will be the impact on time dilation if you were to move along such a 'highway'. Could it be described with Special relativity or would this warping of space essentially amount to a gravity field where I'd have to bring in General relativity too? I expect that this will have a lens effect for light moving perpendicular or parallel to the 'highway'. Will this produce any observable phenomena? Will ships travelling through or near it be obscured from view for some observers for instance? What would one see if you were in it and what would it look like from outside? 

Also, to what extent is this plausible? Given that there exists technology able to reliably contract space, would this work as a method of travel? Is there some reason why this fundamentally would not be workable?

Thank you for your time.

Question about switching fields in academia,5,3,False,False,False,Physics,1499712712,True,"I finished my undergrad in physics last December, and rather than apply for Ph.D programs I decided to wait a year to save some money and finish the two classes I needed for a math bachelors. I've got a fair amount of experience (~2 years, pretty much non stop) in Li-ion research including a publication, and my advisor (obviously) expects me to continue this sort of work in grad school. He's has been awesome about introducing me to people and opening up doors for me, and I loved the work I was doing in undergrad so I agree with him that it's the smartest move, but the thing that I'm truly passionate about is gravitational field theory which has a comparatively poor job market. I'm fairly confident that I want to continue with Li-ion in grad school, but is it possible to change fields down the road? I've spoken to him about this and he suggested I stick with Li-ion because if I do want to change it's easier to switch to a theory-based field from a lab-based field than the other way around, but I kind of get the impression he doesn't think making a change like that is realistic.

"In what sense is the Lagrangian independent of the coordinates, and why does this independence not carry over to the Hamiltonian?",4,2,False,False,False,Physics,1499719916,True,"I've been self-studying classical mechanics from Goldstein's textbook, and on a number of occasions he refers to the coordinate independence of the Lagrangian. For example, he writes:

>... note that whereas the Lagrangian is uniquely fixed for each system by the prescription [;L = T - V;] independent of the choice of generalized coordinates, the energy function [;h;] [the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of [;q_k;] and [;\dot{q}_k;] ] depends in magnitude and functional form on the specific set of generalized coordinates. For one and the same system, various energy functions [;h;] of different physical content can be generated depending on how the generalized coordinates are chosen. (Section 2.7, p. 63 in international edition)

Here the ""energy function"" is just the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the generalized coordinates and velocities:

[;h(q_1,...,q_n; \dot{q}_1,...,\dot{q}_n; t) = \sum_j \dot{q}_j \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} - L;]

I understand how the magnitude of [;L;] will be invariant under a change of coordinates because [;T;] and [;V;] are physical quantities. However, I do not understand why the functional form of [;L;] is invariant (as the Goldstein implies). For example, wouldn't curvature in the generalized coordinates alter the functional form of [;L;]?

My second question is, what about the energy function (Hamiltonian) spoils this invariance? Is this due to the fact that the generalized coordinates appear explicitly in the definition of [;h;]? I feel like the answer to this question might be obvious to me once I understand what is meant by invariance of L.

How to use Lagrangian mechanics/formalism outside of classical mechanics?,3,3,False,False,False,Physics,1499722607,True,"I've often heard that one of the main advantages of Lagrangian mechanics is that it is highly useful outside of classical mechanics. For example, I've heard it can be useful in quantum mechanics and I've seen Lagrangians appear in advanced economics textbooks. However, I have no idea how one would actually extend Lagrangian mechanics to non-mechanical systems. Since Lagrangian mechanics can be formulated from Hamilton's Principle, my guess is that you somehow derive or postulate that the integral of some function [;L(t,q,\dot{q});] over all possible trajectories in configuration space between two endpoints is stationary along the the actual path followed by the system. Is that the essential idea, or is Lagrangian mechanics extended to systems outside of classical mechanics in some other way?

I jumped around the internet reading articles that were either too simple or too difficult to offer me any solid level of understanding. 

First, they all bring up the Alice/Bob summary to an extent. I was wondering if anyone could help me out with a few questions regarding this. I will be referencing the [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) version if that helps.

Basically, I follow it up until Bob uses quantum gates to transform his particle to a desired state. Why? I thought the point was to figure out what state his particle is in, which he knows once Alice sends him her message. 

I am also having trouble understanding the way measurements work on this level. Comments on the original article mention that one can not choose a state in the begining so one can not send information, it is random of the 4 states every time. Is this true? Or is there a way to purposefully create a certain state to send?

Also, if you have a way to explain the mechanics of an experiment like this in a more simplified manner that would be appreciated.

Unless I am confused, doesn't the change in the spin quantum number have to be zero for a transition to be allowed? And for transition 4, I noticed the change in j is +2, isn't this also forbidden by the selection rules? I feel like I am missing something. Thanks for the help!"

People who have an undergrad in physics and a masters in engineering - what are your jobs like?,3,9,False,False,False,Physics,1499831424,True,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently a high school student looking into a physics undergrad degree, or you would say, a physics major. I love physics, and it's what I enjoy the most, and that's why I've chosen it.

Although, in life, one must prepare for the worst. I'm planning to do a masters in engineering after an undergraduate in physics, and I'm here to listen to everyone who has done this exact thing.

Do you regret switching from physics to engineering?

Do you feel like you earn much better after a masters in engineering?


Anything helpful is welcome. Looking for as many point of views as possible, thank you!"

I programmed a physics simulation where a particle with some initial conditions bounces off the walls of a 2d container. The simulation also includes gravity in the y-coordinates. The aim of the project is to produce a visual animation and further on include more particles and collitions between them. So far,  I have managed to create a list for each coordinate (x and y) plus another list for time. In addition, I have plotted with the aid of matplotlib two graphs, a y-time graph and a ""y velocity""-time graph. Both graphs seem to be correct and very accurate.

I tend to find Reddit is more friendly towards struggling physicists then say physics forum. In that regard, I guess this is the best place to post these kinda of ... well posts. 

So I'm currently in this school for theoretical astrophysics and it seems I may have got here because of political reasons. I'm still a undergrad , I'm entering my senior year. Boy is my education not holding up right now. I kinda feel like a missed a massive opportunity not working up my education on my own and rather relying to my instructors and professors to help me get forward through physics. The main issue of this is during highschool, where I was often told not to achieve anything higher outside the classroom or learn things differently. If I did anything differently or tried to learn on my own , I was told I'm not smart enough to be doing this. They let me take senior year physics in high-school simply because they felt bad for me. I got a B in the class but those people still don't think I'm smart enough for it. 

In my last semester I was basically told I could not do research(as I was doing research) because of one bad test. Most of my professors usually dislike me and strongly dislike my lack of intelligence in immediatley almost any material. It seems for most of my academic life there has been no clear guidance on how I should approach the material and large amounts of unclear and vauge processes are constantly holding me back and forcing me into a constant loop of depression. 

Usually looks like

I meet new teacher. I'am excited for class. Teacher is happy with this and lets me study. I do not so well with material at first. I ask questions, teacher is angry. Later Teacher begins to get so upset with me, any and all questions are answered with a constant negative attitude. 

Even my research professor is starting to get mad at my lack of intelligence almost to the point that he was trying to look for another student to do the research behind my back, told me I wasn't ""interested enough"", does my interest determine my intelligence?. He expects me to be at the same level of knowledge and work capabilities as post-docs and phd students. This makes me wonder, is it bad that I'm not a phd student at 22? 

When I went to other forums to discuss this, most faculty members basically told me, this was my fault, I'm stupid, I should not be in physics, I'm a horrible person, and a professor should be treated with the same moral authority as god. 

I just don't know what to do. It seems the physics community highly devalues people like me. Maybe it has to do with my autism?

If my intelligence is the only sole factor that matters, then what can I do about it? It really its putting a massive strain on me. 

Help would be appreciated :(

EDIT: removed comment on suicide. It was irrelevant.

Thanks to all who replied back to this post. It really helped clarify my position in this matter and will probably help me to be a better physicist in the long run. You won't believe how many vague answers and irrelevant responses I would get from my professors regarding this matter.   "

Implications of Pilot Wave Theory on Time and Energy Uncertainty,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1500052720,True,"I'm wondering if anybody has any EILIUG (Explain It Like I'm UnderGrad?) descriptions, or - please feel free - wild hypothesising with relation to the energy/time uncertainty principle, virtual particles, and what Pilot Wave Theory (/Bohmian Mechanics) might say about these things, or how it might seek to explain them?

From attempting to do some reading on the subject (I struggled to find any particularly good sources), it seems that Pilot Wave Theory interprets the momentum/position uncertainty principle as arising purely from an observer effect and relates to the limitations with which things can accurately be measured (please correct me if this is wrong, or give a more complete description!).

That thesis seems to give little thought to the idea of time/energy uncertainty and the virtual particles that (I understood to) arise as a phenomena of this. 

I know that the position/momentum uncertainty and the time/energy are disconnected in so far as time is not an operator, but I was led to believe - and it seems intuitive - that the two are deeply related.

If we were to take Pilot Wave Theory as given, what might we infer? That virtual particles are an incomplete description? Or should the behaviour of the pilot wave - wherein the wave function itself is a field - be isolated from the behaviour of other quantum fields (e.g. we should isolate our understanding of how it functions for a single wave function from the behaviour of the quantum vacuum more broadly)?

Many thanks!! "
Is true that that the highest velocity possible by an object with mass is V=0.5*C and V0=0.7c ?,6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1500053926,True,"From the Lorentz transformation, that is V=V0*sqrt(1-(v^2 / c^2 ))
calculating the maximum velocities possible would be V0=(sqrt2 / 2)*C but seen as V=0.5C by the observer due to distance dilation(anything more or less than 0.7*C would be seen as lower velocity than 0.5*C due to distance dilation according to Lorentz formula.

I'm asking because I've seen conflicting theories of the maximum speed achievable either being c or 2C or even infinite(something about metric dilation due to very big distance) so I decided to calculate it myself, finding this answers that I have'n seen elsewhere.

Here's the calculation, a extreme of the Lorentz transformation with 1 instead of C, so you would need to multiply the results by C,  F(X) is V/C and X is V0/C:

But when textbooks describe orbitals, for example, as probability density clouds, with regions of high density being the most likely to 'find' the electron, what is meant by the word 'find'?

It was my understanding that quanta aren't actually point particles, but instead excitations of a combination of different quantum fields --  so when a measurement is made, and the wave function 'collapses', what are we finding? Are we just confining the probability amplitude to a smaller region of these fields compared to the unmeasured state?"

Is everyone actually driving a time machine?,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1500154349,True,"Hi there, it's Saturday night and there's maybe a little too much JD&C in me to hold up a sensible end of the conversation, but here goes:

If I understand (read: 'barely grasp') correctly, General Relativity can describe the effects of time dilation experienced by massive objects undergoing acceleration, and suggests that said masses undergoing acceleration will have aged less than those  kept at rest. If that's the case, would these effects be noticeable for the reciprocating pistons in a car engine?

They must pull a lot of g at high rpm, so the woah-dude part of my brain is currently asking: how much younger would my pistons be than the car they just propelled to 100,000 miles?

Lots of assumptions here: average engine speed would be a big one, and what gear ratios you were particularly fond of through the miles, though I suppose what I'm after is a rough idea of whether it's a few nanoseconds or it's more real-world tangible than that, as in the order of half a second or so. 

Thanks for indulging me. No pressure to respond as I might be a tiny bit asleep in a while anyway, though I will be thinking about this as my inner 8 year-old drifts off to the idea of me possessing the keys to a twin-cam 16 valve Flux Capacitor, on my driveway,  and all the possibilities that entails ;-)

It was sunny otherwise and our elevation was about halfway between the cloud and the water which was reflecting a lot of sunlight. The rainbow got larger as we approached the cloud, you had to look almost straight up to see the top of it and could see it arcing down under the plane out of sight. As we flew underneath the cloud I watched the rainbow pass over my head and could see it on either side of the plane. The storm cloud was about 4 miles in diameter and it took about a minute to fly under it. People on a comment thread are telling me this is impossible and I'm making it up or conflating.

Is this paper a valid critique of the MWI?,22,5,False,False,False,Physics,1500300991,True,"[Link](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1010/1010.4767.pdf) and here is the summary:

""The many-world interpretation (MWI), first suggested by Everett, is based solely on
principles deduced from the linear equation-Hilbert space structure of quantum
mechanics. There are no particles or hidden variables and there is no collapse. There
are several simultaneously existing, equally valid versions of reality in the state vector,
each of which contains a version of the observer. Further

• Each version of the observer perceives its respective outcome on every run of
the experiment. Thus, because each version of the observer always perceives,
surely the perceptions of the versions of the observers do not obey the
probability law.

• Only the versions of the observer perceive.

• There is no non-quantum-mechanical observer associated with just one version
of the observer. So you cannot say “I” become version 17 of the observer with
such and such a probability because in the MWI, “I” (including my physical
body and memories) become every version of the observer with 100%
probability.
Since each version of the observer has a valid brain wave function,
corresponding to some pattern of firing neurons, it seems appropriate to assume each
version of the observer is equally “valid.” In that case, the bulleted properties imply
there is no perceiving entity, no “I” in the MWI whose perceptions could be governed
by a probabilistic law. Thus, under the “equal validity” assumption, probability of
perception does not exist in the MWI.

The “equal validity” assumption can be defended by using the linearity property.
But even if we assume non-equal validities—sometimes the brain wave function can be
“consciously aware,” sometimes not—for the various versions of the observer, linearity
still implies the probability law cannot hold. Thus the linear many-worlds
interpretation proposed by Everett is not an acceptable interpretation. Some
modification of it, such as collapse or hidden variables or perhaps even a fundamental
difference between inanimate objects and sentient beings, must be added to account for
the probability law."""

I have a question concerning: fan dynamics, air flow, pressure systems, and suction.

I work at a fairly down-to-earth body shop.

Our exhaust system as it stands is a 20in, 5400cfm fan with a 20x20in fiberglass filter.

The small surface area is causing the filter to clog up with paint particles very quickly, and as a result we're forced to change the filter every 3 minutes!

So, we decided to build a filter box. 

We made a box 8'x2'x3' with an open front (the 8'x3' side)

We built a sealed box around the fan 30""x30""

We then plumbed the two boxes together with an 8in pipe.

Here's a diagram: http://i.imgur.com/7olbLq2.jpg

We finished construction today (sans the filter blanket), however it doesn't work at all.

The fan seems to have been restricted too much. No suction at all.

So, I need some help. Some formulas so I can try to crunch numbers myself (I'm not much of a physics guy, but I can math somewhat!), Advice, or really anything.

Thanks so much for reading!

Need advice for choosing particle physics project,6,1,False,False,False,Physics,1500437760,True,"Hi, I'm at a point where I need to decide between three particle physics projects and I'm not really sure which one to pick. One of them is about particle reconstruction at Belle II and the problems that go wrong with that and how to fix them. The other is about using simulated data from Belle II to look at the rates for semileptonic decays and if it can tell us something about the fundamental parameter of the SM. 

I'm not sure which one to go with cause I find both of them interesting. I decided to go with the one that would be the most useful in terms of skills learned. Like I know that the second one teaches you about decays and SM but the first one teaches how to correctly reconstruct events and that also seems pretty important for particle physicists. 

Does anyone have any advice about which one might be better for someone who wants to do experimental particle physics?? I know the info is not much to go on (and sorry if this is a stupid question) but I figured I might as well ask here in case anyone is able to help. Thanks! :)"
Electron and neutron degeneracy question,2,3,False,False,False,Physics,1500439209,True,"There may be more math to this question than I am ready for but here goes...

Under the gravitational pressure in the core of white dwarfs/neutron stars, degeneracy pressure balances out the force to prevent collpse to the next state of stellar remnant.  As these particles compress and so forth, they start moving at significant fractions of lighspeed which, according to relativity, should increase mass of the particles.

Would this increase the total mass of the remnant sufficiently (depending on original mass) to cause a further collapse without the accretion of additional matter?"

Introducing /r/arXiv_Plus,36,164,False,False,False,Physics,1500479587,True,"/r/arXiv_Plus is a new subreddit dedicated to helping scientists and science enthusiasts find papers that might interest them on arXiv.

A resource like this has become necessary due to the massive influx of papers that arXiv receives each year (over 100,000), making it difficult for readers to find which papers best suite their interests. By introducing Reddit's voting system, users can effectively curate arXiv, improving everyone's experience with it.

/r/arXiv_Plus encourages readers to submit any papers they find that they consider to be well written and of note within their respective field. When making a submission, there is a full suite of post flairs available to allow users to more easily find papers that may interest them. In addition to that, there is a set of six buttons on the sidebar, allowing for users to filter all posts by physics, mathematics, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, computer science, and statistics (so if I only want to see papers on statistics, I would click the ""statistics"" button).

Only links that direct to arXiv.org are permitted (and no URL shorteners).

I have taken the liberty of preparing an example post on the subreddit already.

The subreddit includes a monthly sticky post for aiding users in finding papers that they recall reading, but cannot find. Papers from all sources are permitted, but arXiv links are most encouraged.

There is an automoderator customized to assure a safe and professional environment for everyone, but moderator positions are open to anyone who believes that they have something to contribute to /r/arXiv_Plus as a moderator (\*cough* CSS wizards).

Thank you, and happy reading! I hope to see you around on /r/arXiv_Plus!

The classes were great and all but nothing ever intrigued me. I haven't taken University Physics yet but I do like the concept of exploring how everything gets done and how things work is. I know what you're gonna say, ""isn't that what engineers do?"" In some cases yes, but I doubt there's a job market for actual knowing the theories and problem solving of how things work in the universe. The job market for an engineer is sitting at a desk doing paper work, or like me (mechanical) working at the rigs with my dad. To be honest, I would much rather learn a specific subject like physics and understands the ins and out of it, than to be a jack of all trades as an engineer. For me it's much harder to understand a lot of things at once (engineering classes etc.), than to master one subject I really don't mind being challenged at. Anyways enough with my RANT. I was wondering if you guys can give me any tips on how to explain to my parents what kind of jobs there are out there for physics majors.

Physics degree regrets and career advice,17,8,False,False,False,Physics,1500502675,True,"I graduated about two months ago from a decent school with bachelors in both physics and math. Throughout my undergraduate, I did everything that I thought was right to put me on the path towards a physics PhD and a career in academia. I exhausted the majority of my school's undergraduate physics courses as well as some graduate courses. I involved myself in research early, which resulted in two summers of funded work that culminated in a few conference presentations as well as a paper in review with myself as first author. 

However, at the start of my senior year, I started to realize that the future life of academia was not what I wanted, and I opted out of applying to graduate programs. I applied for a few jobs in the Boston area (where I attended school), but ultimately decided that I wanted to be closer to friends and family. So, after I graduated I moved back home to the Mid-Atlantic where I've been trying to start my career. I figured that the skills I had picked up from my degree such as programming in a few languages, general data analysis, mathematical ability, and strong problem solving and research skills would make me a good candidate, but I haven't found this to be true in reality.

Thus far, I've barely been able to get interviews for positions. I was recently rejected from what I felt to be a promising software engineering job on the (very reasonable) basis that they were looking for someone who had more coding experience such as a traditional CS degree. As a result of my struggles, I can't help but think that most of the decisions that I've made over the past four years have been a mistake. 

Searching through job listings it has been hard to find positions that desire bachelors in physics or math--if any positions do want those types of degrees, it's typically at the graduate level or higher. Software engineering, data analysis, and other technical positions that are more common seem to be elusive due to my lack of practical experience that one would get from a more traditional degree or a summer internship. Although I feel like I possess the capacity to quickly learn on the job and be productive in such positions, on paper it's not easy to convince potential employers that that is the case. Since I moved away from where I went to school, I have very few connections to help get my foot in the door, which has resulted in the feeling that most of my applications are simply falling towards an event horizon.

Have any of your been in a position similar to mine and would like to offer me some advice? I don't want to conclude that physics, which I passionately loved throughout undergrad, was a waste of time and a detriment to my future."

A question about superspeed.,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1500560404,True,"I had this showerthought before I went to sleep yesterday.

Imagine somebody has superspeed, quicksilver or flash. Everything is in super slowmotion for them.

What if they step on grass in superspeed? Would they be walking on the top of the grass, or would the grass just get pushed down as normal? 

First I was thinking that they would walk on the tip of the grass straws because they would move before they got pushed down. But then I thought that power is related to speed considering newtons second law, and the faster you go, the stronger your steps are. Wouldn't the grass get pushed down like normal as you step on it in superspeed? Unless there's a delay on the force and you are able to move before it happens?"
How can you explain how adding more foam pads(with a bit of elasticity) will increase the final velocity of a ball dropped onto it versus when it is dropped onto 1 pad alone.

I am wondering how there is less energy lost with more pads since the final velocity of the ball is greater, the energy is higher and closer to the original value before ball drop.

I've always thought quantum mechanics to be interesting with various stuff like quantum super position and quantum decoherence. helps that the terms sound cool.

on to the question. from my understanding particles are able to have multiple and sometimes contradictory properties when not being observed. can't this all be explained by looking at higher dimensions?

according to some theories I've read all of time exists together. which means the past, present and the future all exist together. it's just us who perceive time to have a linear flow. if you bring multiverses into the fold, then all of time and space and all possibilities all exist at once.

let me try to explain the picture a bit. when looking at a 2d object we are able to perceive all of it at the same time but that isn't the same as a 3d object. we cannot see around it to the back. when not observing a 3d object all of it exists in an equal state of ""un-observation"" but when looking at it all we perceive is a partial version of the object. when observing the universe around us all we perceive is a partial version of the higher dimension, so our specific timeline and our specific occurrences (possibilities). 

so cant most things ""quantum"" be explained by this? I could not find anything about this anywhere on the internet and thought that it was an interesting topic."

Convert Watts or BTU to Degrees fahrenheit (Please read explanation),5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1500615033,True,"     Hello, I need to figure out how to take the Watts or BTU of a heater, and figure out the output temperature for a given CFM (cubic feet per minute.) One year of Reddit gold to the person who can help me solve my problem.

     My company got a contract to paint these big tanks (6' round by 10' tall.)  When I sourced paint for the tanks, I specifically ordered a paint that did not need to be heat treated.  The salesman assured me the product I got did not need it.  After we painted them they looked terrible, so I read through the documents for the product, and in the fine print it said it must be heated to 350 degrees for 30 minutes...

     Shipping them somewhere isn't really a option.  I built a giant 12' tall x 7' diameter oven out of sheet metal and insulation (it is glorious, I attached the insulation with baling wire, and wrapped it with aluminum foil, I can post a picture when it's done if anyone is interested), but I haven't figured out exactly how I'm going to heat it.  I have a salamander heater that puts out enough heat, but I'm concerned that the exhaust fumes might mess with the paint, and if we had to redo it, it would be really bad.  So I would like to use a heater that is indirect fire, or electric.

     My problem is that when you go to buy heaters, they don't tell you the output temperature.  You just get BTU's or Watts and CFM.  I tried to google how to make the conversion and everyone just says you can't convert BTU's or Watts to temperature, which I realize, but I feel like if you add CFM to the equation it is possible, I just don't know how to do it.  If I could just get a formula with a couple of example problems I can probably figure out the rest and find the heater I need, provided it is not super complicated math.

     So for example, if you have a 15,000 Watt heater, and it blows 500 CFM of air, and the ambient temperature is 100 degrees, how hot will the air be on the output side?  Also what would the output be if it's 15,000 Watt and 750 CFM?  What about 20,000 and 500 CFM?"

Medical Physics vs. Experimental High Energy Physics?,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1500823243,True,"Hey guys, I hope this sort of question is accepted here. I just graduated with an H.B.Sc in astrophysics and I'm starting graduate school in the fall. I was initially planning on going into experimental high energy physics (I've done a few research projects with ATLAS and the T2K and I know that I love totally love HEP, and I feel like I have a good idea of what it entails) however, I've recently found out that I also have the option of going into Medical Physics (it's the same department as physics, so no separate application required, and it's CAMPEP accredited).

So now I'm really torn. I don't know a lot about medical physics because at my current university the physics and Medical Physics departments are separate, so I only know what I've found through googling. However, I feel really passionate about health and medicine, and was considering medical school for a bit, but I liked physics too much to make the change. Medical physics sort of seems like the best of both worlds.

But I have some concerns.. I hear medical physics doesn't involve a lot of math or ""real"" physics, which is sort of sad for me to hear. On the other hand, it may be easier to get a job in medical physics than HEP (assuming I got a residency position) and medical physics may directly impact people's lives more, which I really like.

Does anyone in either of these fields have any advice, info on what medical physics in grad school is like, or info on the job market for each field? I know there are similarities between med phys and HEP, but I'm sort of worried about losing touch with real physics if I go into med phys. But I might just feel this way because I don't know a lot about it. Any suggestions/information/comments welcome!

**TL;DR:** starting grad school in the fall initially planning on specializing in experimental HEP but recently found out about medical physics. Loves medicine and is very intrigued but worried about the lack of math/""real"" physics. Confused and torn, and curious about job prospects. :( "

Question about wind dynamics,2,6,False,False,False,Physics,1500903216,True,"Note sure if this is the right place to ask. 

I have a question about wind dynamics, and especially about wind dynamics in front of a large obstacle. Specifically, I am wondering about the effects of wind on islands. Look at [this example](http://imgur.com/a/m7lR3) of the typical trade winds present in the Canary Islands. The wind direction is denoted by the small black vectors, and background color denotes wind strength. As you can see, wind direction is northeast going southwest, but there is large patch of reduced wind **in front** of each island. This seems rather weird to me, because I would have expected wind speed to be the same everywhere up until it hits the obstacle. Is this related to a built up a airpressure **in front** of the obstacle? Another issue is the increased wind between islands, which I think can be explained by a kind of funnel effect. 

Anyway hope anybody can explain this to me, or at least point me in the right direction.

However, after doing some calculations based on my high school honors physics class, I found that would, indeed work. All you would need is for the receiving side to be .406391m lower than the starting point.


However, as I said, I've only had one year of high school physics. I'm not sure how much of the work I did was correct, and how much could be improved.


So here's what I did:

**WHAT WE KNOW**

The bus was moving at 70mph

It had to jump a gap of 50ft

A bus weighs about 40,000lbs


*so*

v=31.2928m/s

x=15.24m

m=18143.695kg


*we can assume*

The ramp may have about a 5% grade

θ=2.85°



**PROCESS**

I drew our classic triangle, with a bus on the hypotenuse. Since it's a hypothetical triangle, I'm measuring each side in m/s.

(vy is vertical velociy, vx is horizontal velocity)

sinθ = vy/v

sin2.85° = vy/31.2928

vy = 1.55592m/s

vy^2 +vx^2 = 31.2541m/s

So there are the components


Then, to find time:

t=xx/vx

t=15.24/31.2541

t=.48762s


And, finally, the change in height

xy=viy*t + 1/2*a*t^2

xy=1.55592*.48762 + 1/2*-9.8*.48762^2

xy=-.406391m

Δx=.406391m



So yeah, I tried that and got an answer that looks lower than I thought it would be, but it seems right. If anyone could point out  any mistakes I made or anything in general, that would be great!

Sources: 
The movie *Speed*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_standards - The maximum grade permitted is 6%, so I chose something a little bit lower since I can't really tell in the movie...

**As a follow-up**, what is your stance on physics in movies? Do you think it's important for a movie to obey all laws of physics, or is storytelling and plot more important? Can you think of any movies with excellent physics, or terrible physics?

I turned 30 today and am going back to school to finish my B.S. in Finance this year. I have worked in sales management for seven years and need an undergrad to advance in my current career. This decision, compounded by my age and the inevitable fear of regrets that go along with it, is weighing heavily on my mind. All of my life I have had a deep passion for cosmology. This passion has led to reading many books on the subject and many hours spent watching YouTube lectures. Circumstances 10 years ago forced me to forgo college and pursue a job in sales, which has led me to a rather well paying and successful career. I am overwhelmed by the fear that if I continue down this path motivated solely by money and the high I get from closing deals that I will feel empty inside. My other fear is that I am just too old to pursue a career in physics. The physics department advisors at my university of course tell me I'm not too old, but I need objective advice. Conveniently my local school has a Planetary Sciences track PhD program. 

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, thank you! 

TL;DR I feel really old and am weighing the fear of regret against the fear of being done with school at 40 years old, and not making as much money as I can on my current career path.

Formal education vs Autodidacticism for learning physics,8,0,False,False,False,Physics,1501037954,True,"This discussion is in 1st and 2nd world countries (3rd world doesn't count). This applies to all forms of physics (no matter what kind of school/university). I'm human so if I miss some examples tell me down below. PS by physics I mean all types.

Pros and cons of ""Formal Education"".

Pros:
1.The students gets credit(Degrees,job,etc)
2.The students has help from the professionals,friends,etc..
3.The student can get advice from professors or teachers.
4.The student has a better leaning environment (school campus,classes,etc)
5.The student has the good tools and resources.

Cons:
1.The student must keep up (in class) or risk falling behind.
2.The student gets test (in my opinion not a good way to show what you know)
3.The student can't learn at his/her pace.
4.The student must pay for college or university education. (or if has a scholarship this does not apply) 
5.The student must stick to a schedule (not flexible)

Pros and cons of Autodidacticism

Pros:
1.This person can learn at his/her pace.
2.This person ""might"" be more creative and produce more abstract ideas (can think of ideas with no limit even if wrong)
3.This person can just buy paper and pencil (go to library or use Internet for formulas) other than that its cheaper.
4.The person might be very motivated (study hard and have little to no reward in the short term)
5.This person can have more time to study and learn material, flexible (in college/university must take more classes) 

Cons:
1.The student has little to no support from anyone.
2.The person has a low chance of being successful. Creating new formulas,theory's,etc (Depends)
3.If the person fails him/her gets no reward/recognition (its all or nothing)
4.The person does not have the best sources for study (depends on types of books or websites)
5.The person might have to work full time and be tried (most likely poor)

I'm worried my physics education is missing a lot of things,20,5,False,False,False,Physics,1501065826,True,"I feel like this should probably go in the 'Education and Careers' thread, but it's kinda long for a comment. 

I'm in my final (3rd) year of an undergraduate degree with physics and applied maths at a mediocre university in Australia. After talking to students who study at other universities both here in Aus and overseas, I think my degree is going to be quite lacking in comparison. 

By the time I graduate, I would have done only 11 classes in physics, with 2 of those being optional classes that really didn't go into much quantitative detail (3 optional classes in all, but one was hard). I would have done classes in:

 - astrophysics

 - (very) basic quantum mechanics

 - electromagnetism

 - solid state physics

 - lower level thermodynamics

 - dynamical systems

 - mechanics

 - and a few things in passing, e.g. kinetic theory, materials, optics (only for a couple of weeks each)

Notice that I will not have done any classes dedicated to atomic physics or nuclear physics, or fluid mechanics. 

When looking at the materials from other universities, so much of the work seems way above what I've seen. I know that having a degree will imply that I know all of the usual stuff, but I don't think that's going to be the case. 

It's far too late for me to transfer somewhere else so this is the education I'm going to have when I graduate. How can I make up for everything my transcript/degree will lack? Will I even have a chance at surviving grad school (and academia in general) overseas given what I've learnt?

Is gravity just magnetism?,20,0,False,False,False,Physics,1501074647,True,"I always wondered what causes gravity. Is it God? Is it quarks?... Whats the point of earths magnetic field (besides blocking radiation). What causes planets have an magnetic field? Anyways, I think I figured it out, not only explain why earth has a magnetic field, but actually HOW EARTH WAS FORMED and WHAT IS GRAVITY. 


Now this may seem crazy at first, you are probably wanting to ask me ""why does gravity attract non-magnetic elements"" - well then I ask you - why cant you take magnetic metals to the south pole and have them stick to the south pole. A great analogy of this is centrifugal force. Can you explain why you travel outwards if you spin very fast on something and stand on the outside? Why not the inside where its the fastest? Please read.


**So why DOES earth have a magnetic field**: Is there a giant magnet in the center of the earth? Well yes. Consider as an example that the that the creation of earth (and all planets for that matter) was made by individual atoms of neodymium in space attracting to one another building up a magnetic field, then attracting metals along with neodymium. This is possibly how it formed. 





**Alright, now whats the relation to gravity? Why cant I make myself stick to a magnet?** Imagine protons are the plus side. Take a look at the first and second lightest element on earth - Hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. It is the ONLY molecule that can ESCAPE earths gravitational field (coincides with earths magnetic field), and actually permanently travel AWAY from earth. Now helium doesn't escape, stops at the stratosphere. It has a postive and negative side to it so it doesnt push away.


**Alright then.. this makes sense (kind of), but why don't I attract to magnets?**: Same reason a metal stick wont force itself to the . Think of what happens if you stick 2 magnets together, [they become one big magnet](https://i.stack.imgur.com/usrS7.png), but they HAVE to reach the outer end of the pole, otherwise there is no magnetic force (for all you newbies out there: sort of like an electrical circuit, you need a plus and a minus).



Now imagine you had one big magnet, as in extremely big, and one small one. How would the magnetic field look like? You would not be able to have the negative side reach the positive side.




**If I'm magnetic what allows me to flip upside down, why dont I always stay up**: Same as iron, attach iron to a magnet and flip it, it will still work. While the number of protons is greater then the number of electrons you have, that number of protons is equal all around you (ie: you have 5 protons and 1 electron on the top half of yourself (figuratively), and 5 protons and 1 electron on the bottom. You dont have 10 protons on one side and 1 on the other.


**So why doesn't the earth turn into a black hole?**

If the force inside earth is so strong, why don't the earths magnets collapse and force a black hole? All the magnets that are on the earths crust. What do I mean by that? [Pretty much this](https://youtu.be/LyvfDzRLsiU?t=1m43s). The outer force of the small magnets reach the inner force of the big magnets instead of making contact with the outer force.



**WHY THE EARTH SPINS**: Consider what happens if you attatch a 9V battery to the positive end and the negative end of a magnet. It spins. What are magnets anyways? Spin of electrons. Now look at the magnetic field of earth. Where does the EMF attract. Consider what happens with batteries now imagine Teslas wireless electricity. All those gamma rays and x-rays from the sun - they get absorbed by the north and south pole to earths center magnetic thingy which makes the earth spin. 


Also, even oxygen is magnetic, liquid oxygen that is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcGEev8qulA. Reason? More oxygen is compressed in one area.



Pretty much: [individual electrons spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-factor_(physics) = inward pull of electrons,everything spinning (as in the case of playground marry-go-rounds) = outward pull of electrons inward of protons.


also this is interesting: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/dark-star-diaries/confirmed-black-holes-are-magnetism-powered-eating-machines/


oh and lastly: about venus: gravity exists on there because it is part of the suns magnetic field and it collects the magnetism from the sun. "

Light doesnt interact with gravity the same way objects of mass do. objects are directly influenced by gravity in spacetime being pulled to one another as the mass and force is stronger. And as i understand it light isnt ""pulled"" or sucked"" in by gravity although it can appear to be because while traveling in a straight line objects of mass warp spacetime and those photons still traveling in a straight line dip when entering the vicinity of the gravitational force. Similar to if you drew a straight line diagonally on a cube and then continued that line as you traveled along all of the faces it may appear to bend but is in fact still going straight.

All of that being said the way i understand a black hole is not that gravity pulls light and its not that light ""cant escape"" its simply that light is forever traveling into this hole. kind of like when you take a quarter and roll it on one of those funnels at the mall. you roll it straight but light only has one way to go. down. because of its immense mass deeply warping space time around it. which leads me to believe that a black hole is a legit hole not this magical wonky monster ""eating"" everything.

I got my B.S in physics from UCSB and did fairly well grade-wise, graduating with high honors and an award from my department of physics for doing well in upper division classes.

I stuck with it because it was tough and pushed me but I never questioned ""what next,"" I focused on the academic material and divested my other time into working as a tutor for my university and as a grader for other physics classes. I found research work in HEP working on organic plastic scintillators for muon tomography. 

What I'm getting at here is that I have a B.S. in physics and absolutely no experience in anything practical. All of my interests were purely academic and I just feel so lost trying to find a job. I am too afraid to go to grad school because I just don't think I'm cut out for what I originally planned to do (try to become a professor) and I am immensely stressed over paying off my student loans. 

Every job that seems mildly interesting is looking for someone with multiple years of experience in some specific, APPLIED, field of physics and/or higher education credentials.

Big Bang vs. Big Crunch,8,5,False,False,False,Physics,1501223719,True,"Since the Big Bang, the universe has continued to expand.  Some theorize that the energy unleashed is infinite and thus the universe will expand indefinitely.  Others theorize that the energy will eventually run out, leading the universe to contract in the Big Crunch.

If gravitational forces were to cause the universe to collapse back into itself, what are the possible outcomes?  

1. Would the contraction turn the universe into a black hole?  

2. Could the crunch create another explosion of energy and set off another Big Bang?  Does this mean the universe could be in a perpetual loop, going from bang to crunch, and, if so, would each resulting Big Bang be smaller or larger than the previous?

Advice on undergraduate physics degree,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1501468441,True,"Hello r/Physics!

I am not sure if this sub normally receives posts of this nature, but I hope some of you will be able to help me.

I'm a rising senior from Canada with the intention of majoring in Physics. I am not sure if I should study in Canada or if it is worth it to go to the US or UK. 

Based on my stats, extracurriculars, etc., I am relatively confident that the best programs I will get into are at Berkeley and Oxford/Cambridge. Since ECs are my weak point (no research/internship),  I doubt I will get into anything a tier higher (e.g. MIT, Princeton). Thus, my target unis will all be need-aware for international applicants, since the need-blind counterparts (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT) are all reaches for me. As an international applicant already, applying with financial aid will make it almost impossible for me to get in to those target schools either. So I am planning on applying without financial aid.

In this case, based on my research, I will have to pay between $53K (CAD) to $69K in tuition/college fees annually. (Oxford/Cambridge are cheaper however because their 4-year programs award both a bachelor's and master's at the end.)  This increases the cost of my undergrad degree by, literally, a factor of 10, since studying in Canada will only cost between $5000 and $6500 annually. My family's financial situation is, I would say, average or a bit below, so it certainly cannot afford the full cost of an American or British education. I would need to take very significant loans to fund it. 

If I do take a loan to pay for an education at Berkeley/Oxford/Cambridge, is it feasible that I would get a good enough job with my undergrad physics degree to pay off my loans? If not, is there another way to pay it off?

Another factor is that my aspiration is, first and foremost, to become a professor of physics. Thus, I will definitely pursue graduate studies. Obviously, the undergraduate institution will not be as influential as my graduate institution(s) in reaching this position of professor. This brings me to question whether paying $200K for undergrad alone is worth it if it might not really matter in the end. As well, how difficult is it to get into a top institution, like MIT or Princeton, for a master's degree and PhD if I do my bachelor's at somewhere like the University of Toronto?

Sorry for the long post. If anyone would be able to offer advice on any component of this situation I would be very grateful. 

Thanks!

I thought physics was exactly what I want to do for many years but now I feel stuck. I have a hard time connecting with the people in my classes/research. I am extroverted so it is hard for me when I can't find many people who are similar to me. Also, I'm not as interested in the subject anymore. I no longer read material outside of the classroom or keep up with physics news. I think I might be happier in some type of engineering. Possibly systems engineering..

I don't know what the best route for me would be. I have intentions of graduating with a physics degree and applying to grad school for engineering. I don't know what type of masters program would accept me given that I had only taken physics and math classes. 

It's hard for me to accept that I am 'giving up' on physics. I guess it's not right for me because I am no longer happy or excited in the major...

Did anyone else have a similar experience? Any advice would be helpful!

Elaborate on the connection between SO(3) representation theory and physical quantum numbers?,5,9,False,False,False,Physics,1501474541,True,"If this sounds especially dense, or if I state something wrong in this, I apologize in advance.

I've studied group theory on my own for a while now, albeit on-and-off (job hunt that only ended recently), and have recently been reviewing my knowledge of partial differential equations over the past week, especially Laplace/Poisson and how it applies to E&M + QM. In the hydrogen atom problem, the two merge. I feel like I'm generally understanding each in isolation, but not as a unified whole. (Or am I?) A spin ""l"" representation in SO(3) corresponds to a specific Legendre polynomial, and thus a given set of spherical harmonics-and physically corresponds to a certain energy orbital. But what about the magnetic quantum number? Do we just arbitrarily set a higher limit on the ""l"" representation? How do Fermi-Dirac statistics manifest in all of this, when it comes to spin? All of the quantum numbers combined add up to a unique Hilbert space

I don't know. I feel like I've got too many questions to ask. I'm just having a hard time putting it altogether and making it ""click"" together intuitively as a whole, even though I feel like I understand both mathematical perspectives (group theoretical, analytical) in isolation. So, this isn't so much a question so much as a desire for explanation. I feel kind of bad about posting this because this is a rather badly formed question, so if anybody here wants me to take this down, just ask. "

Help me understand Landauer's Principle,1,7,False,False,False,Physics,1501487300,True,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer's_principle

Particularly, it's this combination of phrases in the ""Rationale"" section that I find misleading/ambiguous when I read it:

>if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than originally (total entropy has not decreased).

>Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an ""observer"" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The first sentence implies that if we were to reduce the number of possible number of ""logical states"" of a computation (by erasing a bit, say), the maximum multiplicity of the system will have decreased (ie. entropy will have decreased), which is forbidden. Therefore, the total number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state (eg. the possible states of all energy quanta present on all the transistor gates representing the logical state) must have gone up by an at least compensating amount (eg. the system heated up as a result of the bit erasure by an amount equal to the loss of entropy from the bit erasure).

The next sentence goes on to imply for an observer keeping track only of the logical state but not the physical state, the number of possible physical states has increased, and therefore entropy has increased.

But, and this is what creates misunderstanding for me, I thought the first sentence had established that the *increase* in possible physical states per logical state could have been exactly compensating for the loss of the bit, which had its own number of possible physical states, and thus the total possible physical states could be *exactly the same* as before, leading to no increase in entropy as the result of erasing a bit. This counteracts the entire idea of Landauer's Principle which is that erasing a bit releases a minimum amount of entropy.

I can see a way out of this if what is meant to be understood is that the rise in number of possible physical states per logical state applies also to the bit that has now been erased and not only to those bits which remain inside the system (to keep the system's change in entropy >= 0), thus leading to a release of entropy into a surrounding system -- namely, that system which is kept track of through its physical states and not its logical states. This makes some sense since that physical device (transistor, say), still exists after the bit has been erased, and could easily have been heated as a result of the operation.

Am I understanding any of this?"
Could we give our civilization infinite time by using time dilation?,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1501500156,True,"In theory, if we moved the entire human civilization somewhere where time passes drastically faster (relative to what we consider to be the ""normal"" time of the Universe) due to time dilation, say, very close (but not deadly close) to a massive black hole, we could give ourselves *much* more time to be here in the Universe, thus having more time to evolve ourselves as species, our knowledge of physics and the Universe, and our technology. 

It wouldn't really be as we would become a species from the future faster since in our own perspective time would pass at the same pace as always, but everything around us would pass at a slower pace.

Having this would protect our civilization from the dangers of outside, from the death of the universe, maybe give us more time to research so advanced technologies we would not even dream with within the amount of time the Universe gives to us on the Earth. We could discover how to stop the end of the Universe, how to jump to other Universes, etc.

I'm not saying I am worried about how much time left we have, I know it' so much time that it's inconceivable to our mind, but having more could be better. And also it's a good theoretical idea to discuss."

High School Physics Teacher Looking for Project Ideas!,4,4,False,False,False,Physics,1501513717,True,"Hello!

I teach high school physics to juniors and was hoping to incorporate more summative projects for students that involve some sort of hands on designing and building. Ideally, they should take up at least 2 days and should be focused on a certain physics concept. Bonus points if they have some sort of real life application to them.

A classic example would be like designing and building a contraption for an egg to survive a fall. We redesigned the project to designing and building a small egg car so the egg survived a crash from a ramp. Then we could incorporate real life elements such as the purpose of airbags, seatbelts, crumple zones, etc. as well as the physics concepts of momentum and impulse.

Some more big projects that I already do are building mobiles and analyzing torque equilibrium, building bungee cords and analyzing spring constants and using conservation of energy to determine stretch length, and building flashlights as an intro to circuits.

So I would love any ideas on projects that you might have done in high school that you really liked, that you've seen done, or that you came up on the spot! Thanks in advance!

The effect of gravity travels instantaneously, correct? So if the sun suddenly vanished it's force of gravity would instantly cease. Assuming this is the case, how does the ""information"" (don't know how else to describe it) from the force of gravity travel faster than the speed of light? I suspect this has something to do with general relativity and the fabric of space-time. Like if there is an object 10 billion light years away and it's position changes, won't that objects gravitational effect instantly change on me (no matter how infinitesimal that effect is)? How does the information travel 10 billion light years instantly?"

Redshift Question,14,29,False,False,False,Physics,1501939708,True,"The astronomical phenomenon of redshift is supposed to be caused by galaxies and stars moving away from us due to the expansion of space.

In the increase in space (per unit of distance) results in an object seeming to move away from us. The relationship is such that the farther away the object is, the faster it moves away. This velocity results in a doppler effect whe the light spectrum of those objects is shifted downwards (a lower frequency).

So what I'm wondering is how does the expansion of space carry the stars and galaxies farther apart relative to each other as space itself expands?

Classic Newtonian physics says that space is just a physical volume without a direct connection to matter (You can't push/pull against it, it can't push pull against you).

Apparently, redshift says it can. Am I missing something here? If so, can someone explain how this works?"

(I know many of you will frown upon this and I am with you, however I do not have much choice in the matter as I was originally brought on as a bio/chem teacher and its made things weird. As a friend said it's better that I teach the class because I care about the students and want to put out a high quality product rather than someone else who may be slightly more qualified but could care less. Essentially I am between a rock and a hard place but I digress). My questions are as follows:

If you teach at the high school level what book do you use, do you like this book? If so why do you like it?

What are your go-to lab assignments that really drive home the concepts and really get your students to pay attention. Or as a student what physics lab assignments stood out to you as effective and inspiring?

What topics of physics do you find to be the most engaging and relevant that will inspire students to find meaning in physics?

What are a few major recent breakthroughs in the field? Is there a way to discuss these topics without getting to deep and confusing the students and myself?

Lastly what would you want in your physics class, what have other teachers failed to do or what do you wish you could have known?

I really want to do the best for these kids so that they can not only do well in college, but so they can develop a deep respect and appreciation for a wonderful area of science."

[simple mechanics question] minimum energy to move an object?,4,2,False,False,False,Physics,1502096623,True,"Okay, so I'm trying to wrap my head around this, but W=Fd, so say you want to move a box up 100kg 10m, sure, F=100kg\*9.81m/s^2 => 981N*10m = 9810J.

But that's not realistic, is it. If i want to move an object from rest, I first need to apply more force than needed to just keep it still, so until I've accelerated the object to some velocity, I'm going to be exerting more force.

Following this, the less force over the amount needed to counteract gravity for less time means less overall energy expended. So is the implication here that the least energy is used if we accelerate the object by an infinitesimally small amount and then move at that infinitesimal velocity for an infinite amount of time?

Are weather systems deterministic or is there something inherently unknowable about them?

Is this true or does the uncertainty principle prohibit us from knowing the exact location and position of these molecules.

Undergraduate in need of advice,10,3,False,False,False,Physics,1502110328,True,"Some context: currently in an MSci physics course (4 year course in which 4th year consists of masters level modules and research) at [a high-ranking British university] about to go into 3rd year. Quite lost/worried about future prospects.

It may be worth mentioning first that I went into physics with a generally deep interest, i.e I'm not extremely passionate about a particular field but liked most of what I came across. At this point, I was particularly considering a path in particle physics for my 4th year.

Onto the issue. As accumulated from discussions with my peers, the Internet and reddit of course, I have began to doubt what potential (realistic) career paths I had available after graduation. Is particle physics acceptable? Or do I follow other interests that may be potentially fruitful such as environmental physics or material science? 

I understand the difficulty in obtaining academic jobs, especially without a PhD. I would probably consider a PhD after I experience research in 4th year. 

Bottom line: for one that hopes for a job that keeps things interesting and fresh whilst still providing a stable income - is this a realistic goal to reach for? Are there modules in particular fields that are worth taking solely because they offer a wide range of career prospects?

"What's your motivation/ why did you still choose Physics major undergrad, grad although you know it will be harsh",1,4,False,False,False,Physics,1502117977,True,"[Read details]
Currently I'm a international senior student who just participate the physics olympiad (I'm not showing off or anything, I'll tell further reasons why)

I intend to pursue Physics major as my brother is also pursuing grad school at a top university here. But it seems I should  do Engineering/CS Major and then Minor Physics (hopefully to increase employablity), as I have a little experience in programming a little C++ (competitve programming) and Java( self studied a little), I have already read through some CS books so I think it would be ""easier"" for me to get a CS. (maybe)

So about my past, I'm quite luckly that I got interested in science especially physics but at that time I was still reading so pop science books( Now I know they don't really show us how ""real"" physics research are done, but anyways it had help me to keep an interest for it).

So I think in grade 10(quite late) I started to try participating contest in order to see my limit, whether I really like Physics in general or not. Although I feel ""lost"" at that time but fortunately I was serious enough to train very hard, thanks to my wonderful teachers I obtain quite well knowledge as well as have some insight how real physics reasearch are done.

I know I might be ok at problem-solving but i still hugely lack skills in doing research( although I've never done it, but it seems really harsh for me). But there's something in me that wanted to do it(hopefully I won't get depressed if it turns out a failure at university).

So the actual question here that I want to end the debate for students who are interested like me
 1)How should I know that depsite all those harsh things people face in uni, grad school still pursue physics, that I should still do.( Ỏ how did you guys ""overcome it"".
2) As I'm applying US colleges so I've to do gap year , I hopefully want to spend some time ""preparing"", try some courses how it is, what main things should I consider ( train mind, knowledge skills). I don't want to burn out fast and then have to regret to change major.
3)I've heard rumors that in uni, out of ten people wanted to do research in theoritical physics it turns out only one will actually pursue to grad school and most people end up doing other things: CS, engineering, industry,.. So what do I need to look( advice) before deciding to choose to continue (I might be ok at problem solving but in building theories, not everyone including me does it good or really wanted to do it)

(This is only optional question, you don't have to answer it all, but I want to hear your opinions, share you stories to everyone, I read Reddit a while and stories of people dropping out made me confused( I know everyone is different, they have the own reasons but I struggle too to do my ""right choice"".)

An idea about gravity.,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1502126023,True,"Recently I asked a question about how galaxies move apart due to the expansion of space. The evidence for this is redshift.

Another user gave an explanation using a grid on an inflating balloon as an analogy. That gave me the idea that matter and space are ultimately two manifestations of the same thing. My idea is that matter is just space that has been twisted/distorted or perhaps vibrating in various patterns. 

If so, this would explain why matter would follow along with expansion of the space around it.

But then I had a further idea. Suppose that matter and space are continuous with each other. Let's also suppose that space itself (like matter) is not perfectly elastic.

The result would be that a concentrated volume of matter would cause a geometric distortion of nearby space as that simple space (low density vacuum) reached a volume of high complexity (dense region of spatial distortion = matter). 

This sounds awfully similar to gravity doesn't it? I'd go so far to say that you could work out a formula to describe the constant for the ""elasticity"" of space itself would work out to be 1/r^2

Basically, matter does cause a warping of space. But think of it the way scrunching up part of a rubber sheet causes the nearby area of the sheet to stretch towards the area of folding.

Matter causes the effect of gravity because of the effect of it's complex spatial geometry on nearby space. The effects of gravity are expressed in space, over time.

Edit: This idea also gives you a whole new way of thinking about *inertia*. 

I'm open to replies/comments... even if everyone wants to trash this idea."

Mirror reflects light back to Sender and is half a distance away from sender, compared to reciever. Now we have entangled particles arriving to the sender & reciever at the same time. 
Sender depending on which information to send decides should he use quantum eraser or not.

_________________________________________________
   
   Light is known to act like a ""particle"" and a ""wave"" at the same time. 

   As shown in the double slit experiment many times, if you shoot out a single ""unobserved"" photon towards two ""cutout slits"" you can try to find out which slit the light photon will pass through. Surprisingly, the unobserved photon makes its way to the slits going through both of them at the same time. This is because the light particle acts like a ripple in a pond and bumps into itself as the photon makes it through both of the two slits at the same time. This causes the light pattern to have a wave-like interference pattern when it finally hits the ""back wall"" after it passes through the slits.
   The interesting part is when you do the ""simple task"" of OBSERVING THE PHOTON on which ""slit"" the photon goes through as you shoot it out. When this is done it only goes through one slit at a time and acts just as a particle not a wave.
***************
   At the point of observation something physical happens between the photon and the conscious observer. A change is made to the photon BECAUSE an observation from a conscious mind collapsed its wave function to a single point in spacetime therefore limiting it to pass through only one ""slit"" versus both at the same time. 
**********************************
   I do know that the wave function of a particle is seen to be a ""probability"" field of where that particle is most likely to be and as an observation occurs the probability function collapses into a specific point in space time.

   What I'm asking has more to do with the physical interaction between consciousness and the collapse of the wave function or what specifically is making the wave collapse. If you Subscribe to the scientific mindset, our knowledge of consciousness and observation is that our brain is just composed of a lot of neurons all firing in patterns with specific electrical oscillations which in turn give us the realization of consciousness or sense of self. While many say that consciousness is just an illusion created by evolution of the human brain and complex neural networks becoming more advanced, with time, I think there is proof of something deeper at play in the universe. Its fascinating to me that a mere observation of a light particle by the human brain can change its physical state of being.
*************************************
Question-
   When a light particle is in a wave like state why does it collapse into a particle once observed by our brains? What interactions are going on here between the two at the time of collapse? Also If you know anything on Light's role in Quantum Field Theory feel free to spread your wisdom. Also would like to know If there is a field for the photon just like there is a field for the other fundamental particles and what would this fields properties consist of.

Some questions about volts and mAh,1,2,False,False,False,Physics,1502287583,True,"Hi,
   I'm an SEO/Copywriting specialist for a promotional products company and we're undergoing a pretty big content overhaul at the moment. Consequently, I'm having to write a lot about topics I have very little knowledge of (hence my name of FabricQuestions - I had to learn a whole lot about sewing supplies last month.)

Anyway, I'm now working on a page about power banks and while I've been able to understand most of what I've read about them, but am still unclear on a few things. Hopefully someone here might be able to help me out a bit, as some of the sources I've looked at have either just not had any real answers or had ones that talked a bit over my head. 

1. If a power bank's battery has a capacity of 2200mAh and its input is 5V/550mA and its output is 5V/1000mA, how long could it last when trying to power up a phone requiring 2.1 amps?

2. I'm a little confused about alternating current and how to describe it in a simple way that an average business owner without a scientific background would understand. 

3. My next question would be given a power bank battery's capacity in mAh and knowing its input/output voltage and mA levels, are there any formulas I could generally apply to give information on how long it can last without a recharge based on the item it's charging? Basically it's the same as my first question, but I'm more looking for a general formula I could apply.

4. My final question relates to power banks with multiple ports. For example, one of our power banks has a battery with a capacity of 8000mAh. Both ports are at 5 Volts but one is 5V/1000mAh and the other is 5V/2100 mAh. How would I calculate how long the battery would hold up when both ports are in use?

Thank you very, very much for any help you can provide as I'm a bit over my head here having never taken a physics class in all my life."

Physics drives me crazy some times.,12,1,False,False,False,Physics,1502386044,True,"I can’t talk as intelligently as most of you can about Physics.  It’s simply an interest of mine.  I have no formal training or anything.  Most of what I know comes from my father when I was growing up and YouTube videos.


What I wanted to say is.  Some concepts of physics and being aware of our inability to grasp them is absolutely maddening at times.  It seems to me that observation, the way our minds tries to categories things and make sense of our surroundings is absolutely adequate for daily life as we know it.  But we are getting to the point where things like quantum physics, were two objects can seemingly affect each other instantaneously over enormous distances calls into question, does space exist at all or did we create space as a concept just as we created math as a way to try and explain things.  It’s starting to look more and more like we are 2 dimensional shadows starting to become aware of the wall we must be on and the breeze that’s must be cooling the wall with no way to access or study them.  


Now I’m hopeful. I realize in times past we thought the earth was flat, it was the center of the solar system etc. New discoveries are being made every day and I am hopeful that one day we will be able to understand the nature of gravity, time, space, the bizarre behavior of quantum particles and even the less likely, understand the obstacles in overcoming our own observation tools (I’m not talking about microscopes and telescopes I’m talking about the mental tricks we play on ourselves to make sense of what’s really happening.) But in the meantime it’s not the not yet understanding the universe that bothers me.  it’s the knowing that what I think is real…probably isn’t.  And if it isn’t how I can ever know what is.  It feels like it’s not the technology we lack, It’s our ability as human beings to observe the truth that really bothers me.


Does my mad rambling make any sense?

A question about a gravity experiment I'd like to do,103,0,False,False,False,Physics,1502408232,True,"I was thinking about Gravity last night and had a weird question.

Gravity falls off with the square of distance. But ""space/time"" is only one thing. If there is a ""spacial"" component to gravity (the radius between things), there also has to be a ""time"" component to gravity.

If I go into a gravitational field - I experience time dilation. 

If I move through SPACE it also creates time dilation , the faster I go toward C.

So, what if movement through space at a speed relative to a stationary object creates MORE gravity between us? 

For example:  if it's ""gravitons"" that produce gravity. Then if I start moving through space....in a circle...... the outside stationary world experiences more time than I do. That means more gravitons reach me per period.

Logically then I would feel MORE gravity from things while moving compared to them.

This would relate to dark energy today. The spiral arms of the galaxies are moving in circles relative to the center, so they will experience more gravity than we used to expect . . .

I need a satellite going fast enough with one of these on it? http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_fall2003.web.dir/Ryan_McAllister/Slide3.htm and see if the value differs from expected at that altitude?

I know I won't be an engineer, but from what I understand with a physics PhD I'll still have the skills that are desirable for certain positions with those companies.

How easy is the transition and how competitive is it for PhD grads to get into those type of industries? For NASA specifically I'm looking into their student internships they have for people in masters/PhD programs and that's something I'm definitely pursuing to get a job there later , along with similar positions at Argonne, Los Alamos etc.

Behringer ECM8000 Relative Frequency Response,2,6,False,False,False,Physics,1502579705,True,"This post is about the frequency response of a measurement microphone. Specifically for the Behringer ECM8000. I noticed something which i just had to share with someone.

Recently i tried doing some reading on how the frequency response calibration is done  for measurement microphones. My main interest for this is because i want to use them to calibrate sound systems. It's purely out of curiosity, since i'm wondering what the actual sound difference will be between a flat response system and one equalized by hearing.
It turned out that the process of creating an individual calibration, without already owning a calibrated microphone would be hard. So i tried receiving more information from the manufacturer, Music Group. They pointed me towards the manual. Luckily they also send me a calibration file, generalized from their manufacturing process. After plotting it with python i was amazed by the difference it showed compared to the manual. The link to the plot has been posted at the bottom of this post. 
The black plot at the bottom is their actual plot which i copied from the manual. The other two are plotted using the data which they send me. The reason i am posting this is because the difference between the plot they have in their manual and the data they provided me with is enormous. Their plot which is used for product advertisement shows an almost flat response. This is a result of how they have chosen to plot the data. But still then some points are off. How often does this happen with hardware? Obviously you would need to get individual hardware calibrated before doing precise measurements. But this example seems truly odd to me. 

TLDR: The manufacturer of this measurement microphone provided me with a calibration file which they have from their production process. It differs a lot from the plot which they have in their manual. How often are plots actually used to make something look better than it is? The plot is listed below. The red plots are their actual data. First one is a standard matplot plot, middle one has a similar layout as they use to advertise. The black plot is copied from their actual manual.

Anxiety beginning my first year as a Physics major?,18,28,False,False,False,Physics,1502594828,True,"I absolutely love physics.

I had decent grades in high school, excelled in every math and science topic, but people really close to me have talked behind my back about how they think I will flunk out and won't be able to handle the transition to college life.  I felt like it was reasonable that the transition would be tough and decided not to go above the 16 credit hours I'm registered for, but hearing all of my coworkers talk shit about me and even my older sister, who I looked up to as a child (she got a masters from Stanford in engineering), talked with my mom about how they think I'll flunk out.  It was surprising to hear this and it's really made me doubt myself and my abilities as university approaches ever slowly.  Next week is move-in weekend, and I'm worried that my mind will be fighting against me as I start this new semester.  Does anyone have any tips to help me focus on, well, not flunking out?

How do we justify the postulates of QM?,12,43,False,False,False,Physics,1502705393,True,"I'm reading Schumacher and Westmoreland's *Quantum Processes, Systems, and Information* in preparation for a QM course (using Griffiths), and it is not quite clear to me exactly what the status of the postulates of quantum mechanics are. That is, how much justification we have for each of them, how much that counts as a ""derivation"" of them, and what the problems with that approach are.

S&W do not take an axiomatic approach, but I have some idea of the postulates from e.g. Shankar, and it seems to me that S&W justify most of them rather satisfactory. Let me summarise some of it:

- **The probabilistic interpretation:** Applying the quantisation of light to the double slit experiment yields *P*(*x*) ∝ |*φ*(*x*)|^(2) quite readily, since the intensity of light at *x* is proportional to the number of photons at *x*.

- **States as vectors:** Consider e.g. a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (their example) through which we pass a single photon. Let the vector (1, 0) describe the state where the photon is located in the upper beam, and similarly for (0, 1) and the lower beam. They (I think) naturally extend this to spin states and higher-dimensional spaces.

- **The principle of superposition:** Comes directly from the double slit experiment. Thus any vector (*α*, *β*) = *α*(1, 0) + *β*(0, 1) is also a valid state, assuming |*α*|^(2) + |*β*|^(2) = 1 to maintain a total probability of 1. (I assume we must in fact postulate that it holds for any kind of state, also e.g. a spin state, since there isn't a classical analogue for which the principle does hold.)

- **Inner product:** Just the ordinary scalar product for now. The two vectors (1, 0) and (0, 1) thus span a two-dimensional inner product space of states, and they are an orthonormal basis for it.

- **Hilbert space:** They do not (yet, at least) elaborate on why we need the inner product space to be complete, stating that they ""will not have much to say about metric completeness"". It follows directly for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and they just assume it for infinite-dimensional spaces.

    But the states of the system are described by abstract vectors, for which the above column vectors are representations in a particular basis. Since the basis is orthonormal, the inner product is equal to the scalar product of the above representations.

- **Observables:** Each basis state is associated with a particular outcome of a measurement (e.g. photon in upper or lower beam). They define an observable to be a basic measurement in which each outcome is associated with a numerical value.

- **Operators:** With each observable we can associate an operator. They define this as the operator which has each of the basis vectors as eigenvectors, where the corresponding eigenvalues are the outcomes of each measurement. (The operator is uniquely defined since it is defined on a basis.) Thus the operator is orthonormal diagonalisable, and since its eigenvalues must be real, it follows that it is Hermitian (or self-adjoint, I suppose).

    Conversely, any Hermitian operator has an orthonormal eigenbasis and real eigenvalues, so it must describe an observable.

- **The Schrödinger equation**: Unitary time evolution is necessary to preserve normalisation, and the general Schrödinger equation follows from that. (Definition: An operator *U* is unitary if *U*^(†)*U* = *UU*^(†) = 1. They show that *U*^(†)*U* = 1 is necessary, but *U*^(†)*U* = *UU*^(†) is only a tautology in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and they will just assume unitary for infinite-dimensional spaces.)

This is, of course, just a summary. But they seem to do things almost opposite to Shankar, not postulating anything but defining terms along the way and arguing for each of the above conclusions.

Since this is not how it seems canonically to be done, I suppose it must not be adequate. But I'm unclear about exactly why. How much of it relies on classical physics, which I understand we cannot exactly use to justify QM, since it is in some sense ""incorrect"" or at least only an approximation. And how much of it is useful assumptions that turn out to work experimentally but are not adequately justified otherwise.

Also, I know this belongs in the weekly thread, but now that we're on the subject: If any of you have any books or other resources that concern this, I would also greatly appreciate that."

Stuck between my passion and a necessity of life,47,60,False,False,False,Physics,1502783276,True,"Hello my lovely reddit physicists,
I am currently an undergrad for BSc (Honors) Physics. It's my second year and I have one more year to go. Lately, two things have been eating me alive. That something is money. I have come to a realization that money is quite important in this world. I am 22 and my dad has taken student loans to pay for my college. As a son, it bothers me seeing my parents sacrificing for me so much. Therefore, I want to immediately get a good (not boring) job and help my parents out. But I feel this will put me in the system in which I can't get out of. I will be stuck and all my dreams and ideas will remain in my mind permanently. 

This brings me to the second thing that's been bothering me. It's my love for Physics. Ever since the first time I glazed my upon it a few years ago, I have fallen deeply in love with it. I know Physics is my calling and I can feel it in my blood. I would love to do research, especially in the black hole physics department. I have too many ideas whether they are right or wrong, I think it will help not only me but the people who pursue physics in the future. In order to do this, I have to go the Ph.D. route. I believe Ph.Ds do not pay well and is only sufficient for survival. I am fine with surviving, but my parent's burdens are also weighing over my shoulders. 

What should I do? Anyone ever been in such a position? Time flies by too fast, I do not want to be sitting on my graduation day clueless.

Some Background Info: I was majoring in Electrical Engineering and switched because of my love for physics. I went to a 2 year CC which made it three because I couldn't afford to pay for summer classes. I then transferred to a 4-year uni and studied there for one year. I had to suddenly leave America and my studies because my dad couldn't afford it anymore, as well as he got diagnosed with a couple of diseases and most of the money started going towards him.

Can the radius of a black hole go negative?,21,19,False,False,False,Physics,1502793213,True,"I was modelling a rocket around a planet using spherical coordinates and I hadn't constrained the surface so the rocket could just keep falling, so in effect the model was something akin to a black hole.

So anyway an odd thing happened as the rocket in free fall approached the centre of the planet (I didn't constrain the surface), the radius just continued on through and started to go negative as if the rocket went through the centre.

Now in a normal sense, there should be no such thing as a negative radius, but I paused because a black hole is so counter intuitive. 

Is there any merit to an interpretation than an object falling into a black hole has entered into a domain of negative radius in terms of spherical coordinate systems?"
Force between two charged conductors,11,18,False,False,False,Physics,1502798447,True,"Hi, I'm asking myself a very simple question but I can't match two ways of answering it, I'll put some context below for those interested.

So I have two parallels metallic electrodes connected to a voltage generator [like here](http://imgur.com/0AQ3Cav) and I'm interested by the force between them :

* They are connected together to a potential, they have the same charge, so each charge experiences the coulomb force and the net result would be that the electrodes repeal each other.

* They have the same potential, so the gradient is zero hence the electric field is zero, so no force at all.

What is wrong with my first point ? How could I get them to repeal ?

The detectors I'm working on are [Micromegas detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroMegas_detector) which is basically parallel plates in noble gas connected to high voltage (hundreds of volts). When a particle pass through the gap, it ionizes the gas and the electric field separate the electrons from the ions in the gas, the strong electric field of the Micromegas then accelerate the electron to create a sizeable signal. When the detectors are opened you can see the electrostatic pressure pulling one electrode toward the other, however I've always wonder if it's possible to get them to repeal and that's where I've got quite lost.

Entering 3rd year of college as a declared Physics major; goals for the future,8,3,False,False,False,Physics,1502851017,True,"Hello all. I am a student at a premier liberal arts state-school, and I declared my major as a Bachelor of Arts in Physics at the end of last spring. I believe I am starting to be able to more clearly see what it is I want to achieve.
I want to go into a technical/engineering field that relates to energy, systems, and sustainable architecture that will advance civilization towards a more sustainable future. (Masdar & NASA are my locations for a career.) In hindsight, I believe I should have been a Materials Science & Engineering major, but it's too late now.

My plan is take take as many physics and relating engineering classes as I can, for I am way to behind to be able to graduate with a B.S. in Physics in 4 years. This semester I am taking Modern Physics, Widely Applied Physics, and Intro to Engineering & Science of Materials. I feel like I am at a disadvantage, not only because I am pursuing a B.A. (which I've been told is much inferior to the B.S.), but also because I have struggled in my first two years with my Science & Math classes, receiving many C's due to my poor priorities & study habits.
My goals for the year is to get involved in the National Society of Black Engineers, achieve in my classes, and network/get involved in many other STEM/Sustainability organizations so hopefully next Summer I can get a decent internship somewhere like NASA or another organization, getting decent intern or research experience. I am really starting to fantasize about the idea of studying Materials Science or Energy Engineering in graduate school.
Are my goals feasible, or even realistic? And am I going about them right?"

"Which of the following do you think is more marketable? A major in Physics and a 4.0 GPA, or a major in Physics, two minors in CS and Math, and a 3.3 GPA?",9,4,False,False,False,Physics,1502858569,True,"What about the above mentioned, but instead of a 3.3 GPA, a 3.0 GPA?


EDIT:
To provide more background information for a more helpful answer, here's a little bit about what I want to do.  
Right now I am only just beginning a BS in Physics, and being a Research Physicist and pushing the limits of our knowledge of the universe interests me, but that would obviously be a huge commitment.  Additionally, I hear a lot about how physics majors have a very tough time with getting jobs (although, if I turn out to not be good at physics, I wouldn't mind being a HS Physics teacher, which might be an easier job to get).  I'm generally just interested in the whole field of Physics right now.   It looks like there are great job opportunities for Optics and Condensed Matter Physics, so I wouldn't mind going that route because that sounds interesting, but I'm also very interested in Cosmology, Quantum Field Theory, Particle Physics, String Theory, and especially theoretical physics as a whole.

I will at least minor in mathematical sciences, just because the classes I'm interested in later down that road just so happen to be enough to get me that (Algebra I and II, Topics in Geometry, and Topology, as well as many other classes not required, such as a couple proof-based math classes).  I didn't include that math minor in scenario #1 up in the title because I thought a minor in math wouldn't really mean anything to an employer when presented alongside a major in physics.

I want the experience in programming so I can be more marketable to employers in the future, which is why I'm considering a minor in CS too.  It would be tough to fit in my schedule though.  I would have to take a couple classes over the summer, and opt out of the possibility of eventually taking Advanced Calculus I and II.  I heard that Advanced Calculus I and II don't help very much with Physics, or at least the side of Physics that I'm interested in.


So yeah, as ambitious and naive as it sounds, my goal as a Physics major would be to get as close to a 4.0 GPA as possible, but with not one but two minors I can imagine that being a little more difficult, so scenario #2 I have a more humble goal of a 3.3 GPA set in mind."

Is it possible to find the distance an object will travel before it enters free fall?,13,3,False,False,False,Physics,1502892462,True,"Sorry if this is not the right subreddit, but the closest I ound was homework, and this isn't the case.

I'm working on a small project where I want to calculate the vertical distance travelled by a falling object, based on the time it takes to reach the ground. However, I believe I can't use the time alone, since until free fall, the speed is increasing. So I thought of two ways to achieve this: 

1 - I assume that this distance is irrelevant and ignore it. Not very likely because I want some precision here.

2 - I calculate the distance and time until free fall and then use the speed and time to calculate the distance. 

However, I have searched for how to calculate this distance and found nothing. Perhaps I haven't searched the correct terms and hence why I'm seeking for help here. 
 Meanwhile, a third scenario popped up in my head: what if the object never reaches free fall? This is also I have to work around.

Let's assume I'm using a tennis ball, falling vertically from a height of 3 meters, maximum, which scenario seems more likely? How can I calculate that distance and time?

Quantum induced crisis of a bachelor student.,22,14,False,False,False,Physics,1502909630,True,"Don't worry, this isn't some talk about how my view of the universe is shaken up after learning about quantum mechanics leading to a profound insight about how we're all interconnected. This is a bit more of a boring and personal crisis.


I've finished the second year of my bachelor's degree (which is three years in total in my country), or at least I passed most of my classes. Everything was going well. The courses get more challenging as further in you get, but they're still fascinating and engaging. I substituted some of the heavier math courses because proving theorems and such was never really anything that was intuitive to me. This was fine by me since it gave me more time to do research projects and other physics courses.


At the end of my second year, it was time for quantum physics and boy did it feel like running into a wall. The intuition I felt like I could build during the other courses was just gone. All I see is math. Somewhere in between wave functions, operators, bras, kets, perturbations and variations they lost me. If the question it self just doesn't seem real to me it get's really hard to focus on what is going on. Maybe that's just the way quantum mechanics are. I knew that my intuition would fail at some point, but I kept telling myself that there would be an opportunity to build a new one. All I found though was abstract math...


I don't really know what to do... If this is just a low point I have to work through, or if I'm just not cut out for modern physics... If anyone has found themselves in a similar situation or has any advice I'd gladly listen.


So, what do you guys think? Does my potential allow for states in which I graduate with a degree in physics, and what is the likelihood that I find myself in such a state once a measurement is made?

"General Relativity, Velocity, and time?",3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1502911156,True,"First and foremost let me say that I'm asking a question, not making assertions. What is in here is things that are what would seem to be, and I'm trying to see how relativity transforms these things that are intuitive and makes sense of them.

Okay, so I have a question. The mathematical description of velocity is ( V = D/T ). But when you travel at relativistic speeds things get a little bit weird. When the person in the space vessel is traveling they experience one length of time. But to the observer on Earth the time the journey takes seems longer compared to the time experienced by the person in the space vessel. With this being said, the apparent velocity is ( V = D/t' ) to a society with no knowledge of relativity and time dilation. With this velocity measured from earth we would imagine the space vessel moving very slow when this is clearly not the case. Another thing that this seems to imply is that when traveling at these relativistic speeds the distance between two objects increases which I infer by the the necessity for D to be larger to make the Velocity as measured from earth equal the true velocity.

So how is this accounted for in relativity? Feel free to use high level terminology and what not, also any sources that would help understand this would be great."
"If its possible for every particle in a machine (max clique by gravity) to simultaneously lower its energy locally, but knowing which direction would require info moves faster than light, will the machine fall into lower energy?",0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1502911172,True,"Here's the machine whose many dimensional energy gradient is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem (which is the subject of a $million millenium prize, about how efficiently such cliques can be found of all exponential combinations):

N equal weights, each hanging from 1 or more very lightweight strings. Between some pairs of weights, a very lightweight pole with an axle in its center pulls one up as far as the other goes down, or both can be pulled up by other strings. All weights start at the same height, with tension on all strings equally.

A weight's height is maximum of the strings it hangs from. A set of weights can all go down together if theres no string-pole-string between any of them. A max clique is the lowest energy if that max clique is more than half the weights.

This machine therefore stays in any npcomplete solution if those set of weights are pushed down simultaneously, but to push them down simultaneously, the pushes cant affect eachother until lightspeed can reach eachother, and slower than that through the longer path of string-pole-string.

Since everything is vibrating a little from brownian motion etc, its possible for a max clique of weights to happen to all be moving down at once, even though they had no way to know what the other weights were doing at the time.

If there are 99 weights, and a max of 50 of them can go down together, then 50 down pushes 49 up, and each string-pole-string has same center of gravity.

I understand an object will not climb a hill to get to a lower valley on the other side, but thats not instant. This is instant. This is a machine that could actually be built, though hard to adjust it so precisely.

My question is, since it could happen by accident to instantly fall toward a lower energy state everywhere, will gravity cause it to do that?"
Does my idea of archers swinging through the air around a tower using a rope and harness while firing arrows make sense?,11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1502911928,True,"As you probably gleaned, I'm a fantasy author and came up with a rather imaginative way for a society of people to use its elite warrior class. The town has many tall towers that widen at their tops and then have a wooden ramp that extend upwards of twenty feet out over the courtyard below. They use these towers to ambush invaders. Several dozen archers wait atop the tower, a rope (one end fastened and wrapped around the tower near its top, the other to a harness the archers wear) their means by which to swing around the tower and fire arrows at enemies as they descend in a wide arc that lowers them to ground at a safe speed.

In my head, it makes sense and I believe it is possible. The only issue I see is them not maintaining enough momentum away from the tower, which would result in them slamming into the side of it. Let's say that the tower is 100 ft tall. The rope is cut at a perfect distance that they would be just inches from the ground when they reach it, ensuring that they don't damage their legs. I'll provide the actual text from the novel in progress (which hasn't yet gone to my editor so be nice about grammar and flow issues, please), although it certainly isn't necessary to be read to understand my question, but may provide better insight into the process.

""The pounding of feet sounded from above and one of the lines of rope began to move toward the wooden ramp. The men creeping through the courtyard below broke into a wild dash. Their malnourished frames moved like shadows across the ground, sliding around each other as though through one another. 

A man suddenly took the skies, leaping from the platform out into the empty air. In his hands he gripped a bow and nocked arrow. A harness wrapped his frame, circling his armpits, chest, and upper thighs. The rope suddenly went taut and he swung around the tower in a swift arc, carried far away from the base of the tower by the momentum of his jump. 

(break in text)

The first archer reached the end of his rope and his feet hit the ground in a sprint. He popped open the hook connecting the rope to his harness and threw it off. He slowed his charge and spun around, his bow in one hand and a curved, thick, short blade in the other.""

Could some quantities of physics be better understood just by looking the units behind them?,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1503068830,True,"I'm just going to start off with the formula for (max) static friction: μ_k * N = μ_k * P * A

Now P and A when multiplied together is just the normal force, which got me thinking. Does multiplying units kind of ""combines"" them in some sense? 

Like: static friction between two objects depends on how much PRESSURE is distributed between a certain AREA. (Sorry if this is incorrect, it's my rough definition) So the final product would be combining these two quantities which is just the normal force.

Now later on when I learned work and energy, the units for work is N-m. Which kind of makes sense for me for 2 reasons...


1. Acceleration doesn't imply displacement. I would punch a building and it won't budge.

2. Displacement doesn't imply acceleration. A mass with constant non-zero velocity has no acceleration.

Something with an optical density (OD) of 5 or more is ok for direct observation of the sun. Let's convert Shade (S) 14. 

OD=0.428*(S-1) 

OD=0.428*(14-1) 

OD=5.564 

That checks out. 

What if we use a shade 10 and a shade 5 layered together.... 

OD=0.428*(10-1)=3.852 
OD=0.428*(5-1)= 1.712 

3.852+1.712=5.564 

So, layering a shade 5 and a shade 10 should offer the same protection as a shade 14. If this looks wrong to any of the way smart folks, let me know. I appreciate the help! Happy viewing everyone!"

"Interesting passage in Feynman's book on him giving his first seminar in front of Wolfgang Pauli, John von Neumann, and Albert Einstein",21,314,False,False,False,Physics,1503261837,True,"Wheeler said, ""Feynman, you're a young fella--
you should give a seminar on this. You need experience in giving talks. Meanwhile, I'll work out
the quantum theory part and give a seminar on that later.""
So it was to be my first technical talk, and Wheeler made arrangements with Eugene Wigner to
put it on the regular seminar schedule.



A day or two before the talk I saw Wigner in the hail. ""Feynman,"" he said, ""I think that work
you're doing with Wheeler is very interesting, so I've invited Russell to the seminar."" Henry Norris
Russell, the famous, great astronomer of the day, was coming to the lecture! Wigner went on. ""I think Professor von Neumann would also he interested."" Johnny von Neumann was the greatest mathematician around. ""And Professor Pauli is visiting from Switzerland, it so happens, so I've invited Professor Pauli to come""--Pauli was a very famous
physicist--and by this time, I'm turning yellow. Finally, Wigner said, ""Professor Einstein only
rarely comes to our weekly seminars, but your work is so interesting that I've invited him specially,
so he's coming, too."" By this time I must have turned green, because Wigner said, ""No, no! Don't worry! I'll just warn
you, though: If Professor Russell falls asleep--and he will undoubtedly fall asleep--it doesn't mean
that the seminar is bad; he falls asleep in all the seminars. On the other hand, if Professor Pauli is
nodding all the time, and seems to be in agreement as the seminar goes along, pay no attention.
Professor Pauli has palsy.""




I went back to Wheeler and named all the big, famous people who were coming to the talk he
got me to give, and told him I was uneasy about it.
""It's all right,"" he said. ""Don't worry. I'll answer all the questions.""
So I prepared the talk, and when the day came, I went in and did something that young men who
have had no experience in giving talks often do--I put too many equations up on the blackboard.
You see, a young fella doesn't know how to say, ""Of course, that varies inversely, and this goes this
way . . . because everybody listening already knows; they can see it. But he doesn't know. He can
only make it come out by actually doing the algebra--and therefore the reams of equations.
As I was writing these equations all over the blackboard ahead of time, Einstein came in and
said pleasantly, ""Hello, I'm coming to your seminar. But first, where is the tea?""
I told him, and continued writing the equations.




Then the time came to give the talk, and here are these monster minds in front of me, waiting!
My first technical talk--and I have this audience! I mean they would put me through the wringer! I
remember very clearly seeing my hands shaking as they were pulling out my notes from a brown
envelope. But then a miracle occurred, as it has occurred again and again in my life, and it's very lucky for
me: the moment I start to think about the physics, and have to concentrate on what I'm explaining,
nothing else occupies my mind--I'm completely immune to being nervous. So after I started to go, I
just didn't know who was in the room. I was only explaining this idea, that's all.




But then the end of the seminar came, and it was time for questions. First off, Pauli, who was
sitting next to Einstein, gets up and says, ""I do not sink dis teory can be right, because of dis, and
dis, and dis,"" and he turns to Einstein and says, ""Don't you agree, Professor Einstein?"" 
Einstein says, ""Nooooooooooooo,"" a nice, Germansounding ""No, ""--very polite. ""I find only that
it would be very difficult to make a corresponding theory for gravitational interaction."" He meant
for the general theory of relativity, which was his baby. He continued: ""Since we have at this time
not a great deal of experimental evidence, I am not absolutely sure of the correct gravitational
theory."" Einstein appreciated that things might he different from what his theory stated; he was very
tolerant of other ideas.




I wish I had remembered what Pauli said, because I discovered years later that the theory was
not satisfactory when it came to making the quantum theory. It's possible that that great man
noticed the difficulty immediately and explained it to me in the question, hut I was so relieved at
not having to answer the questions that I didn't really listen to them carefully. I do remember
walking up the steps of Palmer Library with Pauli, who said to me, ""What is Wheeler going to say
about the quantum theory when he gives his talk?"" 
I said, ""I don't know. He hasn't told me. He's working it out himself.""
""Oh?"" he said. ""The man works and doesn't tell his assistant what he's doing 'on the quantum
theory?"" He came closer to me and said in a low, secretive voice, ""Wheeler will never give that
seminar.""




And it's true. Wheeler didn't give the seminar. He thought it would he easy to work out the
quantum part; he thought he had it, almost. But he didn't. And by the time the seminar came around,
he realized he didn't know how to do it, and therefore didn't have anything to say.
I never solved it, either--a quantum theory of half-advanced, half-retarded potentials--and I
worked on it for years."

How important is recognising the imaginary dimensions of a wavefunction when it comes to electron tunneling?,15,3,False,False,False,Physics,1503328964,True,"Hey all,


A bit of context - I'm entering my last year of school (upper sixth in the UK) and haven't been formally taught anything about complex or imaginary numbers - however I have done some research on them.


The dillema I'm having arises from a project I'm doing on quantum computing, specifically about how electron tunneling works.

I've taken a ""solved"" version of Schrödinger's equation (ie an equation in the form 


f(X) = Ae^[-(rad[2m(v-e)/h^2 ^])X]


When taking the particle on the same side of the wall, the potential (V) energy of the particle is zero, giving a negative value inside the radical - resulting in an exponential with a complex number.


I've been shown how this can be transformed into a cos(X) + isin(X) format which is really helpful to find out a probability function if I just use the cos(X) component (by finding the function modulus and squaring)


Just transforming the cos(X) gives a pretty solution, however the second imaginary component has been completely ignored.

If I'm modelling this not to find experimental data, but just as an example on the maths behind quantum tunneling in a basic two dimensional example, can I just ignore the imaginary component?


Many thanks, sorry if I've waffled a little bit in my explaination!"

Linearizing equations in perturbation theory,3,2,False,False,False,Physics,1503346093,True,"I'm reading _Cosmological Perturbations and Inflationary Theory_ from Gorbunov &amp; Rubakov and right in the very first chapter there are expressions I just can't derive myself.  Given are three equations, the poisson equation for gravity as well as the hydrodynamic equations

[; \Delta \phi = 4 \pi G \rho;]

[; \dot{\rho} + \nabla (\rho \vec{v}) = 0 ;]

[; \rho\dot\{\vec{v}} + (\rho \vec{v} \nabla) \cdot \vec{v} = -\nabla p - \rho \nabla \phi ;]


It is then assumed ""that in the abscence of perturbations, the fluid is homogenous and static and that the Newtonian potential vanishes"", i.e.

[; \rho = const, p = const, \vec{v} = 0, \phi = 0 ;] .

They then introduce small perturbations [; \delta \rho , \delta p, \delta \vec{v} = \vec{v}, \delta \phi = \phi ;] and obtain the linearized equations

[; \Delta \phi = 4 \pi G \delta \rho ;]

[; \frac{\partial \delta \rho}{\partial t} + \rho \nabla \cdot \vec{v} = 0 ;]

[; \frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t} = - \frac{\nabla \delta p}{\rho} - \nabla \phi;]


Those three linearized equations are the ones I have a problem with. I assume there's a technique used I have never seen before and that's why I can't figure out the logic needed to do the necessary steps. I've tried several methods that are used to linearize equations (for example [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1514184/how-to-get-this-variational-equation-and-this-linearization)), but I just can't get this result.

I spent today collecting data on the solar eclipse from within the umbra with some of my colleagues. I'd like to share some prelimary findings.

I don't know if any of this is at all interesting or useful, but it can't hurt to share.

1. Our shadow bands were going westward. Before totality: about 5° south of west. After totality: about 5° north of west.
2. From a few moments before to a few moments after totality our N/S air speed dropped to zero (I can't recall right now if it had been going North or South before and after this drop.

3. We noticed a sort of double imagery with the eclipse a few minutes before totality. We were too distracted to check again for it after totality. We don't know if this was caused by our lenses, the atmosphere, the moon, or the sun.

4. We haven't yet analyzed our telescopic findings, air pressure data, temperature data, humidity data, or UV data."

Hawking radiation and crossing the event horizon of a black hole,5,3,False,False,False,Physics,1503355367,True,"I am not a physicist; I have never taken a rigorous physics course (my astronomy course had no math). I'm a PhD student in mathematics, though, so I'm comfortable with it.

I have heard of Hawking radiation and that it leads to black holes eventually ""evaporating"" away. This makes me question whether any object can cross the event horizon of a black hole.

My understanding of the event horizon of a black hole is that as an object approaches the event horizon, time seen from that object accelerates to the point that when they cross the event horizon they've reached the end of time (wtf?), and once they cross they can never escape. But if the decay of the black hole is an event in time, wouldn't the black hole evaporate before the object had the opportunity to cross the event horizon? In that case, nothing ever crosses the event horizon.

This is just a question that has nagged at me, and I'd like to hear an answer."

Microwave Heating Core Before Exterior,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1503423953,True,"Hello, 

I have a physics question which I do not understand and I'm hoping someone can explain. 

I have some emperical data that shows a large block of butter heating from the inside out which to me defies physics. The block is 9x11x16 inches in dimension. We are applying 5 kW of 915 mHz microwave energy for 2-5 minutes. We are then probing the large cube of butter and we are finding the core is heating faster than the edges. 
We are trying to heat the block from 0 F to 55 F. At the end of our runs we are seeing the core ~20 F warmer then the edges. 
In my mind the waves reaching the center of the block should have less energy than the waves passing through the exterior. 
By the end of the test the core was ~20 F warmer than the edges. I understand microwaves heat volumetrically so the entire volume should be heating but the edge, heating slightly faster, but the edge would also be cooling slightly because it has the most conduction with the surrounding air. 

Any insight would be great! "

Is it necessary to knock-in a new cricket bat?,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1503517582,True,"I've just had a long conversation with a man who makes bats for a living, and he said that I didn't need to knock in my new bat (that he'd just hand-made for me), just take it to nets and play against old balls for a bit until I'd got the feel of it.

Other people have told me over the years that it's crucial to spend hours knocking in bats, and given me long lists of instructions about how exactly to do it.

Some people say it will make the bat play better, some people say it will make it last longer.

One can hear all sorts of strong opinions about this sort of thing, but is there any actual science on it? Or arguments that make it obvious one way or another?

I've tried knocking in carefully for hours, knocking in by netting, and not doing anything at all before going and playing against a new ball. I've bought cheap bats and pricey bats. I've never really noticed it making any difference, and my bats always break after about a year (maybe 40 games and some nets).

The only exception was my 21st birthday bat (a Gray-Nicholls five star), which never seemed to age at all, and which I used for ten years before it became obvious that it had gone completely dead.

Ideally I would go back for higher education in something like computer simulations of physics related problems, like orbits and trajectory analysis and stuff. I am wondering what is my best combination of things. I would like to stay out of the double major idea as currently I wouldn't like it. The combinations currently are: Physics major, comp sci minor. Comp sci major, physics minor. Double major (as I said, least likely). I will also have an astro minor on top of that mostly regardless, I am coming in with a lot of credit and the astro minor goes with the physics idea well. 
To restate: my ideal path is Bachelors --&gt; comp sci job (unless physics major allows me a combo of comp sci and physics job) --&gt; going back for masters and PhD if want/need, potentially paid for through a company. Thank you for any expertise.  "

How does uncertainty principles work in Bohmian Mechanics?,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1503558722,True,"Hi! I have a basic question about Bohmian Mechanics.

In most interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, the particle IS the wave function. Which naturally implies that something like position and momentum can't be measured at the same time. (We're measuring a wave, not a classical point particle.)

In my rudimentary understanding of Bohmian Mechanics, there is actually a point particle, but it's guided by a wave (the wave function). That should imply that there does exists a definite position, and a definite momentum, simultaneously at all times. In this description, why are we unable to measure those quantities?

And a follow-up question, if you're in a mood for typing: How is the energy-time uncertainty principle explained in Bohmian mechanics? "

If i take a closed vessel filled with 95% water and 5% air/water vapor above it, then raise the temperature, how will the pressure change?

I'm a junior undergrad who changed majors (from audio engineering) to study engineering physics a semester ago, and now I am doubting my decisions. I believe that I can do the coursework it's just that I can't see where this is taking me. I do not see myself getting a job in a physics related field (however I can see myself in an audio position). Is there anyone out there who can connect me with potential employers to see where this path may take me. I am not asking for an internship or anything I simply wish to be able to speak to someone and see what it is I'm getting into and if it is truly my passion. Yes, I've asked my professors, and advisors countless times, where this will get me and they always point me towards grad schools. However, I am unsure if that is where I want to go. Also, I'm just curious, if I continue with physics will it be possible to get a job in audio if I'm already doing audio on the side to get experience?

The goal of this is to get a dynamic, electric-shock effect (I'm trying to simulate a van de graaff generator without the terrible danger) I'll also only need to be able to intermittently switch it on (zap it instead of leave it running) so I don't think overheating the electrodes will be a problem.
Additionally, the specifics of the color are pretty unimportant as well, so the cheapest or easiest gas to work with will be the best thing to fill the tube with.

The Physics of *Star Wars: Rogue One: Impossible Space Battle Scene Discussion:,12,0,False,False,False,Physics,1503682428,True,"To get it out of the way, yes *Star Wars* is a fictional universe that includes lots of physically impossible things (light sabers, Death Star lasers that change direction at a point in space, etc.) 

So this is about the physics involved in a small ship (a Hammerhead Corvette) moving a Star Destroyer as done in the movie, which forces it to collide into *another* Star Destroyer that is pretty much cut in half. Here's the scene in question: https://youtu.be/sbfr6k7R9zQ

[Here's a Wired article about the physics involved](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/rogue-one-hammerhead-star-destroyer/). They conclude that to even move a Star Destroyer like that, the Hammerhead Corvette would need something like 6,000 times the thrust of a Saturn V rocket. And if that was the case, then they should've been using these Hammerhead Corvettes way more often in space battles.

The big issue is the ability to push a Star Destroyer into another one with enough force to pretty much cut it *in half*. There's no way this is possible. What should've happened was the second Star Destroyer gets bumped to go in the other direction. Unless it was moving towards the first Star Destroyer at the same rate of speed, which it clearly wasn't. 

Or am I wrong about the physics involved?"

Why not to use small diameter for wireless charging transmitter coil?,5,30,False,False,False,Physics,1503752440,True,"The issue with wireless charging is that you need to make contact, small distance, and you have to align it perfectly to work.
We cannot change the receiver coil as it is very limited in space, and I don't see why transmitter coil should match the receiver.
So if we make the transmitter coil diameter smaller, (compensate that with more turns), it should make more focused magnetic field, so we gain more distance as in the image:
http://imgur.com/LVqSh3c
which is done by online simulator: http://www.falstad.com/vector3dm/
And/or it allows for more nonalignment.
basically it is the same concept as bigger container collect flow scattering from longer distance.

Also, shouldn't the transmitter be more powerful? it is not portable, no need to keep it very light, and wireless charging is about easy use before efficiency, for most efficiency we use cable charging.

another point, when we add two coils next to each other, they support each other field in between which boost the distance of magnetic field!
so why not to use 4 or 5 smaller diameter coils?

Relativity of Simultaneity,14,4,False,False,False,Physics,1503793997,True,"I was reading part of a book about simultaneity which used an example to explain it. It is similar to the following:

A person (let's name him A) is on a train moving at .75c (or any other appreciable fraction of c) relative to a person on the ground (B). On this train there are firecrackers on each end and A is standing in the middle of them. Person B sees the train passing by and observes both firecrackers going off at the same time. He measures the distance he is from the burn marks they left and determines he was in the middle of the two firecrackers when they went off. Okay, makes sense. Now for person A. Person A sees the firecracker that is on the front of the train go off first and the one on the back go off last. The explanation I've seen for this is that person A is moving toward the light the firecracker on the front emitted, so it reaches him first, while he is moving away from the light the firecracker emitted on the back.

Distance measurements question in cosmology,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1503814120,True,"I was hoping someone could help me with this conceptual question about distance measurements in cosmology, primarily angular diameter distances. Now, I know that at low redshifts, the luminosity, angular, and comoving distances all recover the same formula. That makes sense as they should if describing the same physical object. What I am confused on is how is it possible that these distance measurements can disagree? For example, take a galaxy at some redshift that is emitting light. If I calculated the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance, I would receive two different answers for the same physical object at large enough redshift. Am I misinterpreting what these quantities actually represent? It seems most introductory cosmology texts just gloss over the fact that each distance measurement gives a different dependence on redshift and don't agree after some initial point. Why is this?"

Question on Nuclear Current,2,25,False,False,False,Physics,1503842158,True,"I've been reading about anapole moments, which are caused by nuclear currents. Nuclear currents come from the exchange of bosons, charged or uncharged. Feynman diagrams of the interaction show that a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and electron anti-neutrino, via a W- boson.

My question is how do you have any type of sustained nuclear current if the current comes from a decay process? If all of the neutrons are decaying into protons and electrons, then it seems like the atomic number is changing.

The anapole moment has been measured for Cesium, so I assume an atom isn't changing into something else to have an anapole moment.

What does QFT say about what exists?,44,16,False,False,False,Physics,1503857043,True,"You come across various existential statements in your quantum field theory texts, such as:

&gt; even matter itself is an excitation of a quantum field

and find that many authors seem to come short of attributing reality to, say, the physically meaningful quantities that remain invariant under gauge transforms. And it's usually ambiguous whether the objects of such theories are to be taken seriously only pragmatically, or if we're to understand them as constituting reality in some fundamental way. 

So, assuming that QFT describes what exists, what exists according to QFT? Are there any texts that explicitly go over this?"
Does Boltzmann's fluctuations happen in regard of all the four physicall forces?,10,3,False,False,False,Physics,1503861615,True,"Hello there =) 
First of all, I just studied the Physics career for 1 year, so I it may be that my question is totally nonsense. But please, if you can help, please answer in the most detailed way possible, I'm willing to do my research to understand your response to whatever it takes.
That being said, I have been looking at some of this lectures by Susskind (you don´t have to watch them, I'm just placing here my sources): 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7eW-xPEvoQ 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhnKBKZvb_U

Here, and some other people I have come across, states that the Boltzmann fluctuations (such as a broken bowl full of oats that has fallen comes together up to the table again, or the spontaneous generation of new galaxies, etc, watever be the case) can occur. For instance, about the oats bowl, it happens in regard of gravity?? D: 
I mean, does this random configuration of random molecules can fight the force of gravity and push upwards, say, a ball on the floor? Or does this means that given the simetry of the laws of physics, and applying them backwards in time, means that, say the force of gravity turns the direction of its vector the other way around?
We could imagine other processes like the combustion of paper. Or endotermic/exotermic chemical reactions. Could they happen, backwards in time, to a low enthropy state, in regards of the need of energy that needs them to happen?

I hope that I had been able to explain myself correctly. If not, let me know. I also know that this equations are mainly to describe the microscopic state. hmmmm, so maybe all this examples that I said, are simple analogies?

"Time ""freezes"" in the POV of an observer moving with the velocity c - how can it be affected by other objects?",21,1,False,False,False,Physics,1503879340,True,"I'm quite a newbie to ""relative"" physics, so please excuse me if this question seems obvious or stupid. Also I'm writing on my phone, so there will be one or another mistakes.

I red that for an observer moving at the speed of light time comes to a full stop (for the observer). Therefore I assume that this observer couldn't observe any changes in the outside world; is this correct?

Given that my previous assumption is true, how can outside objects interact with the observer (light)? For example, imagine a light particle being emitted by the sun. AFAIK there are no major gravity fields nearby, so it should travel in a straight line.
At the time of its emission there are no objects in this line, but during its travel another object with a velocity &lt; c moves in front of the observer. Because time stopped in the observers POV it shouldn't be aware of this object blocking the path.

Is this assumption correct (or rather, what is wrong about it)? I can more or less understand how two objects can have different timescales, but I can't wrap my head around the scale of 0.

Monitor outputs 1ms constant visual delay of which can only be effective if there is no delay from rendering frames above or below 75hz

If above 75fps (uncapped frames) there is chance for inconsistencies in visuals and movement however it can reduce input latency

If capped at 75fps constant there is no visual or movement inconsistencies and there will be a constant 13 millisecond input latency

What's a good mental model for what it means that the flow of time isn't constant in general relativity?,10,0,False,False,False,Physics,1503965497,True,"General relativity says that, as I move my finger around in my office, through Earth's gravity gradient, the ""flow"" of time at my finger tip is constantly changing (though by very small amounts, ~10^20 or so.)

What I haven't been able to understand is what does that change in flow mean when you try to understand time. In other words, the usual mental model is that time flows the same for everything in your office, say. But that's not correct! Time flows slower for things closer to the floor than to the ceiling (unless you have a really large mass hanging over your head...)

Another way to ask the question is: ok, suppose I have a small charged black hole floating in front of me. It's charged to hold it in place. Let's assume it's big enough that the Hawking radiation isn't enough to worry about. I stick my finger near it (but not too near.) The tide is bearable. I can pull my finger out if I want to. Now time is flowing slower at my fingertip. What happens? Can I feel the difference in time flow? Does my finger appear red-shifted?

I know it's a kind of fuzzy question, my apologies. While I can easily work out the math, it seems clear to me I still don't really understand what variable time flow MEANS.

I had a really important interview today and managed to completely embarrass myself on a Fermi problem.

I did better on the second Fermi problem-calmed down and tried to go slower-and got a decent answer, but I still didn't do as well as I hoped. I needed a little nudge from the interviewer.

I actually realized that-once you took away the massive level of nervousness I was undergoing at the time-that I found the Fermi problem kind of fun. More importantly, I don't ever want to screw up like that again. Part of this is simply improving my verbal communication skills, which have never been good, but part of this is getting better at these sorts of teasers, which is a nice way of testing my logic skills, too.

"From the point of view of an object falling into a black hole, shouldn't the black hole decay due to hawking radiation before another object fell in?",11,3,False,False,False,Physics,1504150557,True,"If object A crosses the event horizon, and then object B crosses shortly after, wouldn't it follow that the mass/energy contributed to the black hole by object A evaporates via hawking radiation before B actually crosses the event horizon from the perspective of A?

I'm extrapolating this from recently learning that an observer watching something go into a black hole would actually witness the thing freeze (but be technically unable to observe it because of the infinite red shift). If two things then go into the black hole one after the other, then it seems like this effect would still occur over arbitrarily short distances within the event horizon, meaning the first object would experience all of its time in the black hole before the second object ever even joined. 

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to sort this out for me. "

Since space is a vacuum there is no way for sound to travel since sound needs a medium to travel through. Can an escaped gas ""hold"" sound? Or is it that the gas will dissipate so quickly that he sound also dissipates and disappears?

Related to that, if you were touching a giant gong in space and someone hit it would you be able to feel it but not hear it?

[Electromagnetism] Magnet falling down aluminum pole perpendicular to pole?,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1504325528,True,"My professor just dropped a magnetic sphere through an aluminum pole and it went really slow because of faradays law, which makes sense and we've all seen this many times.

Immediately afterward she was able to drop the ball through the pole and have it fall at *normal speed*?!? I know she used the same pole, and same ball, but I'm not sure if she changed anything else.

&amp;nbsp;

I understand what causes the magnet to slow down when dropped through the pole. But now I am confused as to how she was able to get it to fall normally through the very same pole?

&amp;nbsp;

My initial theory is that if she places the sphere into the pole so that its magnetic field is perpendicular to the axis of the pole there should never be a flux change and thus the magnet will fall at normal speed. 

I'm guessing that the geometry of this situation is not that simple though; after all ive seen many times the professor just plops the ball into the tube and it works every time, and the ball is just a literal sphere and there probably isn't even any way to tell what is north and what is south.

In the academic article (https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-25-17-19795&amp;id=370470) it seemed like they were firing a laser through water and measuring the polarization of light at the other end.

I may have a hypothesis that explains dark energy and the creation of the universe.,13,0,False,False,False,Physics,1504345140,True,"So to start, I have a burning passion for physics(Only slightly exaggerated). I read papers whenever I can and love reading about new hypotheses put forward. The concepts come really easy to me, and I'm currently going to school to learn all the math behind them. But I periodically have some ideas that seem ""viable.""

My most recent one is probably my second craziest idea. It is basically that gravitational force can ""slip"" its way past the center of a black hole given the right conditions. What this would mean is that the direction of gravity would continue along past the center and instead of pulling space time towards it from all directions, it would then push space time away from it in all directions. This could be taken as the mechanism behind the expansion of the universe. Though I'm not sure what, if anything would happen to the black hole. Maybe spontaneous destruction of energy?

Now this adds another implication to a theory on one of the models of the universe. Specifically a model that says the universe is infinite and constantly expanding, and has ""pockets"" of universe pop into existence. The way I reached this conclusion is on one additional assumption along with two facts we know about our universe given the information available. Firstly, We know expansion can and does accelerate, even beyond the speed of light. Second, we know that our universe popped into existence with an expansion faster than light and that all the energy that created the matter we can see was created then as well. 

Now if we assume that if the expansion of areas of the universe accelerates to a point, spontaneous creation of energy occurs, this would indicate that our pocket of universe was created this way and many more just like it have occurred elsewhere in the infinite expanding universe.

Like I said, I am in school for the subject so I'm not entirely sure what the math would be to try and figure out if this is possible yet. Hell, this may be just too outlandish to be possible.

Thoughts and discussion are more than welcome.

-Is it beneficial to put some weight on your knee when cornering in a steady state, or does it decrease vertical load on the tires and cause you to lose grip?


-Is it possible to save the bike losing the front tire grip and about to fall, by applying a torque with your knee along the roll axis?

"Does anyone do research with experimental Cosmology, specifically with DESI and dark energy?",0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1504486275,True,"Hey guys I know this is a bit of a niche field and a narrow one, but I didn't know who to ask. 

I met an adviser who seems he's willing to take me in and he does research in cosmology. I have never done research in this before, and I am diving in head first. One of the projects he has is control systems and using python to properly program a lot of the software such as cameras, CCD detectors etc.

The other is analysis and his post doc does more of that. That's going to be more about the post doc having time to train me and willing to put in the time. 

Data Analysis is what I want to do and getting into the heart of the data. Previously I had 2-3 years in condensed matter research but my heart as always in astro and doing something with observational astro. 

Anyone have any experience in cosmology and doing things on the observational front? Observational astroparticle research is also something I'm looking into but after reading upon research cosmology seems to interest me a bit more and it feels like the path I want to go on."
Shower thought about density of states,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1504488391,True,"In my old quantum class we used the WKB approximation to calculate the time it would take for a PBR can to tip over due to thermal fluctuations. The tunneling probability is exponentially suppressed and goes (roughly) as e^(-barrier width*height). We of course got an extremely small number. 

In the calculation, though, we assume that there is only one way for the can to tip over. If we were being honest, we should've integrated over a density of states up to infinite energy to account for all possible ways it could tip. This of course wouldn't make much of a difference because DOS's are usually polynomial or sub-polynomial. 

However, if the DOS grew at a faster rate than the energetic suppression, then the beer's time-to-tip would go to zero. My question is if there are any systems where the DOS blows up, enabling us to see macroscopic quantum effects, and, if not, is there any fundamental reason why a system's DOS can't blow up beyond the observation we don't see weird stuff everyday? Does this line of thought place any useful bounds on new physics?"
Any ideas?,19,0,False,False,False,Physics,1504489620,True,"Hey people. Or not people. Or whatever.

Me and my friend enjoy doing physics and maths a lot, so what we decided to do was use important equations in physics, and take them to the next level.

We've already found how far you'd have to stretch your average rubber band from the earth's surface to cause an explosion with the force of a nuclear bomb. (It's really far. Like, *really* far.)

We've currently trying to find if we can run a city off of a black hole the size of a Proton Jumbuck (a really unsafe car.)

So yeah, any ideas for ridiculous equations to take to the next level? Anything at all is appreciated. Bonus points if you can somehow incorporate the Proton Jumbuck. It's a running theme.

We'll also probably turn this into a series on YouTube, because why not.

All of this made me think, what if time and gravity are the same thing. At the moment it made perfect sense to me and it's really hard to explain now but I mean if u think about it, if u were to increase the amount of gravity that just you were experiencing you would basically be time traveling relative to the rest of the world. I know that Time prolly doesn't equal gravity but it's just something to think about."

Question over wording in textbook,10,1,False,False,False,Physics,1504494186,True,"So I tried asking this question in Physics Stackexchange and got every response except the one that answerd my question :( 

Anyway, my question regards this statement i found in my physics textbook: ""no work is required to move a charge from one point to another on an equipotential line"" 

Do they mean work by the electric field or work by anything? Because clearly the object cant just magically move with nothing.

For example, if i place a positive charge in an electric field it clearly moves radially outwards. Now if we pause time (for a bit after it moves) and consider how to move that charge from one point in the equipotential line (that it is currently occupying) to another in the same line, we see that it would require moving the charge perpendiculat to its current position. Now how can this be done with no work? Clearly we need to change its momentum/path to be perpendicular and that would require some type of force and a distance right (and as a result some work is being done to the charge)? This leads me to infer that they meant the electric field when they said this, is that right?"

Career advice into environmental physics or geophysics,3,14,False,False,False,Physics,1504520309,True,"Some background:
I'm going into the 4th year of my MSci Physics degree at a well ranked uni in the UK. I've been abroad for my 3rd year in NZ so due to the seasons, I couldn't really find time to fit in any work experience/placements during my degree. 

I've done a little bit of geophysics(mainly atmosphere and oceans but a little bit of solid earth too) in NZ and I really enjoyed it however my university in the UK doesn't offer it. Because of this I'm taking mainly astrophysics modules this year and doing a research project on exoplanet atmospheres, which I think will be super interesting.

My goal is to work in some kind of environmental/sustainability job where I'm hopefully having a positive impact on the world, not really too concerned about money. Things that come to mind are solar, hydroelectric, geophysics or working for someone like Tesla on R&amp;D would be a dream too. Basically I don't know how to get into this industry. Would I have to do a conversion for a year to become an environmental engineer or would it be best to find a good company to do an internship(potentially unpaid) to learn the basic skills?

I find astrophysics really interesting too but I'm not sure if I would like to pursue a PHD and academia, would there be jobs in that field open to MSci graduates?

[Question] Regarding the Future of Interstellar Communication,15,6,False,False,False,Physics,1504533174,True,"Hey guys. As my flair suggests, I am not a physics student or professional. I'm simply an enthusiast so I appreciate any assistance you can provide. This is a fairly simple question so I'm hoping that my monkey brain will be able to understand the answer. Haha.

I was about to go into several paragraphs of exposition but honestly, given what subreddit I'm in, I don't think it's necessary so here's the question.

Since traditional communication methods would not functionally work at interstellar distances, are there any theoretical limits or constraints to using quantum entanglement to communicate with our hypothetical interstellar spacecraft? I would think that it would be something akin to simply entangling a whole mess of particles and then manipulating those particles' spins to send messages back home. Am I missing something? Obviously, we don't have the technology for any of this yet but is it theoretically possible?

Also, my apologies if a version of this question has been asked before.

EDIT: My question has been answered. Some very helpful, intelligent people have given me a better understanding of the tangled quagmire that is Quantum Mechanics and I appreciate it. Also, to help me understand this idea more, I'll get some additional back story on this issue. Thanks, Reddit."

Which time travel scenario is the most plausible and most likely to be correct?,109,98,False,False,False,Physics,1504620950,True,"I'm not a physicist, my degree is in philosophy, and my native language/the language I learned in is not English so excuse me if I'm ignorant of proper terms and things of that nature. Time travel is not (yet) possible, so the only reference point that we have for it is in fiction. I have identified three concepts of time travel and it's effects in fiction, and I would like you, as physicists, to tell me which is most likely.


- **The Harry Potter Type**: in the Harry Potter type of Time Travel, time is a fixed and linear path, where everything happens for a reason. You can't change the past and destroy the timeline, because if you go back in time to do something, that means that it was meant to be, and indeed it already happened. I call this the Harry Potter type because in the third Harry Potter book, Harry's life is saved by an unknown person casting a spell, and it turns out that it was he who saved himself, because he went back in time and cast that spell. I think the point of this is that there is an already plan for all time, that cannot be escaped or deviated from, and that everything happens because it is meant to happen.


- **The Back to the Future Type**: In this scenario, things aren't planned, and the present is the result of specific choices, actions and encounters that are apparently random and happen by chance, and if any of these go a different way, the future will be changed significantly. I call this the Back to the Future type, because in the movie Back to the Future, when Marty McFly goes back in time and changes the events of the past, he begins to dissapear, and if the timeline isn't set right he will cease to exist.

- **The Star Trek Type**: In this scenario, when someone goes back in time and changes something, the original future isn't erased, but there is a branching off at the point of divergence, and a new timeline is created. This comes from the Star Trek reboot movie, where the villain travels back in time and destroys the planet Vulcan, leading Kirk, Spock, McCoy etc to take a different path, with different adventures etc. The divergence means that the original stories from Star Trek still happened in the original timeline, but things happen differently. I don't know if this is a serious time travel theory or if it was just something done to avoid the fans being upset by the fact that the adventures that they grew up with no longer happened.



I am a personal believer in things happening for a reason, and in destiny, which leads me to believe that the Harry Potter type scenario is the correct treatment of time travel, but I'm not a physicist. What do you think?"

[basic mechanics] velocity gained by an object pushed by a spring?,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1504679575,True,"i'm trying to work my way through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbALqC8toQ), but using a different method, by kinematically solving for it, but i can't seem to get it right. the whole thing falls apart, because if i just make 1/2kx^2 = 1/2mv^2 + mgµx, i get a velocity several times smaller than what is required to complete the problem.

basically, 1200N/m spring, 0.2 frictional coefficient, compress 0.5m, let the 20kg block slide 5 meters after the spring uncompresses, after which a slope of 30 degrees with 0 friction comes along; how far will the block slide along the slope?

but no, by my velocity, the block will hardly make it past 3 meters on the frictional surface."

Is time relative to where we are?,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1504713722,True,"I read and hear, the idea that if one person travels very fast around a big object (e.g. Star), time slows down for him.
Another scenario, is when a person lives on a mountain, he experiences time moving slower. 
I know there was an experiment that kind of proved it, where a clock placed high above earth, moved slower, then the clock on the ground bottom of earth.

It is because of Newtons law of gravity. Big objects attract smaller objects. And gravity slows the light waves, making them more spread as we move up from earths ground.

But I cant believe that we can make ourselves younger by living somewhere high. Biology tells me that we age more or less the same.
Can a person move around a star so fast for a year.. that when he is back to earth everyone he knew being his age are old and he has grown only by one year?

Isnt there a conflict between biology and physics?"

I'm in an upper level undergraduate course and we have to numerically solve DiffEq's due to drag and other forces. This weeks homework assignment was nearly impossible to me as my prof recommended using either Mathematica (which imo has poor syntax and errors aren't very clear), MatLab (which I'm debating learning, but not a fan of how you have to define things), or excel (which is quite tedious for numerical integration). I know a bit of Python, and a professor last year said that in general it would be good to learn C++ before grad school. 

I also have this online book about learning Python specifically for physics, but once it gets to integrations and such it seems like those things aren't already programmed in. Are there packages available for download that would do the equivalent of NDSolve and Plot in Mathematica for either Python or C++? If so, which do you recommend.

Why is the spacetime algebra expression of QM so niche?,14,33,False,False,False,Physics,1504760794,True,"I find the spacetime algebra expression of the Dirac equation to have a wonderfully meaningful physical interpretation of the spinor representation, while dispelling the mysterious nature of the complex solutions and avoiding all the extra zero or symmetric parameters involved in matrix representations.


And yet despite the advocacy of this paradigm by Hestenes and many others going back decades, this remains very much a minority description of QM (or GR for that matter). I am puzzled.


I will throw out a guess that it is simply a matter of inertia in that so much machinery has been developed for the more orthodox complex matrix approach. One can lazily dismiss STA as ""formally equivalent as a Clifford algebra"" despite the drastically different view it provides. However I am really hoping for some informed opinions.

Question about potential energy effect on *weight* as measured by an ideal scale.,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1504819081,True,"Would two side by side bricks on a scale weigh differently than the two bricks stacked on top of each other (assuming ideal everything to get to the real question of course)?  I can identify two deltas: (1) in the latter situation, the top brick has a tiny bit less gravitational pull due to being raised ever so slightly away from the gravitational center of mass and (2) in the latter situation, the top brick has slightly more potential energy for the same reason.

My initial thought is that when considering weight as measured by a scale, (1) would have a tiny decreasing effect whereas (2) would not effect weight as measured by the scale.

I am being told however that (2) has a more substantial effect and would actually result in the stacked bricks weighing more.  Is that really correct?

I have a question regarding the big crunch theory,9,7,False,False,False,Physics,1504830170,True,"English is not my native but here goes...  
  
So the definition is: *The theory proposes that the universe could collapse to the state where it began and then initiate another Big Bang, so in this way the universe would last forever, but would pass through phases of expansion (Big Bang) and contraction (Big Crunch).*  
  
However IIRR physicists claim that it isn't likely because we can now observe the universe expanding rapidly.   
  
Isn't this a really silly claim to make though?  
  
If I throw a ball into the air at high speed. And the observer lives for 0.2 seconds of the 8 second ""lifespan"" of the ball, which uses 4 seconds to go up and 4 seconds to fall back down, then the observer would see this ball going up at a fast rate. However just because the ball is moving upwards now does not mean it won't come back down. Let's say that in 1 billion years all the black holes eat eachother and merges into one bigger and bigger black hole that eventually manages to suck everything back for a new big bang. 100 years, even a million years, would be an insignificant amount of observation to predict anything at all.  
  
What I'm trying to ask here is... the big crunch theory's counter arguments is basically ""We can see the ball moving up in this one instance of time that amounts to one corn of sand in all the deserts on our planet, therefore it won't ever come down""?  "

Could you dissipate a hurricane with a big enough radial blast within the eye of the storm? I picture a huge radial explosion pushing the swirling winds outward and breaking up the swirling, sort of like sticking your finger inside a whirlpool in the tub and running your finger outward.

If so, how big a bomb would be required? Tsar Bomba size or bigger/smaller?

Third, if this is a possibility, why haven't we tried it? Surely even a nuke in the middle of the ocean would be better than Irma at Cat 5 slamming into Florida?

Sorry if this is a North of North question.,16,0,False,False,False,Physics,1504885949,True,"I have recently discovered the concept of time being static and all time and events happening and existing simultaneously but that consciousness moves through it... well the way it does.  From what we understand to be the past, into the future, but only able to exist in the present. (It's hard to even talk about there being a past future and present except when linked to perception)

It's not wrong to think this right?


If that's true, time is static all events exist at the same time?  Does physics have an explanation for why we can't experience all of time at once?  Am I thinking about this wrong?

I mean I know why we shouldn't.  That would maddening but why isn't our life experienced like a photon with consciousness.  The moment of our birth is the same moment of our death.


I guess this is more of a philosophical question but,  if we experience time like (I think) physics says it exists, instead of how we perceive it as a moving from one event to another, cataloging the past in our memory and anticipating the future, would conscious even exist.  Would anything exist?  I suppose w/o space nothing physical would exist and so w/o time...would it be infinite or zero or both or unknowable. 


Sorry I guess I'm rambling now.  I'm just curious if there is a physics explanation for why our awareness/consciousness ""moves"" through time like it does.

Albert Einstein went to his grave convinced that himself and no one else knew what  ""field quanta"" are, exactly. In a letter in the 1950s he poked fun at a young grad student for supposing he knew what they were.

In the article linked below, professor David J. Baker (of Michigan U)  claims that field quanta are **""obviously not the same thing""** as particles.   

+ http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11375/

Another professor of physics (this time from Arkansas) chimes in.  Dr. Art Hobson presents a list of physical phenomena which he claims that quote,   **""demonstrate that the concept of particles is incompatible with quantum field theories.""** 

+ https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1204/1204.4616.pdf

Despite all the obsession with the fields-only fad (the hottest new thing on campus) the fields themselves are still  defined by the classical force they exert on particles.     

So what are field quanta, and why or why would they not be the ""same thing"" as particles?

Can this question by answered resolutely -- or should we instead resort to the viewpoint of Sir Roger Penrose? .. that QFT gives us no coherent picture of reality at all.

Linear algebra is great, I've read a bit about topology which seems really interesting, and I'm looking forward to taking real analysis this year. But I prefer quantum mechanics and electrodynamics, for instance, so I chose to major in physics instead. It was a last minute decision, actually, and initially I thought it was the right one but now I'm not so sure.

Fundamental theoretical physics is what I'm really interested in, from what I know of it so far at least. Mathematical physics, maybe, I don't know exactly how to distinguish the two. But when I read about the mathematics needed to understand these fields, it worries me a bit. The role of functional analysis in quantum mechanics, group theory for particle physics, and differential geometry for general relativity, just to name the ones I have heard of.

I worries me because I am afraid that I will never be able to understand these things. Physics is too broad, too applied, to ""careless"" to worry about the finer mathematical points. We take the existence of a complete eigenbasis for granted, even if the dimension is infinite!

Physics is great, but I can't help but wonder if I should have chosen differently.

I'm a 12th grade high school student and I want to get in the national physics olympics team. I passed the first exam as the 15th, but there are 3 more exams to go and I have to get into the first 4 ranking.

I thought that was easy, just study everyday and you can do it if you're not stupid. Well, seems that is not going to work. I met with the top 10 and they said they finished morin's mechanics and griffith's E&amp;M in 9th grade, it was taught in their school they said. When I was in 9th grade, I was only self studying calculus and thought that was decent. But they studied these textbooks with one of the best professors in the country employed by their high school long before I did. I have studied both this year, but they had much more time for practice, and a good mentor as well. 

Now the 2nd exam is 3 months away but I'm confident I'll pass that one too. But the one after or the last one... Not so sure  considering that also the last year's team of 4 will be participating again in these exams to get selected a second time. They went to the international olympics, and I'm here like... 15th in my country, yay.

I'm lost. I can't get in the team studying. I need a better method than just studying, but maybe I'm destined to lose. Please, physicists of reddit, I love physics and I need to prove to myself that I'm worthy of studying it. What are your suggestions for a 12th grade student to master undergraduate year 1&amp;2 physics? How do I get in the top 4, or should I give up already?"

Had a Crazy black hole related dream last night,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1505265181,True,"Hey guys, last night I had a crazy dream that has a lot to do with theoretical physics and I wanted to share it and see what you guys have to think about it. I'm sure there are parts of the dream that aren't 100% scientifically accurate, but there is some cool theory in there I figured I shared.

So it all started, I was in a dream.
I was outside with my friend and two homeless people. (idk why they were homeless)
My friend was talking to the homeless people throughout the duration of the dream.
There was a small black hole nearby with a very low mass. It was big enough that I was able to see it with my bare eye though.
The blackhole was slowly moving in some direction but it wasn't dropping towards the earth as one would expect.
I went up to it and started playing around with it. By playing around I mean I put my hand behind it and saw the lensing, and I walked around it and saw how it distorted the stuff behind it.
Of course I had no intention of touching it, but I was for whatever reason feeling daring.
I moved very close to the black hole and as I did this I noticed the conversation in the background started skipping some sentences and words.
I got scared so I back away from the blackhole.
As I backed away, I noticed a somewhat transparent version of me appear near the black hole.
I started backing away and I realized 3 seconds later the version of me started moving in the same path I did. Essentially the 2nd version of me, I'll call it Version B, was on a 3 second delay but did everything that I did. 
I got scared of the black hole so I decided to walk around the black hole and go towards my friend. As I did this, I walked very close to the black hole and again my friend and the homeless people skipped sentences.
As I looked back though, recall I said the black hole was moving. it ended up colliding with Version B, but not Version A because I dodged it.
As the blackhole hit Version B, I recall thinking to myself, it's fucking over, I'm dead. Everything went black then for a few seconds I could see a computer screen with a bunch of symbols and numbers, and I could hear the sound of an alarm.
Then everything went black again and I felt like I was falling for a few seconds, all the while scared shitless.
I quickly then woke up found that my entire body was heated up like crazy and I could feel the heat rising upwards.
After regaining awareness of my surronding, I quickly walked over to my desk and wrote down the events of my dream so I wouldn't forget.

That was my dream, but what happened after that was somewhat weirder. I noticed a few things about my normal life seemed off. The temperature in my room was set to 75 and set to sustain 75 while I slept. I NEVER set the temperature in my room to an odd number. I would have set it to either 74 or 76, never 75.  So that was weird. Later that night, I noticed walking back from classes that a store I usually walk past was replaced by some other store.
And lastly, looking out the window right now as I type this, I could see that the building outside has orange lights on the outside when every single night it has had green lights.

I figure a lot of this weirdness is probably just coincidence and all in my head, and in the case of the store it might be that I just returned to college after a 4 month break and it's possible that the store was replaced from last year semester. But I could have sworn it was around yesterday night and the night before. Anyway I was wondering what you guys thought about this. Also i thought the dream was pretty interesting, and was wondering what other people also thought about it. Ok, that's all for now, am looking forward to your guy's response!"

"Spacetime, past, present, future, predetermination",16,0,False,False,False,Physics,1505284666,True,"Let me redo this original post, as I see I was not clear.  I will use an example.

Let there be two observers, A and B, and they are 1,000,000 light years apart.  They are moving with respect to each other, so each has a different opinion on what is past/present/future.

A is moving so that his idea of current time is one year ahead of B at B's location.  To illustrate this, assume there was a supernova at B's location 999,999 years ago.  A sees this supernova now, and calculates that because of the distance it occurred 1,000,000 years ago.  B says it occured 999,999 years ago, and both are correct, in their frames of reference.

So A's concept of ""now"" is one year ahead of B's. From B's perspective there is a stretch of time from now to one year from now, and A see's that same stretch of time (at B's location) extending from one year in the past to now.  B's future is A's past.

As I understand it, this situation is accepted in space-time as a result of special relativity.

From this it seems that many conclude that since B's future is A's past it is already determined.  So time is really some kind of illusion and everyone's future is already determined.  Everyone already exists in space-time as some kind of 4 dimensional being, so as we pass though time, we are seeing an already determined future.

But I put up for discussion that anything in B's future that is in A's past, is so far from A that A cannot get all the information at B's location.  In fact, in this situation A will not be able to determine what happened at B until almost 1,000,000 years have past.

A's information about B's future is ""fuzzy"", and if something happens that is random or as a result of choice, the consequences of that action will not reach A for many years, even though it is in A's past.

I am proposing that events in A's past can still be changed if A has no way of receiving that information about those events. B still has freedom of choice for the next year as A's ""past"" can still be changed.

Simple question; what frame is t' and which is t?

The equation we use is t'(stationary)=t(moving)γ

However I've seen numerous places use this instead:

t'(moving)=t(stationary)γ

How can we have 2 different equations for the same thing? One gives you t(stationary)&gt;t(moving) as expected while the other gives the opposite.

"Seeking physics degree, eventual PhD &amp; research. Few options, need advice.",23,6,False,False,False,Physics,1505400280,True,"I am 26, I have a BA from Baylor University. However, I am making a complete career change - I intend to study Physics, and therefore I will need to return to get a BS somewhere. I need advice from graduate students, prospective physics students in particular. 


Important Context:


* If I return to Baylor to study physics, I'll need only a total of 43 hours to earn a BS
* If I apply/go to any other University I will likely need to do 3+ years assuming the low end: 1/4 of my core requirements transfer.
* Under the impression Baylor isn't very highly ranked
* Under the impression grad programs don't care about rank
* Grad programs are looking for a great GPA, GRE, and your research/publications or potential to do so


What I need answered: 


* Should I go to Baylor, save time and money?
* Should I apply to my top three alternatives, Santa Barabara, Texas, Colorado Boulder (focus on a more competitive undergrad)?
* Will a less competitive program like Baylor reduce my odds of getting into grad school? (This question requires that you have some knowledge of research opportunities, let me know if you need more info)


Physics school rankings, for the data lovers (based upon the average from four physics programs rankings, national sources) Columbia for scale:


* School // Rank // Tuition // Type


* Columbia - 9 --- $50,000/yr - private
* Santa Barbara - 29 --- $14,000/yr - public
* Texas at Austin - 38 --- $26,000/yr - public
* Colorado Boulder - 50 --- $35,000/yr - ~~private~~ public
* Baylor - 201 --- $40,000/yr - private


My goal is to eventually earn my PhD and become a researcher. I get the sense that undergrad isn't quite worth two extra years...  (please comment if you agree or disagree)


Thanks in advance for any advice, this isn't the simplest question.

**tl;dr** Going for a PhD in Physics, Should I get my undergrad done at Baylor in 2 years, or go to a more competitive school for 4?

...Should I consider transferring schools?,5,1,False,False,False,Physics,1505457950,True,"I'm a freshman majoring in Physics at Clemson University. 
Clemson doesn't exactly seem to be ranked super high in Physics, but I have a passion for it and have my heart set on Grad study at any institution with a great physics program.  The physics program here appears to be pretty good - it's pretty small, but there are a couple professors doing research I'm super interested in.  I'm more interested in the theoretical side of things though, which is already an extremely difficult thing to get into.  I went here because it was the best in-state college I could go to, next to USC-Columbia (which had a nearly identical ranking with Clemson in Physics, but their entire school is more business focused and Clemson is engineering focused).  In-state is what I can afford without getting uncomfortably into debt.  If I truly love physics though, should I consider transferring to a better ranked school for physics?  Is it too late to consider that?  After all, it's best to start undergraduate research early on, and if I transfer to another school then I'll have less time to work with professors there for research.  Many students make the decision to dive into extreme debt for what they want to study, and I feel like my love for physics goes beyond even that, but at the same time I was raised by a frugal family and taught that debt is a nightmare.  I have a brother-in-law that went to Georgia Tech, so I was offered a Conditional Transfer Path-Way for them, which I guess means if I apply there I'm given more priority as a transfer student.  They are only about an hour or two away from Clemson, yet they are out of state so it would cost me maybe $40,000 more per year, putting me over $100,000 into debt as opposed to what I plan to be a little over $10,000 in debt at my current school.  

I'm really worried that while my school seems to be amazing, and is ranked #23 in top public schools, it isn't necessarily that great for physics in particular.  I feel like the only reason my school is even ranked #23 overall for top public schools is because it's like the national champions in football and it has great non-academic-related rankings, such as #1 safest school in the country, Top 10 happiest students, and so forth."

However, there's another program - an engineering program - which I'll be qualified to attend next year, which blew my mind. Its main focus is on satelitte / aerosapce technology with a minor focus on geophysics.

Obiviously, I won't do a strawpoll and pick the one with most votes.However, I'd love to hear if anybody has any experience in working as an satelite / aerospace engineer or as a (geo)scientist for a space company / research institution. 

I think the reason why the decision is so difficult for me, is that I have no idea how a day in the life of either positions would be. Courses in one thing, but how does a geophysicist contribute to the exploration of Mars or what is the process for a satelite engineer when working on a project? These are the kinda things I really know nothing about and I'd really appreciate ANY information you guys contribute with!

Thanks Reddit!"

I ve been bothered by some facts about physics and i am looking for answers.

1) There are four fundamental forces - yet 3 of them seems like forces and gravity seems like spacetime curvature - so how are these 4 forces always mentioned together if gravity is quite different? 

2) Gravity is curvature of spacetime right? Einstein was thinking in a way that ""Earth is accelarating towards you"" - can someone explain this to me? 

3) There is always visualisation of gravity as flat space - is it just to imagine this more easily or is this actually right ? Is spacetime flat or flatter? OR is it never eneding 3D-4D space? (11 dimensions away for now) 

4) Quantum gravity theory is not complete, cause there is no way to measure gravity at Planck scale right? Or is there any other problem? 

Thank you for your answers :) looking forward to get this mind bug out of my head and install new mind bugs right after!"

Acceleration when both turning and speeding up,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1505683615,True,"So, as I've mentioned previously, I'm a high school physics teacher. Looking for some help understanding acceleration when an object is both turning and changing speed.

For instance, I made up the following situation, if a 10 kg object is traveling 20 m/s and then a 50N constant force is applied to it for 8 s and then the object is moving 30 m/s. I know how to calculate the angle that it was redirected. I know there is 400Ns of impulse, so since it is a 10 kg object, the change in velocity must have a magnitude of 40 m/s. So, then you can set up a triangle and solve for the angles using law of cosines, and you end up with about 76 degrees.

So, I can calculate all that stuff, but what about the acceleration? It seems like it should be possible to consider the acceleration that caused it to increase in speed as one thing and then the acceleration that caused it to change directions as a separate thing. The object sped up by 10 m/s in 8 seconds. So that's 1.25 m/s^2 of acceleration. I was thinking there should be a a way to determine the other acceleration in terms of centripetal acceleration, but the only way I can do it is by imagining that there is an orthogonal acceleration to the resultant vector that has an acceleration of 5sqrt15/4. But, the object doesn't just instantaneously turn. 

Is there a way to calculate a centripetal acceleration in this types of problem? Or do you have to just split it up into two orthogonal accelerations? I know with Calculus you can take the integral, but I'm trying to come up with an easier way to understand it without using calculus if that's at all possible."

So, let me make sure I've got a little background down. I understand that an entangled pair teleports its state. I understand that time flows more slowly in the vicinity of mass. I understand that information travels at the speed of light. These will be the basis for the postulate I'll present. If I am misinterpreting any of these statements, please point it out.

Suppose I produce an entangled pair (A,B) here on Earth. I begin collapsing A at a regular frequency by observation. While B is nearby, its state collapses at the same frequency.

Resources on Black Holes for the undergrad,13,2,False,False,False,Physics,1505870488,True,"Hi everyone,

I've been assigned to write a paper/report on Black Holes, going through things like:

- creation and formation
- information loss
- hawking radiation
- basic description of them.

It's meant to be a minimum of 15 pages, so it should obviously be somewhat thorough. The class is a Modern Physics class, not a GR one, so I'm not expected to delve deeply into Einstein's Field equations as I would in a GR class paper. This paper is meant to account for the Astrophysics credit of the class (20% of final grade), so it is a bit heavy duty.

-----------------------

**What resources should I use to prepare for this, given I have 2 months to write it?**

I know that black holes are mainly a product of GR, so I was thinking of picking up a textbook on it, but I'm not sure if it would be feasible within the two month timeframe.

My level is:

- Strong in Linear Algebra and Operators (would not be afraid to venture into Tensors) 

- Strong in Real analysis 

- Functional analysis @ halfway through Kreyszig

- Complex analysis @ halfway through Churchill/Brown

- Come from a career in programming so I'm not afraid of computational stuff

- Mechanics @ the level of Kleppner and Kolenkow

- Thermal Physics @ the level of Blundell/Reif

- Optics @ halfway through Hecht

- EM @ halfway through Griffiths"

Physics undergrad with questions about future,17,9,False,False,False,Physics,1505889682,True,"Hello again, I've posted before on this sub and received some helpful responses, so I'm again consulting the internet for more help. Im now a little ways into the first semester of my junior year at a liberal arts school that's decently ranked nationally but with little recognition in terms of physics. My first year and a half here I was a little lost in terms of general direction in terms of what I hoped to study, as well as what I want to do when I do finally graduate, and my grades definitely reflect that. 

My GPA prior to declaring a physics major with a math minor was an embarrassingly low 2.4. However, in my fourth semester I achieved around a 3.4 GPA while in 2 math courses, a physics course and an english class that I needed to take in order to reach graduation requirements (Liberal Arts schools am i right?). Thus far, I've completed calculus one, calculus 2, and two principles of physics courses, 

This semester I am in a foundations of math course (with the main focus being on ""topics selected from Boolean algebra, combinatorics, functions, graph theory, matrix algebra, number theory, probability, relations, and set theory."" A course I am mainly taking as a prerequisite for linear algebra (covering Vector spaces, linear transformations, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors and applications). I am also in a physics mathematical methods course (covering partial differentiation, vector analysis, complex numbers, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, multiple integrals, and Fourier series). As well as an optics course (covering Experimental investigation of geometrical and physical optics. Specific topics investigated include: image formation by lenses and mirrors, optical instruments, image processing, interference, diffraction, polarization, optical communication, lasers and holography). 

All of this being said, I have total confidence that I can maintain a 3.5 GPA, on a 4 point scale, through the rest of my undergraduate career. Especially given my newfound love for physics and specifically much of the advanced math in behind it (possibly more so than the physics itself). 

The reasoning behind this post is that I am now seriously considering further schooling beyond undergraduate in physics. However, with mostly only background courses covered so far I have little to no idea what I would like to specialize in, nor have I participated in any kind of research program. If that doesn't make it clear enough I worry that my current statistics as well as my lack of research experience would make it very difficult to attend a highly or even decently ranked physics PHD program. 

I have an open offer from a couple of family friends, most promisingly to intern at a REIT and with a little bit more researching and networking may be able to find different opportunities elsewhere. 

Now, the point of this post is this, I would love to pursue a further education in physics, but if given my current lackluster academic and research experience I'm unsure how realistic that that is. I have a number of family members who work as financial analysts in some capacity and would also be interested in work of that nature, if further schooling in physics does not work out. 

So I ask you reddit, do you believe that if I am able to maintain a high gpa (currently a 3.5 in math/physics but a 2.65 cumulative), will I have a shot at admission to a respectable program upon graduation? Assuming some kind of research this summer (I can quite easily find something through my own school through good relations with professors, or perhaps there's an REU program that you can recommend that I apply too if that may be more attractive to admissions offices). Or should I take the hit and try for an internship that will better set me up for a career post graduation?

edit: I would also love any suggestions that any of you may have regarding future courses to take, recommendations based on my previously mentioned love for math and it's interesting applications to physics itself.

It claims to be useful because the argon will sink in air and cover a layer of finish/paint in a nonreactive ""sheet"". 

Now, this is useful for me, because I'm looking to make a large (50mm diameter, 5mm wall, 9~ inch long) low-pressure pure argon ampoule.

My question regards the validity of the argon displacement: is it a 100% true? If it is, then making the ampoule will be easy- I can just spray the argon into a tube (longer than the finished tube), seal the tube with by way of a valve, then hook it up to a vacuum pump to lower the pressure (side question- what's the lowest safe pressure for a tube like this?). Then I could seal the glass by torch at a length of 9 inches and I'd be left with a finished, valveless ampoule.

If someone has a better idea of how I could achieve this, I would greatly appreciate it. "

How to stay in physics,24,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506017439,True,"Hi guys i'm a current first year physics undergrad here. I've loved physics in every way since my very first physics class. In high school, I had the greatest physics teacher. Being a former research associate at cern he introduced me to aspects of physics far beyond anything I would've heard of myself. He recommended online lecture series and helped me with the corresponding assignments and I learned so much from it.

However, now that I'm in college, my first year classes are ridiculously easy. Third week of class and we are still doing constant acceleration. Having taken calculus based mechanics a few years ago, it's so hard to sit through lecture about vectors and hooke's law and the idea of a mass spring oscillator all over again. How can I further my knowledge of physics by myself before I go crazy?? I understand that the basics are extremely important but I can't stand to push back learning any new topics for another year. 

What do you guys think?

Edit: Any resources for self learning physics would be appreciated. Might as well make use of my time while i'm here. I've already gone through some of the stuff on edx and mit ocw.

An issue with valences.,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1506023301,True,"As far as I was aware up until minutes ago, all atoms strive to have the maximum possible number of electrons in their most outer shell (said number being 8, generally), and they are able to do so either by sharing or borrowing some from another atom. This explains the concept of 'valence', and why, say, an Alkaline metal's valence is always +1 while a Noble Gas (aside from Kripton and Argon, apparently) has no valence whatsoever, but little did I know that what I once was taught in school is partially a lie - allow me to explain myself:

While it's true that, as an example, Oxygen is pretty much always eager to receive two electrons in order to become stable in a way, under certain conditions it turns out that it can choose to obtain only 1 instead; this occurs in Peroxides, and can be visualized in the formula H2O2.


In addition, gases like Nitrogen and Phosphorous not only can give away 3 or 5 electrons, but even form compounds such as NO2, NO, and H3PO4 (I understand the logic behind the structure of this last mention, but it's hard for me not to complain about how, arguably, well HPO3 would work; either way, it looks unusual), which lacks sense and seems irrational to me - due to my ignorance, for sure; I'm not saying chemists are mistaken.


Summarizing, my questions are as follows: through a physical explanation, what dictates the number of valences an element can have? What really takes place when two elements fuse into a compound? Is it not rather arbitrary, at least the way teachers present this information? Why teach children such misconceptions instead of explaining to them the whole truth?

How to calculate the period of oscillation of a mathematical pendulum inside an elevator?,12,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506037235,True,"I have a physics test on saturday and I can't understand this one problem and it has appeared a lot on previous exams according to past students. 

I know that I only care about the movement in X, and I know that the sumatory of the forces in x should be mgsinx = ma.

What I don't know, and this is where my problem starts, is if the acceleration that mgsinx is equal to is the acceleration of the pendulum according to the earth or to the elevator itself.

For relative movement the expression should be: Ap/e = Ap/t -Ae/t. Knowing that either Ap/e or Ap/t is -gsenx, and that Ae/t is the acceleration of the elevator, and that it should also be multiplied but sinx since I'm taking my reference system in the same direction as the tension in the pendulum I somehow have to reach the expression -gsinx = sinx(g + Ae/t). Which would let me apply the differential formula and solve my problem for w. But how do I do it? 

Ap/e = Acceleration of the pendulum according the elevator
Ap/t= acceleration of the pendulum according the earth
Ae/t= Acceleration of the elevator according the earth.

How do you picture/rationalize additional dimensions?,64,34,False,False,False,Physics,1506091206,True,"In the loosest, most pedestrian definition, I'm a physics buff.  If I would have realized how much I enjoyed it when I was 18 I likely would have pursued it, but it wasn't until after college that I found myself spending a lot of time reading as much as I could.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I've never had too much trouble with at least being able to loosely ""understand"" some of the equations and math involved, but where I constantly fall off is the more irrational or abstract thinking that can be useful or even necessary.  When it comes to understanding and rationalizing dimensions other than the three we live in, I hit a wall.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Yes, I said three.  Time is also one I struggle with.  Intuitively time is not ""real"" to me and is a man made concept, but I know that isn't true thanks to relativity.  So even though I know things like time dilation happen and show that time is more than just humanity's attempt to make sense of events happening and disappearing, I can't completely wrap my head around it.  This could just be semantics.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The same goes for extra dimensions.  From Extra Universal dimensions to string theory and it's 10-26 dimension requirement.  I can't completely grasp the idea.  I get it, and can look at equations all day, but doing that eventually leads to those dimensions becoming linked to symbols on a piece of paper rather than what they really are.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So what do you do to help picture these possible dimensions?  I realize ""picture"" may not be the right word as our mind has only ever really visualized things in 3 dimensions.  Is it better to just accept that it's not possible to completely comprehend it for now and instead just view them as symbols in equations?

[Astrophysics] Universal Re-ignition Theory,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506108827,True,"Before I begin, let me include the Heat Death theory. Now that that's done I think that would give you a better understanding about what I'm trying to say.

So firstly, we know that the universe will ""die"". Not in the context of becoming nonexistent but in the context that nothing ever comes into being at all.

Now mentioning Heat Death: Simply put, it's where the universe achieves thermal equilibrium. No heat difference, no work. No work, nothing ever becomes at all. However, this is gradual. The universe doesn't just all of a sudden stop working. Remember that the theory of heat death complements the second law of Thermodynamics as in such an event, the universe achieves maximum entropy.

So basically, the universe continues to expand, cool down, and eventually loses heat to keep itself ""alive"". Now what?

Here's where the theory starts. Since theoretically, the universe has already died and has ceased to be (this is always in a way. It's still there just not able to do anything), it could be considered as nothing.

If it's nothing, then it would complement the idea that the universe ""began"" from nothing. The Big Bang releases matter and antimatter during the process, leaving behind pure energy and thus, the universe began expanding, or did it?

This theory complements the idea of the universe being omnipresent, without breaking the laws of thermodynamics, as well as modifying our current understanding of the Big Bang.

So basically, let's image this: The omnipresent universe still runs through the course of thermodynamics, equilibrium is achieved and it's doomed. However, everything remains, only then it is in a dormant state. There is just nothing to be done with it.

Now let's focus on the ""Big Bang"". Let's postulate that instead of the Big Bang releasing matter and it's counterparts, converting them into pure energy and etc. Let's just say that the ""Big Bang"" was energy that suddenly heated up, shared that heat to the ""dormant"" energies and this then accelerates, at which energy fluctuates in temperature once again.

It won't be necessarily a bang, an expansion wouldn't it? Because theoretically, it shouldn't be. Remember that we classified the universe as omnipresent, meaning that it'll always be there and the ""Big Bang"" simply (as the title suggests) reignites, making us believe that it's expanding but it actually just turns the dormant energy back on.

Since energy is ""reignited"", matter can then exist along with antimatter and with the assistance of gravity, proceed to how we now know it.

So TL;DR: I theorized that the universe is ""there"", it always is. I also theorized that the Big Bang wasn't an expansion, but a re-ignition for already existing energy. I know that this ""theory"" must've been far beyond unacceptable, but I found it quite tickling to write so I would ask you, and anyone about to read this theory to help me figure out the flaws. Hell maybe even tell me to scrap it. It's not like I'm Brian Greene and this is the String Theory, right?

Anyways, my point is of why I thinking this works at the time of writing is that: Well we believe the universe came from nothing and nothing sparks something, why won't we believe anything ever so contradicting?

Cheers! Have a good one."
Scientific and philosophical implications IF the Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation of Quantum Mechanics were proven to be correct?,5,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506108883,True,"Title, also I have sort of a second question. When laymen use the word ""observe"" when talking about QM it is hastily corrected by physicists telling them that it is just ""interaction"" or ""decoherence"" with the environment that collapses a state of probabilities into a definite state that we see and has absolutely nothing to do with actually observing the particle.  What then do you make of the so called ""interaction free measurement"" or ""decoherence free measurement"" of the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester) tested by Anton Zeilinger that shows you can ascertain the presence of an object, inside an interferometer without interacting with it.

Looking for advice regarding potential upcoming static equilibrium problem.,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1506122529,True,"My professor mentioned that the class is likely going to have a static equilibrium problem with seven strings/ropes/whatevers.  I think they may have said there would be three masses involved in the problem, but I'm not sure.  The professor did say they weren't too concerned with finding the exact numbers of the tension and really just wanted us to show seven equations that showed we understood how to get the answers.  

This actually seems a little more difficult to me than finding the answers, especially if he ends up not giving any numbers and just asks us to derive equations.  I know how to do basic static eq problems, but I'm curious if anyone here has advice on whether or not multiple masses and strings(negligible weight on the strings btw) is just as easy to tackle or maybe videos showing solutions to similar problems."

Tips for AP Physics C: Mechanics &amp; Electricity &amp; Magnetism Test?,6,1,False,False,False,Physics,1506146227,True,"Hello, I am a current senior in high school, and I have done well in my accelerated physics class last year. I always got 95s(without curve) on unit exams for both mechanics and E&amp;M, so I thought I was more than prepared for AP physics C. Currently, I just took my third unit exam, which covers newton's laws, drag equations, and circular motion. Oh god, I was completely wrong. 

These tests in my current class are absolutely brutal. The format for these exams are the following: 15 multiple choice questions and some free response questions all in the duration of one hour. And, most people do not even finish these exams. These exams are notoriously difficult to the point that a curve exists for them; generally, a 70 is a 90, and people get C's on these tests even with the curve. 

I have known and have been preparing for yesterday's exam for the past week. I have been doing homework problems from the textbook way before their due dates. Not only that, but I took a  multiple choice test and frq from Princeton Review two days before the exam, and I did well on those. 

Moments after I handed in my exam with my trembling hands, I thought deeply and locked myself in delirium for the entire day. I wanted to look for excuses for why I performed so bad on these tests. 

Regarding the past two tests, I had an average of 94 with the curve, so that means I average about low 80s in reality, which saddens me because they are not like the 95s I have consistently received on last year's exams. I am constantly mad at myself for not being able to even get 90s without the curve on the AP physics unit exams, even though my teacher genuinely insists that I am doing fine. 

I am going crazy. These practice problems that I do in Princeton Review are nothing like the actual exam itself, and it only worries me even more as we get closer to May, 2018.Being an enthusiastic math and physics student, I want to graduate senior year knowing that I tried my best in physics with grades I want to achieve. I want to hand in my AP exam with warm hands and smiles to the proctor knowing that I aced the exam. 

In order to accomplish this, I would like to turn to you guys. What should I do? What resources will truly prepare me for an exam with such a high caliber of difficulty? Should I just try to be content with my scores and enjoy my senior year with friends instead? Please, feel free to give advice on how I should handle both exams. I want a 5 on both of them. Thank you all. 

TLDR; I suck at these exams and want to learn how to get better in order to get a 5 on both AP Physics C exams. "

"Historian of physics Helge Kragh on the myth that Fred Hoyle coined the term ""Big Bang"" as a term of derision",6,33,False,False,False,Physics,1506229125,True,"Kragh, in his article ""What's in a Name: History and Meanings of the Term “Big Bang”""  writes:

*It is possible that Gamow felt Hoyle’s “big bang” to be a pejorative phrase, but there is no documentation that either Gamow, Lemaître or other protagonists of explosion cosmologies at the time felt offended by the term – or that they paid
attention to it at all. In any case, with the later success of the big bang theory it
became common to see Hoyle’s neologism as an attempt to make the idea of an
explosion universe, and Gamow’s version of it in particular, sound ridiculous. This is
not how Hoyle saw it. At the time he seems to have considered it just an apt but
innocent phrase for a theory he was opposed to, and he later insisted that he had not
thought of it in a derogatory sense. In an interview of 1989, Alan Lightman asked
him if he was really the source of the name. Hoyle answered 
""Well, I don’t know whether that’s correct, but nobody has challenged it, and I would
have thought that if it were incorrect somebody would have said so. I was constantly
striving over the radio – where I had no visual aids, nothing except the spoken word –
for visual images. And that seemed to be one way of distinguishing between the
steady-state and the explosive big bang. And so that was the language I used.""*

*As a broadcaster Hoyle needed word pictures to get over technical and conceptual points, and “big bang” was one of them. When he had to explain the expansion of the
universe, he made extensive use of the inflating-balloon image that had first been introduced by Eddington in 1931 to illustrate a positively curved space with
increasing radius. Likewise, to illustrate the slow rate of matter creation in the
steady state theory, Hoyle appealed to pictures familiar to all Britons. In his first BBC
broadcast he explained that it would take about one billion years until a new atom
was created in “a volume equal to a pint of milk bottle”. And the
next year he said about the creation rate that it was “no more than the creation of one
atom in the course of about a year in a volume equal to St. Paul’s Cathedral”
The standard view, to be found in numerous books and articles, is the one
reported in a popular book by Nobel laureate astrophysicist George Smoot and his
coauthor Keay Davidson. “Hoyle had meant the term [big bang] to be derogatory,”
they say, “but it was so compelling, so stirring of the imagination, that it stuck, but
without the negative overtones”. As we shall see, it
took twenty years until the term was seen as compelling and stirring of the
imagination.*

No idea how to go about approaching my future in physics,8,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506235937,True,"I always used to think I was going into pure physics, I'd work in academia with a research position and that would be that.

"Experimental vs theoretical physics, or somewhere in the middle?",25,64,False,False,False,Physics,1506238492,True,"I recently started a research program in astrophysics, doing simulations and largely theory work. I've had this project broadly planned for about 3 years already and have some previous experience with the topic so I know what I'm getting into somewhat, but for some reason, I never saw it as ""theoretical physics"". I'm still finishing off some old experimental work, and my supervisor has made a few jokes about how I'm a theoretician and not an experimentalist, which is what has spurred my worry. 

At the end of high school, I was convinced that I wanted to study theoretical physics and discover something new in QM, like most students when they start out. Turns out I'm not a great fan of pure mathematics and abstract algebra (and I don't think I could hack it either) but I really love calculus and applied mathematics, so I put myself more in the experimentalist camp in my own head. I'm not really very good at labs either, but I made it work by pairing up with someone who's great with the experiments but not so great with the theory. All throughout undergrad, they were the lead for the nitty-gritty experimental stuff and I lead in the theory, so our final reports ended up pretty good. 

I like the kind of work that I'm doing at the moment and I think it suits my strengths well, but it feels like a bit of an odd niche to be sitting in. I have no skill or comfort with equipment, but I don't really have the aptitude for math to be what many would consider a 'real' theoretician either. 

Is this going to disadvantage me in the future? Should I work on planting myself more squarely in one camp or the other, or are the distinctions pretty arbitrary? By that I mean, should I:

 - get more comfortable with the equipment side of things, or

 - learn more pure mathematics?

I intend to head into academia, but of course it's a tough market to crack and things might change for me by the time I've graduated. "

Einstein suggested that the same explanation could be applied to gravity as mass distorts space-time and thus a positive force is applied to push two masses towards each other. 
Bearing this in mind, why can the strong force, the weak force and the electromagnetic force described as being an 'attraction' between two things? 
Have I fundamentally misunderstood something here or is it possible that these forces are the result of a similar differential that applies a positive 'push.'
It seems to me that if electromagnetism is viewed as a fluid pattern instead of a static field then it could explain why it is so weak with increased distance. I imagine a fan or turbine in an enclosed space, creating a positive and negative side which would generate an airflow of a very similar shape to a magnetic field.

Tidal force - what's actually correct? Vector forces or the gravitational differential explanation,15,27,False,False,False,Physics,1506406924,True,"Hi :)
I'm trying to understand tides. But it seems like my sources and myself is a bit confused.

In the Space-Times explanation on youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4), he claims the ordinary explanation of gravitational difference isn't correct. You know with the points on earth
https://i.imgur.com/yyuypDj.png

And the video says the correct explanation has to do with vector forces like so:
https://i.imgur.com/4OUy2jr.png

But in my book ""Classical Mechanics"" John Taylor, He gives the explanation that should be wrong according to the video. After that Taylor says we can also give more qunttative argument and then use the vector force to describe it. (page 331 if you have the book)

So please help me understand if both exlanations are actually correct. Or did i just confuse myself. Thank you very much!"

Does it matter where you get your undergraduate physics degree?,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506431697,True,"Hi, I'm an international student in the UK (senior) looking to study in the US. Since I would need to sell a kidney to pay for the top school tuitions, I'm looking at Universities with physics departments that are less well known. One of these is Washington University in St Louis, which I could get good financial aid since my stats are higher than average there, and it's not as popular with internationals than the Ivy Leagues or MIT or Stanford etc.

My issue is whether this would be a detriment in any way. I understand that physics is the same no matter where it's taught, but would to going to a lesser known and much lower ranked physics college affect my undergraduate research and graduate prospects? Would the physics students me pushed to do loads of different and exciting courses, or would the course variety be limiting and stagnant? Have any of you guys been to a lesser known college but ended up successful physicists?

Let's get serious : Quantum Fluctuations and Vacuum Energy.,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1506442120,True,"Where is the most likely place to measure quantum fluctuations acting on matter (or matter itself fluctuating)  in an empirical/laboratory setting?   

Related question : In which substrate does theory suggest the 'strongest' fluctuations should manifest, even if our technology is out of the grasp of such experiments?

I might claim that the fluid phase of electrons in cryogenic superconductors is the best experimental setting for measuring quantum fluctuations. I might be wrong in that claim , and please correct me as you see fit. I'm here to learn.  

The standard model produces theoretical predictions of the strength (or ""loudness"")  of the noise to be found in the background of the vacuum. That chalkboard calculation predicts that quantum fluctuations should contain more energy than a solid brick wall, by a factor of a thousand million million.  That's fine, and I don't really want to expand on that topic. Rather, I am interested in literature which describes **experimental measurements** of random quantum fluctuations, and what value (heat/field strength/entropy/etc) is measured in those settings.   I understand that it's going to be very very weak relative to work-a-day energies of room-temperature regimes, and likely small enough that it may only become physically measurable against background thermal noise in Bose-Einstein condensates.  But I could be wrong-- you tell me.  

TLDR;  I'm up-to-speed on the concepts surrounding quantum fluctuations a la Heisenberg. I'm ready to start talking raw empirical numbers now. Looking for the best literature on the serious lab work. Thanks.

What kind of software is used while studying for a Bachelor's degree?,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506442553,True,"I have just started my Bachelor's and I was looking for a laptop to use for taking notes, browsing and watching movies mainly.

Question about Multiverses.,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1506442802,True,"I realize that the multiverse theory isn't properly proven but I find it difficult to wrap my head around the statement that there are infinitely many universes, given the theory is true. I mean, wouldn't there only be as many universes as there are possible combinations of all atoms in the universe. For simplicity, assume the observable universe was all there was to the universe. That would account for (10^80)! possible arrangements of all atoms and therefore universes (?). Since there is a finite amount of matter in the universe wouldn't an analogous line of thought follow for the entirety of the universe (including things we can't observe-- unless the theory allows for universes with different amounts of matter than ours)?

This is, of course, assuming that single atom differences between universes is enough to distinguish them as two separate universes. 

Or is all this just nonsense and there is actual, concrete rigor to the theory that I'm missing? Sorry if this is a dumb question. "

A little help with blackbody photon gas calculations for thermonukes?,15,4,False,False,False,Physics,1506447442,True,"Good day nerds,
I'm in the process of designing a thermonuclear explosive, generally called a Hydrogen bomb, but I need a hand with one calculation. 
For a bit of perspective, thermonukes work as follows:
A plutonium/uranium fission bomb (called primary stage) sits inside a radiation case, along with a fusion capsule (secondary)
To simplify, the type of fission bomb I'm using consists of a spherical plutonium core, surrounded by conventional plastic explosives. These compress the core, neutrons are injected and the fission reaction starts. This heats the core, causing it to emit black body radiation, which then fills the radiation case, and impinges on the secondary stage to compress it and ignite a fusion reaction. 
Again, that's incredibly simplified, if anyone's interested in more detail, just ask. 
I'm clueless about the behaviour of photon gas. 
The peak temperature of my plutonium core is 50 million kelvin. It has a surface area of 0.014m^2 and a volume of 152cm^3. 
It emits x-rays of 21.4 KeV. 
So, what I'm trying to work out is the parameters (e.i. fluence, radiation density, radiation temperature, radiation pressure, photon energy, etc.) of this gas when allowed into expand into a container (the radiation case) of 23,500cm^3. 
Thanks in advance. "
Pls check my understanding of red/blueshift,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1506448439,True,"I’m hoping you can check my understanding of red/blueshift and maybe clarify a couple of things I’m having trouble understanding.


Is it correct that redshift occurs when the wave length is stretched out and the frequency decreases?  Amplitude should stay the same though right?


There are two ways redshift can happen.  The distance between the energy source and the observer is increasing and/or energy loss.  Because EM waves need to move at a constant speed (in a vacuum) the only way to shed energy is decrease frequency causing wave lengthening?


When red/blueshift occurs due to distance increasing/decreasing between the source and the observer does the lengthening and contracting of wave lengths have anything to do with space dilation because of relative *velocity* (I hope I'm using that term right here)?

Help a year 3 Physics undergrad make the right decision,14,3,False,False,False,Physics,1506449746,True,"I desperately need help in deciding whether to apply to grad school or start preparing for work in the industry. I've been very anxious throughout these last few years because of all this uncertainty, majority of which stems from my inability to choose a career path. But this semester is when I just have to decide.


Background: physics major at a top 30 university, top 10 in Asia. Courses I've taken/am taking: Linear Alg, Calc 3, CM 1, EM 1, Thermodynamics, Information Physics, Probability, Statistical Inference, OOP and Data structures

My grades in physics courses are reasonable, math courses not so great. Overall cga falls in the top 15 percent


Almost a year of research experience under a professor specializing in applied statistical physics, network dynamics, statistical neuroscience. Work mainly included carrying out simulations in python and reviewing literature

One summer's worth of experience in applied computer vision on a big data problem


So I have narrowed down my choices to two. Apply to graduate programs for computational neuroscience OR start working in the industry as a data analyst until i make enough to afford a master's in stats/applied stats etc and then think about what to do.

I like statistics, i like programming (but don't love the idea of developing software for other people). I like learning physics, i like anything that follows the framework of thinking that physics requires, a 'first principles'/'quantitative analysis' type of thinking.

I'm not sure i like research that much, I'm too impatient to figure out the nuances of a system, and too dumb to do it quickly. And my work ethic is poor. But on the other hand, the work in research is not as mind numbingly boring as the work you get in the industry with just a bachelor's

"When, and to what Extent, does General Relativity Become Relevant",7,3,False,False,False,Physics,1506450972,True,"Hi there, guys, I hope this is the right sub, but r/askphysics didn't seem appropriate. There's a TL;DR at the bottom, but first the full version of the question:

I'm a UK high school student with an interest in physics that takes the computer science qualifications at school. Part of this involves a project, and for mine, I have decided to make a Newtonian gravity simulator complete with a visualisation of the evolution of an n-body problem. Part of this task has ended up being that I must include an approximation for the precision of all my results due to both inaccuracies in the numerical integration AND because of the effect of both special and general relativity.

Because I've read around modern physics a little, I know how I intend to take special relativity into account. With each body I will perform a numerical integration of the lorentz factor over the time that the simulation runs, and the special relativistic inaccuracy of that body will be proportional to the result. Obviously I'm not writing a relativistic simulation here, but this should give a rough indication of the extent to which my result can be trusted, since the larger the lorentz factor has averagely been, the more significant the relativistic correction would be.

I'm looking for a similar method to employ to approximate the inaccuracy due to general relativity. I included the special relativistic correction since I intend for the user to be able to (with Newtonian physics) model very fast-moving (relative to one-another) bodies and, since I intend to allow the inclusion of bodies at black-hole mass and volumes, I must indicate how wrong my simulation is here, too.

The best idea I have at the moment (since I know that GR becomes relevant in accelerating reference frames and therefore high-gravity scenarios) is to simply numerically integrate some scaled magnitude of the acceleration of each particle and use this exactly like I intend to use the Lorentz factor, but I have no way of knowing if this is anywhere near the right track. I am also considering integrating some function of the acceleration which (much like the lorentz factor tends to infinity as speed does to light speed) tends to infinity as a body approaches another's schwarzchild radius. My rudimentary research into general relativity shows me nothing analogous to the Lorentz factor, presumably since GR is a field theory unlike SR, and obviously at my level, I cannot manipulate Einstein's field equations in any helpful manner.

Therefore my question is, in short this:

TL;DR: is there anything I can use to estimate how relevant GR is in a similar way to the Lorentz factor in SR?

Thanks!"

I'm a doctor-in-training considering a second career in physics or engineering. How stupid am I?,19,5,False,False,False,Physics,1506461223,True,"Hey all,

I'm a 29-year-old MD. I was a physics major in undergrad, then I went to med school. Now I'm doing my residency.

I'll keep this brief. My chosen specialty (psychiatry) is in high demand at the moment. After I graduate from residency, I am likely to make a six-figure salary working about 40h/week. I currently owe about $500k (I have loans from both undergrad and med school).

I loved physics in undergrad, and thought it was the most interesting subject that I've ever encountered. However, I chose to do medicine because I thought that the human interactions with patients would be intrinsically fulfilling. And they are - to an extent. But as I get further in clinical medicine, I am discovering how much I hate the interrupted and punctuated schedule of seeing patients. I realize that I want to sit at my desk and just work deeply on interesting problems - I don't want to constantly be getting paged that my next patient is here. I miss the deep problem solving of physics. I spend my evenings reading and trying to recreate the deep focus that I used to feel. I even bought a QM textbook and started working on it for this reason.

I have this idle fantasy where I work my ass off for 4-5 years and pay off my debt/make it manageable, then go to physics or engineering grad school. After that I'd want to get a job that allows me to have that uninterrupted focus. It doesn't have to be purely academic - but it would be nice to have it involve complicated problem solving.

Is this a stupid idea? Is there anybody here who has done physics as a second career? What are your thoughts?"

I just did my experiment yesterday, which involved launching rockets straight up. I calculated the altitude reached by measuring the angle to the tip of the parabola from 50m away and using trig to find the opposite side.
I thought it'd be funny to  try aim my remaining rocket at a picture of jim jong un and donald trump (https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/gvcrao2z9cgs14sapnmd.jpg)

I'm trying to figure out how to do it, and i thought you guys might be able to help me. I need to figure out how a directly vertical rocket launch can be translated to a horizontal shot, also factoring in windspeed. All i can find on the subject is an article on how how hezbollah fires rockets at israel and so i'm definately on some sort of watch list by now.
Heres all my data
My rockets weigh 73g, have 24.05g KNO3 and 12.95g Glucose.
The theoretical enthalpy of combustion (hess's law) for each rocket is -99.32kJ and the empirical amount needed based on PE = m x g x h is 
Rocket #1 - 25 J
Rocket #2 - 32 J 

Rocket 1 took 2.91 seconds to reach a 35.01m altitude
and rocket 2 took 3.73 seconds to reach 45.82m

Rocket 1 was displaced 48m away from the launch site, 181 degrees south
Rocket 2 was displaced 55m away from the launch site, 161 degrees south east
Wind was 19km/h north so i'm not sure why they went south. maybe it was slight deviation in launch angle.

I'm not looking for anything to complicated. I'm going to go out sometime this week to try and do it, accuracy in hitting the target doesn't matter given that my rockets are shit and don't even have  a nozzle or fins, i just want to impress my lecturer with some calculations that would work if i hate quality materials. 

Alternatively, does anyone know of a program like autocad where i can make parabolas from a plane surface and factor in wind?

Settle my argument!!!,10,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506568064,True,"Right so, you've got a box in space right? And there is a ball in the box. The box is a vacuum. For convenience I will say the ball is 5m away from every wall within the box. 

Right.

So my claim is, if you had some kind of displacement (we used a rocket in our example) the ball would fall towards the wall of the box that was being impacted; Inertia isn't a thing in space, so the ball is separate from the box. (So if the rocket was pushed against wall #2 the ball would fall towards wall #2).

Sounds good? Good. 

My grandfather's claim is that the ball would stay in a fixed position within the box (it would stay 5m away from every wall within the box). Because there is no force being applied to the ball.

I think I'm right because the displacement of the box doesn't affect the ball until the box makes contact with the ball; when it does, the box takes the ball with it. 

My grandfather thinks I'm wrong because I can't name a force that is explicitly moving the ball. (Even though I totally am talking about the kinetic energy from the box but whatevs.)

Another note,

I supposed a hypothetical situation in which there was a dot painted on the ball; the dot would be pointed towards let's suppose wall #2. If you were to rotate the box, then the dot would still be pointed towards wall #2. But my grandfather also thinks that is wrong!! Do his ideas not contradict each other????? 

Anyways, yeah that's the problem. (We are both totally cool about the dispute and actually want the internet to put this hellhole of an argument to an end.) 

TL;DR. Uhhh, is the ball in a fixed position within the box in space?"

Examples of things I would like to have a more rigorous understanding of are, on the statistical physics side: the definition of the partition function and a derivation of it's relation to entropy, and on the thermodynamical side: the derivation of the entropy function and it's relation to, for instance, the canoncial, micro-canonical, grand-canonical ensemble. And on a more general note: what grounds there are for connecting both theories (like, why the statistical definition of the entropy should equal the thermodynamical one in the thermodynamic limit).

Acceleration of small positive charge between two positive charges,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1506654858,True,"Hi

I have some confusion, from what I understand, like charges should repel with each other.

I come across a statement on electric fields where there are two charges placed between two points (A and B). It says that:

When a small test charge is placed and move from A to B, the acceleration decreases and reached zero then increase in the opposite direction.

I understand the part where the acceleration decreases to zero but then i could not figure out why it increases again. Since the charge B would repel the small positive charge where if the small charge is getting near to B, it should have lower acceleration since the repelling force is getting stronger

[Question][Theory]Comparison of measurement of time in Classical and Special Relativistic Mechanics. Part 1.,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1506836995,True,"I'm having some trouble understanding the construction of reference frames and measurement of time in above two topics. Here it goes:

In Classical Mechanics, an observer A constructs his/her frame by picking up a coordinate system (usually, a 3D Cartesian grid for our assumed 3D world) and a clock. The clock and observer are at rest w.r.t observer's frame. An event ""e"" is described by observer as happening at (x,y,z)eA and at time (t)eA. Another observer B could be, w.r.t A, moving with constant velocity/acceleration/rotating and so his/her frame. B measures an event ""f"" at (x,y,z)fB and (t)fB. Here we say that clocks in all frames are synchronized,i.e., reading same time at any instant. 

Question: Observer A records event ""e"" happening at (x,y,z)eA &amp; (t)eA; as A's clock reads (t)eA, B's clock also reads (t)eA (due to our absolute time assumption). But this is not sufficient to say that (t)eB (time at which event ""e"" occurs acc. to B) also equals what B's clock read at that time, i.e., (t)eA; at some (x,y,z)eB. I mean to say, just by saying that time is synchronized in all frames, we can't say an event which occurred at time t in one frame, also occurred at time t in another frame or can we? 

Galilean transformation equations states that (t)eA = (t)eB, such that a slice of space exists at each instant.

Increasing the thermal conductivity of certain materials by increasing isotopic purity?,3,14,False,False,False,Physics,1506855252,True,"The thermal conductivity of diamond

While not a metal, diamond is an excellent conductor of heat, and **its thermal conductivity can be increased by increasing isotopic purity.**^[1][9] The effect is obviously based on some kind of **crystal resonance**, which is weakened by the 13C atoms randomly scattered between the 12C atoms.

Aluminum and beryllium oxide?

Aluminum oxide^[3] and beryllium oxide^[2] are also excellent conductors of heat. While natural aluminum^[11] and beryllium^[8] are isotopically pure, oxygen is not.^[10] The crystals of these oxides consist of two (chemically) different atoms, not one. But oxygen and the other element are not randomly scattered around - they have a fixed position in the crystal. On the other hand, **18O and 17O are randomly scattered around**, as they randomly occupy oxygen positions, usually occupied by a 16O. Any **possibility of a crystal resonance is reduced** by the randomly scattered 18O and 17O atoms.

If the oxygen in the crystal would be enriched in 16O, then could this increase the thermal conductivity of the material?

Silicon and other semiconductors?

Natural silicon^[5] has three isotopes,^[12] gallium has two,^[14] while phosphorus^[13] and arsenic^[15] are monoisotopic. Silicon and the gallium compounds are not pure when in actual use, but the concentration of dopants is often low,^[16] much lower than the concentration of 29Si, 30Si or 71Ga.

If a semiconductor would only contain 28Si and dopants (or 69Ga, 31P or 75As and dopants), then could this increase the thermal conductivity and make it easier to manage waste heat?

The thermal conductivity of metals

This possibility (proven in the case of diamond[1] ) only applies to non-metallic materials. The position and state of atoms in metals in not as clearly defined as in the crystal structure of a covalent compound, and the usually high thermal conductivity is caused by a different mechanism. The thermal conductivity of the non-monoisotopic copper exceeds that of aluminum[11] or gold, both monoisotopic.^[17]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopically_pure_diamond

&gt;Compared to natural diamonds that are composed of a mixture of 12C and 13C isotopes, isotopically pure diamonds possess improved characteristics such as increased thermal conductivity.[1] Thermal conductivity of isotopically enriched diamonds is at a **minimum when 12C and 13C are in a ratio of 1:1** and reaches a **maximum when the composition is 100% 12C** or 100% 13C.[1]

&gt;The 12C isotopically pure, (or in practice 15-fold enrichment of isotopic number, 12 over 13 for carbon) diamond gives a 50% higher thermal conductivity than the already high value of 900-2000 W/(m·K) for a normal diamond, which contains the natural isotopic mixture of 98.9% 12C and 1.1% 13C. This is useful for heat sinks for the semiconductor industry.[4]

&gt;Small numbers of dopant atoms can change the ability of a semiconductor to conduct electricity. When on the order of one dopant atom is added per 100 million atoms, the doping is said to be low or light. When many more dopant atoms are added, on the order of one per ten thousand atoms, the doping is referred to as heavy or high. This is often shown as n+ for n-type doping or p+ for p-type doping. (See the article on semiconductors for a more detailed description of the doping mechanism.)

Could we live on the inner event horizon of a black hole? (X-post from /r/TheoreticalPhysics),3,5,False,False,False,Physics,1506978543,True,"I am nowhere near qualified to talk about this, but I was doing some reading on Stephen Hawking and currently he is working on the ""Information Paradox"" and had an interesting idea. If my understanding is correct, this is the phenomenon where any information state entering a black hole produces the same sort-of noisy radiation, thus information is ""lost"". Stephen hawking explains that this information is contained within the noise of the radiation.

There are also other theories describing a ""holographic universe"", and a ""chaotic inflationary theory"" that has been recently validated a bit with the discovery of gravitational waves.

On a black hole there seems to be two distinct regions, the event horizon, and the inner event horizon. On the event horizon, time is essentially ""stopped"" where not even light can escape. Within the event horizon, time ""moves toward the center"", where something moving away at the speed of light would move toward the singularity because space itself is moving faster than the speed of light. The second significant region, the inner event horizon, is where the forces from the spinning black hole cancel out this inward force. This is a very unstable region.

I had a thought, what is the process for converting the information entering the black hole to Hawking radiation? Or even just the information reaching the inner event horizon? Something has to happen to convert the very rich information entering the black hole into this chaos and then evenly distributed black body radiation.

What if that process is reality as we know it? If we live on the inner event horizon of a black hole, we could be living those ""instabilities"". The place between the two event horizons is in our future, and the place between the inner event horizon and the singularity is our past. The singularity is the big bang we see.

Dark energy and the expansion of the universe could be a result of the black hole growing/shrinking, depending on which way we perceive time relative to the outer universe. Our perception of time is simply the growth (I'll assume growth, not shrinking for now) or motion of the event horizon, and it could explain why we perceive an exponential expansion of the universe as time passes.

Dark matter could either be information (matter/energy) entering the universe, or information that is about to enter the universe, and the resulting gravity is a result of ""stuff happening"" due to the concentration of information entering the universe. If this were true, dark matter, dark energy, and the passing of time would be deeply connected and really the same thing, growth of the black hole (or shrinking). We see this extra 73% of mass as an un-interacting mass that is different from the mass that we can touch, but what if is an emergent phenomenon from inconsistencies in the information entering the universe. Dark energy, on the other hand, is uniform everywhere and a result of the mass of the black hole expanding, which expands the event horizon and drives the passing of time.

It could explain the ""randomness"" of quantum mechanics and the wave/particle duality, where the current state of the universe is represented as a ""holographic universe"" made of waves on the event horizon, and the new information entering the universe would interact and manipulate this quantum wave state as particles to create the passing of time. I would assume that the actual ""laws of physics"" that we see would be a result of the initial quantum fluctuations during the singularity, see the ""chaotic inflationary theory"". But the randomness the breaks our determinism could be the new information entering the universe.

It could also explain why time seems to be travelling backwards sometimes in quantum mechanics, because our direction of time could be traveling the opposite direction of the containing universe, i.e. if the black hole is expanding. And quantum entanglement could be a result of manipulating a particle before it has completely reached the event horizon, and thus shows up in two places.

If the purpose of reality is to deal with the information entering a black hole, this could explain the 2nd law of thermodynamics, entropy. Why is the universe always trying to create uniform non-redundant noise? It was always strange to me that life exists given this law, and maybe life is a result of a concentration of information entering the black hole at a particular location (this part is pretty out there).

So why is this obviously wrong? Aside from the specifics and speculation I get into, a theory along these lines seems very compelling to me."

To my understanding, one way that Hawking radiation can be explained is by particle\anti-particle pairs forming at the event horizon, the particle flys off, and the anti-particle falls into the black hole and annihilates with mass inside the black hole.  But if this is the case, why wouldn't the 'regular' particle fall in just as often as the anti-particle?  If so, then how could the black hole 'evaporate'?
Furthermore, why doesn't the energy from the particle/anti-particle collision just remain inside the event horizon and the energy contribute to the overall mass/energy of the black hole?

Hey all. I'm a first year astronomy graduate student and I'm struggling with my workload. It's only been just over a month into the semester and I feel like I already feel like I'm behind; for the past week or two I've been just staring at my assignments for hours trying to figure out what to do and rarely am able to answer everything. The better part of my day is just spent trying to solve problems to little/no avail. It seems like it's starting to snowball a bit too; I've been starting assignments later than I like because I try to complete the ones before it, and then either feel rushed or just stare at the assignment as my mind goes blank like the ones that preceded it. There's only one other grad student in the department and he prefers working on his own/doesn't talk much, so I kind of feel on my own with this.

It's starting to wear on me a bit - I'm not sleeping well, I'm scatter-brained, and I never feel like I have the time to actually blow off steam in a healthy way. I love the topic and am really interested in the courses and my research, but I feel like there's a mental block stopping me from being able to use what I've learned.

Is this at all a common feeling when just starting out? I can turn this around and be okay since it's still the beginning, but an obstacle this early on makes me nervous. Any advice or previous experience is welcome and appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Unfunded Canadian Masters degrees,6,1,False,False,False,Physics,1507135683,True,"I truly apologize if this is not a welcome post in r/physics, I'm a bit desperate.

However, now that I have graduated and given both my deep desire to continue on in Physics/Astronomy and the paucity of opportunities for those who stop at the BS, I would like to apply for a Master's degree.

I know that in the States a remedy for my situation would be to apply for an unfunded Masters and prove myself, thereby moving onward to a PHD or at least adding a Masters to my name. However, it seems here in Canada no such unfunded positions exist, all Masters spots are funded and thus highly competitive and strict with their requirements.

Doing an engineering degree with part time physics degree,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1507156670,True,"Hello,
When I started my A levels two years ago, I decided I wanted to be an engineer, since I liked making stuff. Towards the end of the final year, a lot of the knowledge I learned in physics just clicked and I could understand everything, and I was very fascinated/interested in physics. It got to the point where I'm learning from textbooks, and reading up more on the topics I've learned to get a more in-depth view of it.

After a while, I decided to go for a Physics degree instead, but at that time, both my parents were pretty disapproving of it, as it was ""too pure"" and wouldn't get me a job where I live. Because of that pressure, I had to settle for a Mechanical Engineering degree instead, which I guess isn't that bad of a major since they both overlap quite a bit. 

Then sometime a couple of weeks ago, I learned about an online degree that I could do part time at the Open University, which covers a fair amount of knowledge that I'm interested in , which includes topics like QM, Astrophysics and General Relativity, though the last 2 are options to choose from. Most of it is stuff that I find pretty fascinating, though unfortunately for me, there isn't that much nuclear physics going on.

The part time course takes me a minimum of 6 years if I split the modules, but I'm not entirely sure if doing this simultaneously might impact my studies for my engineering degree as I know it'll require a crazy amount of work and time management to get on top of both degrees.

Would it be better to just head straight to physics grad school after my engineering degree or should I go on with this as well? Or should I do a year first of engineering to see if I find the workload manageable then head into that?

30 km/h -&gt; 30/4 = 7.5 -&gt; 7.5 + 0.75 =  8.25 (m/s), while the real answer is 8.(3)

Thought experiment: Would a material that is truly unbendable/unbreakable/uncompressable have infinite inertia?,10,0,False,False,False,Physics,1507229891,True,"So I was thinking about how a really long pole would react with the restriction of the speed of information to the speed of light.  In order to move it at all, you have to move one end while the other stays stationary a few galaxies away until the ""wave"" of information reaches it.

I wondered what would happen if the pole were completely unable to bend.  It would be impossible to budge at all because if one end could move and the other couldn't, it wouldn't really be unbendable.

If it can't move at intergalactic distances, there's no reason I can see that it would be able to move at any distance.  It seems like it would be impossible to affect the material in any way, regardless of the size or shape unless you could apply an even force on every single atom.

I realize this is kind of a dumb idea, because a truly uncompressable material can't exist, but if it holds up, should we see a relationship, however small, between stiffness of a material and the amount of effort it takes to move it?"

Purely in terms of accessing energy from a wave, is it better to harness the energy when a wave is travelling smoothly and not breaking? Or can we obtain more energy from the breaking of a wave as it crashes onto shore?

[Physics Major/Astrophysics research] I have an really interesting TA position and was wondering if it will be beneficial to me,2,6,False,False,False,Physics,1507238634,True,"So I'm a freshman in college( physics major, end goal is to go into grad school for astrophysics) and got lucky enough to land a TA position! Now, alot of people have been telling me that research positions are alot better than TA positions, which makes sense. However, my TA position is for a Solar System Astronomy Lab, which means I get to work with alot of large (and expensive!) Telescopes. I've had some experience with little 60mm telescopes before, but nothing this large (the two major telescopes are 12 inches and 16 inches in diameter, pretty big compared to what I've worked with). Im not sure if there's any other way for someone outside of research to get this much time at my school's observatory, so I really got lucky.

So in this TA position, I get alot of hands on experience with large(ish) observing equipment right on campus. I'm familiar with the area and have had outside school time with some professors who often work with it. 

Like I said, astrophysics is my endgame, and my college has a really good astrophysics program. So I figured, if I'm applying for undergrad research under any of these professors, it might be interesting to say I know how to use this stuff, or have had experience at my school's observatory? Or is it just silly to bring it up. I'm doing this just to get a feel for what astrophysics will be like, which is the main reason I want a research position, so if I hate it then I don't waste years in grad school  

If not for research, then I figured it would add alot to a resume. If I wanted to go on co-op I'd have this, I'm a member of my school's IREC competition, and I'm going to apply to research regardless, because I actually am eager to try my hand at research. So I figure anything helps. What do you all think?


Also, sorry if this isn't exactly the topic for this subreddit. I figured its physics, but just as a major and not as a subject of question. I was going to go to r/askacademia but it felt to specific. If any physics or astrophysics majors could help that'd be great"

"I've been reading. I learned that part of the cosmological principal states that the universe is homogeneous; that it has no centre. It doesn't sit well with me, and here's why.",6,2,False,False,False,Physics,1507247540,True,"Perhaps I'm missing something and you all can help, I'm after all, only an engineer.  This is not my area of expertise. I was reading [this](http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/nocenter.html).
 
Anyway, follow me for a second here, I'm making some (engineer) assumptions. My point of observation is a random point in this universe (doesn't matter where), for my simple mind it's an xyz cartesian area and the singularity that started it all had a position and that is the origin of our system of coordinates (0,0,0). At the time of the bang, everything in my experiment expanded out at some speed (for the sake of this thought experiment, that speed was uniform in all directions outwards from this singularity). 

Firstly, while I understand that we can only measure speeds relative to ourselves and things around us, it occurs to me that:
a) On the line that starts at the origin (centre of the universe), and goes through earth, on one side (the side towards the *outside* of the universe) of that line we would see things travelling away relatively more slowly, and in the other direction (towards the origin), we'd see a mixture of things moving away very quickly, and some things that would be moving away slowly (either side of the origin). I understand how difficult trying to measure this would be, and I don't know how it would be done, I just think that if you somehow could measure the velocities of every star in the universe relative to us, you'd see a stark difference between the relative velocities in either of those directions.
 
Secondly, let's say that we never found a way to measure the relative velocity of all the stars and we couldn't determine a centre based on that method above. I imagine this massive sphere around my location in this universe as the *observable universe.* The edge of the distance that light has had time to travel to us from. If we are not the centre of the universe, one side of this unimaginably large orb around us, in the direction away from the center, would observe things that are *older* than the side that has to go through the origin and then off into the depths of space.  And if (again, ridiculous, I know) somehow you could determine the age of a the atoms that make up a thing by observing it from here and determining the *oldest direction*, you could approximate that the center must be along that line in the opposite direction.  Additionally by somehow determining the difference between the *ages* of the reality you were observing on each end of that line, again approximate where the origin was. 

Thanks for reading... Why am I wrong?

"Has the Speed of Light remained constant over the Universes History and if so, why?",6,2,False,False,False,Physics,1507254014,True,"I recently watched a video on YouTube about how the meter has been redefined to be how far a photon of light travels in 1 / 299,792,458 seconds through a vacuum. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo0jm1PPRuo&amp;t=106s

At 1:40 into the video as he is explaining why the switch from a distance based measurement to a time based and he used the words ""the unchanging constant of the universe"" when referring to the speed of light. 

This bugs me for several reasons and maybe with more indepth information I'll be able to understand why physicists believe this but the problem I see is as follows.

Assuming that the prediction of the age of the universe is somewhere around 13 billion years old why do we assume that the behaviour of light has remained constant throughout the universes history? As I understand it, we have been measuring the speed of light for almost 350 years (and not very accurately until recently) which is an extremely tiny fraction of the universes age and from these observations we extrapolate that the speed is an unchanging constant. Do we have sufficient evidence to believe this? 

Or has it something to do with the speed of light being so intricately bound in so many physics equations (natural laws) that to assume it was possible to fluctuate would make them invalid and we have a large enough body of evidence showing the equations to be accurate?   

Is it possible that if the speed of light were to fluctuate, it would not be possible to observe because a fluctuation in speed would be a result of a overall shift in the 'balance' or dynamics of the universe and that a shift in one fundamental area is a reaction to a shift in the universe as a whole. 

There seems to be two types of thought here. One being that of the objective and the other subjective. 

The idea being should any underlying mechanics change then the equations / patterns / natural laws that are related to this shift in union so that (if it were possible) from an ""objective"" view one could register the shift but because we are part of the system our relative view is also altered and it is impossible to observe? Like how time stays the same the closer you get to denser gravity but to an outside observer the person has slowed down.

In general I have never really agreed with the notion that the phenomena we observe from our time and place in the universe is strong enough to hold firm beliefs that these 'laws' are immutable and universal. It feels like the default assumption about Natural 'laws' is that the universe is having rules imposed upon it from the outside. Maybe this is just my failed interpretation of what I have been taught but the language seems to imply this. 

It seems to me to make more sense that the natural laws / phenomena we observe have evolved from the self organisation of our universe. They can be imagined as a property of the whole which is in turn a generalisation of the collection of smaller parts that make it up and as the internal relations evolve so does the general patterns we experience and label natural laws. 

Could the laws be constructed from a feed back loop where the internal arrangement of the universe evolves the next iteration of itself? Do we have any physicists working on questions like these?

Understanding How Colors Works in Compounds Like Chlorophyll [A Science Trinity Question],3,12,False,False,False,Physics,1507299266,True,"I suppose this is physics based but I am trying to understand how a molecule absorbs a specific amount of light and how it reflects the rest of the spectrum (Its color).

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1507391322,True,"Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.

What I am getting out of this is that we as humans cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time to 100% certainty. While we as humans cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time to 100% uncertainty, these values do exist in nature at any instant of time, right? While we do not (or perhaps cannot) know what these values are, there are numerical values to these variables at any given time, correct?

I've heard arguments about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle disqualifying the hard-deterministic theory that if all particles are simply obeying the laws of physics, everything is pre-determined. I don't see how Heisenberg's uncertainty principle disqualifies this theory as predictable is not the same thing as pre-determined -- if we, as humans, cannot know the position and momentum of any particle at any instant of time with 100% accuracy, we cannot predict the future as human beings. However, if these values still exist as finite numerical values, and assuming they obey the laws of physics, everything can be pre-determined without it being predictable, correct?

"I'm having trouble wrapping my head around ""flavour"". Let's discuss",8,10,False,False,False,Physics,1507400840,True,"So I was high on Wikipedia trying to gain understanding of particle physics. I get really fascinated by fundimental particles so I was reading about quarks. I saw that they come in 6 different flavours.

I'm confused tho, Wikipedia said each of these flavour sates gives the quark a different mass, so why do we say there's 6 flavours of quarks instead of just 6 different particles with different names. What I'm getting at is, if they're different, why do we lump all 6 of them together as ""a quark""

Also, I'm really interested in how the weak nuclear force can make these particles change flavour. Flavour itself is just a property of the unimaginably small quantum wave, so how does this force effect a change in that wave? What ""decides"" which flavour it will change into? Is it truly random?"

Interactive simulation of saturn's rings,3,5,False,False,False,Physics,1507407763,True,"I've been working on a simulation of saturn's rings. It's not yet finished, but I thought I'd put it here anyway for people to play around with:

http://www.articlesbyaphysicist.com/ship1.html

It simulates a 1km x 1km square of the ring, in rotating coordinates. If particles go off the left / right / top / bottom, they appear on the right / left / bottom / top, with offset velocities to mimic the change in frame.

I've put friction in between particles in contact with each other, but not gravity. I think the accuracy of the simulation would depend on getting particle-particle interactions exactly right, and that'll be the limiting factor in this simulation.

But it's certainly fun to play with, and the top-level accuracy is there: the rotating frame, the orbital speed, the rotation of saturn,  the tidal forces from saturn. The particle number density is roughly right, if you make heavy approximations about the shape of the particle.

I'm open to criticism, especially from people actually simulating this. Paper recommendations will get added to the page.

Motorcycles,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1507408586,True,"On a frictionless road and tires, I know the rider wouldn't be able to change the combined center of gravity of the system by moving his weight around. If he pushes the bike to lean to the right, he would go to the left by the amount that would keep the combined cog the same. But a bike with real tires and a real road under it is not a closed system, the tires wouldn't let the lower part of the bike left or right when trying to initiate lean. 


Does this mean it is possible to push with your bodies inertia to the bike, and the combined cog will be changed? 


I think if you apply the horizontal force below the center of mass of the bike, you could, but I am not sure, since the tires will want to move more, but won't be able to, making the combined center of gravity shift more than if you applied the force higher up. 


And I think you should use horizontal forces on the pegs, not up/down forces on the pegs, since it would cause the wheels of the bike to want to rotate the opposite way of the peg rider pushed down on and be opposed by the road.
 So rather than the center of mass being shifted to the way rider leaned to, center of mass of the system would shift to the side where the bike leaned in to. And center of mass of the system would move less than it would, if the rider applied the forces horizontally


I know counter steering is the best way, but I would like to think it is possible to move to center of mass of the system without it, and without the influence of handlebars


Please ignore gyroscopic or camber forces and assume the bike doesn't have any trail in it's geometry (so you would have to ""catch"" the bike manually through the handlebars)

Question about ionic radii size,1,3,False,False,False,Physics,1507486339,True,"The size of a lithium cation is 76 pm, in my chemistry textbook or 90 pm on wikipedia, which is about approximately half or so as small as a neutral lithium atom. Electronically, lithium+ is similar to helium where it has 2 electrons, or a filled 1s shell, so wouldn't one think that lithium+ should have a smaller radii size that helium from the greater coulombic force of the 3 protons of lithium+? However this isn't true since helium has a atomic radii size of roughly 32 pm. Why is it that lithium+ is bigger than helium? 

I asked some people and they said that empirical measurements of ionic radii size is not consistent, for example, in x-ray crystallography, if you chose a certain element as your basis, it can change the measurement of ionic radii size of the thing you're trying to measure. That's why lithium+ has various sizes. But looking at all of the different empirical numbers, lithum+ is still bigger than Helium which I think should be theoretically smaller unless I'm neglecting something. 

The only other thing I can think of to explain this is the difference in principle quantum number of helium and lithium. Helium has n=1 and lithium has n=2, and the principle quantum number, I believe, attributes the average distance of the electrons from the nucleus. If an electron was ionized of off a neutral lithium, it's principal quantum number will still be n=2, but have one less electron. So since it's still n=2, it will be larger than helium which is n=1?

Postponing grad school to learn more?,3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1507503488,True,"I was looking at grad schools on gradschool shopper today and noticed that UC Berkeley has the following as part of their admissions information: 

&gt;Undergraduate preparation assumed: Three semesters-General Physics, Giancoli; 1 semester-Mechanics, Taylor; 2 semesters-Electromagnetism and Optics, Griffiths; 1 semester-Thermal/Statistical, Kittel &amp; Kroemer, Reif; 2 semesters-Atomic Physics and Quantum Mechanics, Griffiths, Bransden &amp; Joachain; 2 semesters-Advanced Undergraduate Laboratory, no required textbook. Plus mathematics courses in vector calculus, linear algebra, ordinary and partial differential equations, complex variable. (Berkeley undergraduates have in addition 1 semester of physics electives; for example, solid state physics, plasma physics, nuclear and particle physics, relativity.)

All of that seems completely reasonable. The only problem is that my university only offers one semester of E&amp;M(Griffiths), one semester of Quantum (Griffiths), one semester of laboratory physics, two semesters of general physics, and no statistical mechanics (we do have an engineering thermodynamics, but one of the physics professors told me not to take it as it wouldn't help me at all in pure physics).

This lead me to consider waiting a year to apply to grad school so I could stay back and finish all of my textbooks. That way I'll have all of the necessary knowledge to do well on the GRE and all of the knowledge that a high level grad school expects its students to have. 

Any thoughts on this idea? Has anyone else done this?"

Help me understand time dilation,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1507558621,True,"Heres my problem. I can't wrap my head around the mechanics of time dilation. I understand an object experiences time slower to an outside observer, while nothing changes for the object.

But how does this work with inertial reference frame? Take the classic ""ship leaves earth %99c for 6 months, turns around and comes back"" problem. For the purposes of helping me understand, ignore all the complicated bits like acceleration, deceleration, factoring in the time the ship needs to reverse direction, etc. Now I understand that more time will pass on the ship, than on earth. That makes sense to me. 

What I can't wrap my head around, is that from an observer on the ship, isn't the ship stationary and its the earth that is accelerating away? And the same for the return trip. Should not therefor the earth, according to the ships perspective, be the one where time passes slowly?

Hopefully I'm explaining myself and someone here in the know can make sense of it. I've done a ton of a reading trying to figure this out, and I just can't quite seem to get my head around it.

Tldr: Two objects of equal size. Object A goes on a near light speed trip and returns to object B. From object B's perspective, object A should be ""older"".

A QM question my student asked me.,6,5,False,False,False,Physics,1507613157,True,"If I have 2 stationary Hydrogen atoms one in the n = 2 state and one in the n = 1 state. It should be possible for the first atom to emit a photon and return to the n = 1 state. Then that photon should be able to be absorbed by the second H atom rising it to the n=2 state. If we consider the momentum of the photon, both H atoms should recoil through this process resulting in the two atoms gaining velocity away from each other. Clearly momentum is conserved but it appears that our system has gained Kinetic energy while the total energy of the H atoms has remained constant, violating conservation of Energy. How can this be?

I argued that because the atom that emitted the photon had recoiled the photon was essentially released from a frame moving relative to the second atom and due to Doppler the photon would not have enough energy to excite the second atom. But I wasn't 100% sure on this. Does anybody have a good explanation for what is happening here?"

Physics PhD in the USA Vs Europe,6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1507624116,True,"I'm starting grad school applications soon, and I'm going through the process of contacting people and looking through schools. 

A lot of the faculty in my own school are products of the American PhD system, and strongly advocate the same, even to the point of being vehement about not applying to Europe. 

The points mentioned against Europe are that:  it's a contract system, where you don't get the same freedom and time to grow like you get doing a full 5 to 6 year program in the US. In Europe, the setting is much more professional and more is expected of you in a shorter, rigidly defined time. Also, 1.5 to 2 years of grad school coursework in the US brings you up to a certain level, and builds a strong base. In Europe, you work in the area of just that one problem, and this remain limited in terms of general prospects. 

I agree that a more gradual and relaxed entry into a graduate research environment might be more beneficial for incoming students who aren't _very_ sure of what exactly to do, so I prefer the US, but it's really hard to find the kind of research I'm doing or want to do, in the US. A lot of that work is happening in Europe. So I'm very conflicted. I'm finding it hard to arrive at departments that are good fits and within my range. 

For context, I'm in theoretical cosmology and simulations, doing a master's in India. Good profile: grades, Research, recommendations, great GRE scores.

I ran into my idea when I was reading on the sun and solar flares, and saw some speculating that studying coronal loops would allow us to better predict solar flares. When I discovered that coronal loops were actually plasma-filled magnetic flux ropes, an idea sprung into my head. So, if I built a magnetron, would it be possible for me to analyze the behavior of plasma in a magnetic field similar to that of the sun? If not, do you guys have any other ideas for something that would be a little more realistic? I'm not really knowledgeable in plasma physics, but I do know all of physics C (Mechanics and E&amp;M).

First of all, as you might have guessed, i am going to write in physics. But my problem is that I have to begin thinking of possible subjects to write about, to experiment with, and so on. and im a bit empty on the idea box ;)  

I know that my physics knowledge is extremely limited at the moment... but i love it! I read ahead, i research outside of school and if its possible - im willing to put in the effort.  
  
With that said i would love to hear some of your suggestions on what would be an exciting, yet manageable subject to pick?   

If its in any interest i love the following subjects in physics - i simply dont know exactly how i should make it into an assignment.  
Radioactivity  
fission and fusion  
Magnetic fields  
Time  
Gravity  

Now i hope i dont make too much of a fool of myself with this post.... These are ofcourse just things i have heard different physicist talk about and they have blown my mind and i would love working with anything within those.  

Thank you very much in advance

Why do my individual measurements not make sense but my linear fit slope does?,9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1507656805,True,"I'm currently doing a lab in a college physics course where I have a pulsed laser thats pointed towards a mirror and then it bounces back to a light sensor. The laser and light sensor are two channels on an oscilloscope and I found the time delay by finding phase difference between the two waves. I measured the distance that the laser traveled and then this divided by the time delay should be the speed of light. I took 7 measurements from varying differences and then plotted this in MATLAB and found a linear best fit line.

What I'm wondering is when I find this best fit line, the slope is 3.006e8 m/s which is very close to the theoretical c. I'm confused because if I were to just take each individual measurement of d/t, I get values that are completely different. My individual velocity measurements are 1.33e8, 1.27e8, 1,15e8, 1.06e8, 0.89e8, 1.35e8 and 1.21e8. These are all very different than c.

How come those values dont make any sense but the best-fit line that I find makes sense?

This is the data from MATLAB:

Linear model Poly1:
     f(x) = p1*x + p2
Coefficients (with 95% confidence bounds):
       p1 =   3.006e+08  (2.342e+08, 3.67e+08)

  R-square: 0.9644
  Adjusted R-square: 0.9572
  RMSE: 0.2825) 

0.2694% error

Also, how do I find the uncertainty for this slope? I know the uncertainty for all of my time and distance measurements but I'm not sure how to figure out the uncertainty for the slope.

(This post will not give any clear answers to anything!)

Since everything is based on ""human"" facts can we only come up with solutions by them. For example: The earth is round. You can see it from a very basic perspective and give it a basic answer by saying: It's round because we did mathematical calculations and got a answer that is related to the laws of physics(*that we came up with*). But if you really look in to it you will never get a clear answer to anything or why it is like that just because every solution we come up with is based on something we humans created(*Math,Sience,etc*). 
That is where religion and belief comes in. How can we say that something is illogical to believe in on how things is, when we are the one who came up with different things to solve stuff and a call it a ""logical solution"". 

(*But religion and belief is also something we came up with so why is that logical?*)

**This post make no sence i know.**

I see it like this. We humans can only solve things that we created. But we can not solve things that existed and was made before us. And how can we know that all we see is not an illusion or ""*something*"" even? 

Example: We can solve a math problem because we created math and the rules to it. Which means we can not solve the mysteries of the unverse if we not use *specific stuff* that we created and sees it as the most logical solution to why it is like that.(*Sketchy explaination i know*)

**(Next part is aimed towards biological stuff)**
So what is existence? Well, when we look at something and can identity it as object that has some form of mass we can say it exist. And this all comes from (*again*) what we humans created. So do anything really exist? And even tho we talk about theories that is outside the law of physics. It is still something we came up with.

**NOTHING EXIST**

Im bad at english and bad on explaining things. That is why i hope someone can explain this is a much better way. And it would be interesting to hear other peoples thoughts on it. So please, go ahead.

Yesterday I was involved in a boating accident involving both my legs. I thought it might be fun to work out how much force they took in the crunch.

I was up the front, the boat is an old big putt putt that weighs about 3.5-4 ton. It got stuck in gear as we were trying to moor it. We were going at around 4 or 5 knots and a jetty was about 30 meters away. I ran up the front and when I realised I wasn't going to stop it I stepped back and sort of fell so I was sitting on a raised bit of this front cabin part of the boat. Then with both my legs over the front, we hit the jetty. Which was a big jetty for big boats, so I would assume you could treat it as an immovable object.

My legs took it all and stopped the boat (worst pain I've ever experienced). 

I'm not looking for an exact number here, just a rough idea. I don't know  if the fact that the boat is on water makes a difference when calculating this, so I was hoping for some help.

If there is no time at that speed, then how can anything continue or revert back? In other words, how can you continue to accelerate to move even faster than light when there is no such thing as 'time' at C?

"How to Simultaneously Diagonalise two commuting hermitian, degenerate, operators.",2,3,False,False,False,Physics,1507770775,True,"I understand that due to the fact that [A,B] = 0, AB|q&gt; = Ab|q&gt; = bA|q&gt; = ab|q&gt;, and that that means that they necessarily share an eigenbasis if A and B are non-degenerate, so you can just find the set of eigenvectors that are solutions to the Eigen equation and compose a matrix M from them, and just sandwich the operators between M^-1 and M to diagonalise them. 

What, then, is the formal method for diagonalising two commuting hermitians when one or both are degenerate?

"Could dark matter and energy be gravity waves?/,",4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1507798984,True,"I'm not a physist, but hear me out and I'll adjust if I'm wrong.  I'll give it up as long as it's not a personal crutch.  Could the universes' historical and current expansion be explained by gravity waves?

Think of the early universe when it was hot, small, and dense.  Dense things can lose energy when they interact with other dense things through gravity waves.  Early on those masses would've been huge and very close together for an almost negligible amount of time.  Could gravity waves exert pressure on space itself?

Maybe gravity caused an almost instant expansion where gravity waves blew the less dense, but still locally gravitationally bound matter into filaments.  That would explain all but the near exact beginning of the early expansion.

The expansion slowed as the density of the universe decreased and there was a period of relative calm.  It became increasingly unlikely that immense bodies would collide and push space too hard with gravity waves.  Can the remaining mass and gravity start all the work with huge fast burning stars?

Maybe now we're experiencing a new expansion of the universe caused by black hole mergers and ordinary interactions that push in every direction.  We are getting pushed in away from everything, while the everything we can see pushes things we can't see.  It would seem thay gravity wave pressure vs gravity rules the day.

That would imply that dark matter and energy are opposite sides of the same coin.  Maybe they could be described as a positive and negative pressure of space.

The Earth and The Moon are pushing gravity waves outward, lately at the expense of Earth's rotational energy.  That would mean that every gravitationally bound object is pushing on space, and we're getting pushed apart in every direction, grouping tighter like filaments from the first explosion.

Could the cosmological constant actually be an equation based on your gravitational wave pressure in all dimentions?  If so it shouldn't be uniform.

Makes sense in a vague manner to me.  I don't think I stole this idea from anyone, it just seemed to make sense after reading and critiquing a Wikipedia article about gravity waves.  If I did steal it I would like the author of the idea to be instantly recognized and down vote my post."

"If the theory of the multiverse is correct, our existence can not be deterministic, nor governed by chance and we must exist as an simulation! (?)",3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1507830304,True,"Argument: The theory of the multiverse states that there's an infite amount of universes and together they contain every infinite configuration of everything. Thus imagine this very moment in time, everything from ""the beginning"" leading up until now, being just as the configuration of our universe. Now, if the statement of the multiverse theory is correct we must then conclude that there is an infite* number of universes with the same ""our start until now"" configuration that start to diverge from our universe at this exact moment.

If this holds true then the universe can not be based upon a deterministic view, as this will impose the idea that there can only be one universe with the given ""our start until now"" and to the end configuration.

And if we're governed by chance at a fundamental level in order for there to be an infite* amount of universes just like ours, but diverge at this moment. Then just chance doesn't take into the account the infinity** of universes where ALL the laws of physics breaks in every combiantion there is. All fundamental building blocks has to have an universe where they are in every place and time and in any combination. Therefore if we exist in a multiverse, existence can not be deterministic, nor governed by chance, as these two will not include the universes that breaks. Only the theory of simulation takes all configurations into concern.

* Not necessarily infite as our universe may only contain an finite amount of energy, but infite=high number of sorts.

Can I make the jump? (Theoretical),4,2,False,False,False,Physics,1507860368,True,"So a friend of mine and I are staring at the building across from us in downtown Denver, CO. I told him I could jump from the balcony we are standing on to the one across the alley way. Now, don't go thinking I'm an idiot and actually want to make it happen. It's extremely obvious: anyone stupid enough to try this would surely die. THIS IS SIMPLY THEORETICAL. We are curious about the human potential to make such a jump and whether or not an athletic person with an infinite running start (lets even say an Olympian) could make this extreme feat happen. Either way, Reddit, we need your help.

We are 26 floors up ( ~12 feet per story so 312 feet), staring at a balcony below us, across the alley way. The balcony we are looking at is 6 stories tall (~72 feet tall). From the building we are in, to the building with the balcony/landing point, we figure it is about 30 feet horizontally. We also figure it is about a 240 foot drop from one balcony to the next. Here is the question...

If one was to get a running start, and leap from the 26th story balcony, is it at all possible to jump 30 feet horizontally, landing on the 6 story balcony across the alley?
Again, there is no need for any advice of why not to do it. Trust me, were not going to try it. This is simply for fun and to prove whether or not one could make it happen.
I, obviously think I could make it happen. My good friend is convinced that I would not make it past the half way point (about 15 feet) whether I was an olympic athlete or not. So, good physicists of Reddit, can you help us solve this dilemma? Could one make such a jump happen?

Let me know if this belongs more in r/math or r/simulated (which seems to be mostly for art)

I'm not very well acquainted with Bessel functions or numerically integrating partial differential equations, but I am wondering how to simulate a circular membrane vibrating under a time-varied forcing function applied to the center of the membrane (or an arbitrary point if possible). 

I work mostly in python, and I found some [code](https://github.com/MaxNoe/python-plotting/blob/master/source/circular_membrane.py) for simulating the normal modes of a vibrating circular membrane clamped along its boundary (corresponding video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asr7QfLksGo&amp;feature=youtu.be)).

I've been searching Google and reading Wikipedia on this stuff, but I can't seem to find much pertaining not to the normal modes but to driven oscillations (e.g. the non-homogeneous part of the equation being cos(2\*pi\*t)). 

How would I go about simulating this? I am open to figuring out how to do some numerical integration on this system, but some pointers would go a long way to let me know if I am on the right track.

I'm currently in my junior year of physics. I've been fortunate enough to have done well in undergrad so far, which hasn't been easy to say the least. Although I have taken upper-level undergrad courses in the past semesters, this semester I feel like I don't have the drive to struggle, and I find myself missing some lectures (mainly because they're so early) and doing homeworks one day before (I've still managed to stay on top of things as of yet). 


I think a big issue is that it takes me quite a while to understand a physics concept, and I'm losing patience because of this. For example, it can easily take me over 2 hours to read 10 pages of Griffiths EM, because each sentence can reference a derivation based on multiple earlier equations/ assumptions. So because of how difficult/time consuming the material is, I would much rather spend the day playing video games than crack open the book or lecture notes. 


I frequently look at my peers who are taking many more classes than me and are somehow keeping up with things, and feel like I'm not cut out for physics/ grad school, although I know this is a negative way of thinking. Speaking of grad school, my PGRE is approaching (next spring), which is adding more stress.

The twitter link is [here](https://twitter.com/skdh/status/918694684263714817), but I'll type out her response too:

&gt; The multiverse [is] an inevitable consequence of abusing mathematics. The purpose of science is to describe observations. If you use insufficiently many assumptions to describe our universe you get ambiguities. These ambiguities you can then call a multiverse. But really it's just that: misunderstanding what science is about. The ""measure problem"" in the multiverse highlights this idiocy. There is no solution to this problem. We already know that! There are infinitely many measures and choosing a measure is a ""weak"" way of choosing a ""place"" in the multiverse. But you could just chose [sic] the place and forget about the multiverse with its measure. It's unnecessary. Occam's razor should eliminate it. The logic that leads to a multiverse in some theories leads to a multiverse in ANY theory. Just remove enough ties to observation! The multiverse isn't science any more. It's mathematical fantasy. And it's utterly fruitless ""research"".

What do you think of this response, and what are your views on the legitimacy of multiverse theory in general? In my own opinion (and please note these topics are well outside of my specific field of research), this response generally reflects my own view of ""fantastical""-type theories. Another example would be theory that the universe is a computer simulation. It seems that there are an unlimited number of similar ""theories"" that could be a consequence of what we know to be true in nature, but in the end are nothing more than untestable speculation. This is sort of echoed in [another piece she recently wrote, criticizing inflationary theory](http://backreaction.blogspot.ca/2017/10/is-inflationary-universe-scientific.html):

&gt; ""...it is therefore utterly pointless to twiddle with the details of inflation because there are literally infinitely many models one can think up""

some of you might be familiar with the Walter Lewin MIT videos on Youtube. In one of the episodes he makes the statement that wider tires on cars are not being used for better traction, since the weight of the car (let‘s say 3.000 lbs) is distributed onto a larger surface area of rubber compared to a smaller tyre, negating the advantage of a wider tire, since the weight per square inch of rubber is less. He then asks the students to think about the reason why they are being used nonetheless as a homework for the next lecture.

Unfourtunately, the question is not being answered in the next episode. Now ever since I saw that video several months ago, I‘ve been asking myself what that reason might be. Maybe someone around here can answer that question and tell us what Walter Lewin had in mind?

I was instructed to determine the magnetic field *B* at a point *P* from two parallel wires (a distance *R* from the point, with the wires being a distance *d* apart from one another) with anti-parallel currents. Naturally, I've attempted to set up the problem, attempting cross-products, reverse trig (since an angle was not provided), etc.. I've been told that some components of the B-field cancel out, others don't, and when I stumbled across the solution from a classmate, I was baffled as to how it related to the Biot-Savart Law; the solution for the problem is given below:

B=(d*I*μ)/(2π(R^(2)+(d/2)^(2))

where I is the current and mu is the magnetic constant. π is pi. 

I've been taught that the Biot-Savart law was as follows (in differential form):

dB=(μ/4π)((Idl x r)/r^(3))

Where dl x r is the cross-product of the differential length with a radius r. 

Can someone please explain to me how this is related back to Biot-Savart? No matter what I seem to do, I cannot obtain the correct equation above despite my efforts of cross-products, integration, and essentially anything else. I can provide a photo of the problem if necessary.

Keep in mind that I have obtained the correct answer to the problem, but I am having trouble understanding it and that is why I am posting here. If someone could explain why the provided equation is related to Biot-Savart, it would help me understand magnetism greatly.

[question] What makes quantum entanglement so special?,18,0,False,False,False,Physics,1508155704,True,"I don't understand quantum entanglement. If I spun a BeyBlade in space, and another upside down relative to that, and I asked someone to tell me which one is spinning upside-down, they wouldn't know until they observed it, and when they did, they would obviously know what spin the other had. Just because we haven't measured them doesn't mean that they are literally spinning both ways... it just means that we haven't measured one yet.

Any ideas for a neat computational physics project?,10,2,False,False,False,Physics,1508168111,True,"Hey there, so I'm in a computational physics course and we have to do a term project where we basically use a computer to solve some non-trivial physics problem and we're basically allowed to do anything we want. I'm not super experienced in numerical methods but I feel like this is a good opportunity for me to do something interesting but I'm having trouble deciding on a project.

I was wondering if any of you had suggestions for a computational problem that would (ideally) take a couple of weeks, be interesting and approachable and result in some nice looking visualizations. 

At first I thought it'd be easy for me to find such a problem but I'm actually finding it hard to decide so any inspiration you could lend me would be much appreciated!

I'm a masters student in condensed matter theory so it'd be nice if it were condensed matter project but I'm really not very prejudiced against other problems so any field is okay.

Incidentally, I'm really interested in topological data analysis and would love to do my project using persistent homology but can't find a single physics problem that this would be useful for so if any of you know about persistent homology and a somewhat doable project that could use it then I'd be super interested to hear about that!"

Maximum energy density?,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1508179019,True,"Ok, so this question pretty much has no practical real-world application and is mainly theoretical. Anyway, what is the maximum density you can store energy in that is non-volatile. As an example of volatile, you can have a black-hole (possibly infinite energy, but we don't know enough about them yet). Anything that will kill you by holding it counts as volatile. Originally, I was thinking of something like this:  
You suspend a single particle with within a very small vacuum flask. You can give as much kinetic (thermal) energy to that particle and it will never actually reach a maximum energy level. I then realised that by doing this, the particle would eventually reach a state where its fixed-point vibrations are enough to reach the outer edges of its container, thus applying its kinetic energy to the edges of its container and probably exploding in a way that counts as volatile.

Anyway, thanks in advance for your responses. I know it might not count as practical physics but I don't really know whether there's a better subreddit for it. I look forwards to your replies!"

How can we know what is happening at sub-atomic level during collisions in an accelerator?,12,9,False,False,False,Physics,1508183096,True,"Hi there, I have a Phd in pure math but have always been interested in physics, even got as far as undergrad quantum mechanics, so don't feel like you need to water things down too much.


I occasionally find myself reading articles about things which have been discovered at the Hadron collider, and I am often left with the burning question ""how the hell did they figure out that is what happened?""

Because they usually talk about the collision producing a bunch of different things with half-lives that only last a fraction of a millisecond or something and it just seems totally impossible that they actually have a way of detecting things at that level.

To be a bit more specific, neutrinos are often emitted from this type of reaction (I think) and I know for a fact that it is pretty much impossible to detect neutrinos even when they rain down on us billions at a time let alone a single one released from an isolated reaction.


Another more specific example (though I don't know if this is done at a collider or somewhere else) is the phrase ""a quark can not exist by itself, if you try to isolate one you end up with 2 protons"".  Like how can we tell that there are 2 now when we can't directly measure the exact number of protons?


Thanks in advance from a mathematician with virtually no experimental experience lol 


EDIT:  Yes I realize that a millisecond is a fairly large unit of time in such instances I was simply too lazy to look up what the actual number was because it seemed irrelevant, my point was merely an arbitrary ""small unit of time"".  But in my defense  1 trillionth of a millisecond is still a ""fraction of a millisecond"".  I was much more concerned with the detection of the particles themselves then with measuring the time that they existed before decaying :-)

[Question] Is this research idea doable?,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1508244415,True,"Hello r/physics! I'm currently a junior in high school, and I have the whole year and a decent amount of funding for my own research project. I'm not here to ask for ideas - rather, I want to know if my idea is realistic to do and learn during a year, or to know a similar one that would.
I ran into my idea when I was reading on the sun and solar flares, and saw some speculating that studying coronal loops would allow us to better predict solar flares. When I discovered that coronal loops were actually plasma-filled magnetic flux ropes, an idea sprung into my head. So, if I built a magnetron, would it be possible for me to analyze the behavior of plasma in a magnetic field similar to that of the sun? If not, do you guys have any other ideas for something that would be a little more realistic? I'm not really knowledgeable in plasma physics, but I do know all of physics C (Mechanics and E&amp;M). I just want to do some research into some aspect of space, and something relating to the sun or solar flares seems really interesting. So do you guys think my idea is doable, or do you guys know something else I could do that might be a little more realistic? I'd appreciate any feedback you guys could give me, I'm still in my planning stage. Thanks!"

Struggling with Physics,10,12,False,False,False,Physics,1508283677,True,"Firstly I am from the UK and already have a Bsc in Physics (1st class honours)
I didn't know what to do after graduating and I just felt like physics is the only thing I know (oh how wrong I was) and wanted to learn more about it, to learn the advanced stuff that wasn't covered in-depth in a undergrad degree. 

So I'm currently on a 1 year theoretical physics Msc (if youre from the US its probably the same as 1st and 2nd year of grad school) designed to prepare me for a phd afterwards and I'm struggling really badly. We cover the material so quickly compared to my undergrad degree and the only way I can keep up is by spending the rest of my free time going over it and reading textbooks. I have to get up early and go to sleep early and I feel exhausted, and I'm slowly falling behind. I'm not even worried about failing, I know I could do well if I wanted to its just it means literally having no life for the next year in order to succeed, I guess I'm not smart enough and the only way I can keep up with everyone else is giving up all my free time.

The worst part is I thought I loved physics and maths and have no idea what I would do instead.  I don't want to drop out because its a waste of a lot of money in tuition fees and I'd dissapoint my parents so much - everyone I've spoken to about this including my parents just says 'oh they accepted you for the course for a reason you will be fine' or they just don't comprehend how hard I'm finding it and that I should be smart enough to do it.

In my undergrad I did well and had a lot of free time relative to this.

I feel pretty depressed, mostly about being inferior to all the people who seem to be managing fine and doing well.  Does anyone have any advice or have had a similar experience? 

Sorry if this isn't the best board for this, I wasn't too sure.

Tldr: physics is kicking my ass"

Getting into Physics at 22,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1508289201,True,"I'm 22 and I want to go to university to do physics. Hitch is, I have no A-levels due to having to drop out of high school due to personal circumstances. For the past 5 years I've been working and raising a family.

I've looked around and I'm not sure if there is an access to Physics HE route, which means I'd have to redo A-levels which may cost me an arm and a leg not to mention taking one more year than an the access route.

Supporting my family isn't an issue, and if I get to the point when I'm at university it won't be an issue. The main problem is having not done anything at all concerning applying to uni or access courses because I haven't needed to. And not knowing anything about the routes possible means that I am worried I'll choose a route that isn't suited to my circumstances.

I would understand if the ship was very long or big and part of the ship was stuck in the gravitational pull and the rest was outside, so when the ship detached from itself it would benefit from the gained speed of slingshotting around gargantua (but the landers and the endurance in the movie just aren't big enough for that to happen)"

Question: Double-slit experiment kit with detector?,1,3,False,False,False,Physics,1508422867,True,"Hi there folks,
first of all excuses for my lack of knowledge. I'm not a physicist and don't have too much understanding, however I find the implications of the classic double slit experiment fascinating.

As I understand it, in its simplest form it could be understood like this (pls correct me if I'm wrong):

1) Run experiment, no detectors, control pattern result: wave pattern.

2) Run experiment, detectors switched on, control detector results, control pattern result: particle pattern

2.1) Run experiment, detectors switched on, ERASE detector results, control pattern result: wave pattern

2.2) Run experiment, detectors switched on, PRINT detector results, control pattern result: particle pattern

2.3) Run experiment, detectors switched on, PRINT detector results, burn detector results, control pattern result: wave pattern

=&gt; does that sound about right?

It would be amazing if those procedures could be tried out at home. Is there any chance the tools needed are small/ affordable enough to build / purchase a do-at-home kit?

Thanks in advance!"
Almost done with my physics degree and I have no idea what to do with my life,8,10,False,False,False,Physics,1508423168,True,"Pretty much as the title says. I dunno what I want to do with my life. Or what I *can* do. And not knowing that has kinda left me unmotivated to do any of my work. I still usually get it done, only about last minute though, but I do it. I feel like I'd be more motivated if I actually have goals but I don't. I'm a junior and don't even know if I want to go to grad school or not. Why? Because I haven't done any research yet. I've tried working with a professor this semester but the ones I've emailed have either not responded or are working with people or have too many PhD students to be able to handle undergrads at the moment. 

So right now I'm unmotivated. And classes are boring. Though I've heard from some that they find research more interesting, but I haven't done any yet. So, the classes feeling boring makes me feel like maybe grad school isn't for me, but I feel like I can't truly decide until I get some research under my belt but out of the several people I've talked to none of them are able to take me? So I just kind of feel stuck and am not sure what to do. Maybe I'll change my mind after doing research, maybe I won't. And then if I decide grad school isn't for me, I'm not really sure what I can do with an undergrad degree either. Idk sorry for this kinda ranty post just seeking some sort of advice I guess.

For instance, I did not bring a ""cheat sheet"" to the final exam in Physics 2 even though they were allowed while many of my classmates had double side sheets with font so small you would need a magnifying glass to read anything. I honestly did not think that it would help me, and it turned out that it was, in fact, unnecessary because afterward, my professor told me that I obtained one of the highest scores on the exam. 


Also, the fact that knowledge and intuition I acquired would be useful in a wide variety of fields was also very appealing. I had also considered a variety of engineering fields but never got on board. In hindsight, maybe this was just fear of specialization?


As a current undergraduate physics student, I cannot help but feel that egotism played a role in my decision to major in physics, since I am more interested in technology than in science."

I am about to finish up my B.S. in computer science, but I have always been interested in physics. I constantly watch physics documentaries (No, not just Neil deGrasse Tyson). I read up on the subject. I have a passion for problem solving. Going into university, I was torn between computer-science/engineering and physics. I am a practical and logical individual, so I chose computer science over physics based on the fact that the CS field has more job openings. But, sometime last month, I realized I can't shake my interest in physics... I decided I want to study physics at university and end up working in the physics industry eventually. I know the computer skills and problem solving skills I learned through my CS curriculum can prove useful in physics.

Considering my class schedule is full, my current plan is to finish my computer science degree (May 2018), and then, start the physics curriculum (it would take me less than 2 years to get the B.S. in physics, as a fair bit of the engineering &amp; C.S. classes I took are part of the physics curriculum as well). Also, money is not an issue.

My question is: Is this a good plan to stick to? Or should I work for a few years in the computer science industry, and then come back to get my physics education?

Advice for University Study,9,1,False,False,False,Physics,1508474511,True,"First of all, thanks for taking the time to come to this post.

Background information about myself:

* Senior in High school (Graduation 2018)

* Top 1% of my graduating class

* Taking STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) courses at a local university campus, along with a few other selected students in my county (Junior and Senior Years of High school)

STEM classes to be completed by the end of this year:

* All math up to and including Calculus III (Multi-variable) and Linear Algebra (No AP Equivalent, Junior Year: AP Calculus BC) 

* 4 semesters of Physics: Algebra based Physics I &amp; II, Calculus based Physics I &amp; II (AP Physics 1/2 and AP Physics C: Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, respectively)

* 2 (beginner level) semesters of Computer Science:  Java (AP Computer Science A) 

	* I’m learning Python independently

	* I currently run a Computer Science club at school and enjoy app development and competitive coding

* 4 semesters of Chemistry research 

* 2 semesters of Engineering Research and Innovations

I realize that I’m at a pace far ahead of the usual Senior in high school, and please note that I’m ever so fortunate to have been given that opportunity. With that being said, I was wondering whether it would be more practical to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science/Engineering and become a programmer, or pursue a degree for my side passion of Astrophysics/Cosmology. I greatly enjoy both Astrophysics and Computer Science, and spend plenty of my free time researching and furthering my knowledge in the fields of both. 

As given by my classes, I have the necessary math and physics (at least I think so) knowledge to pursue Astrophysics. My fears, however, are: A) whether I’ll be able to find a sufficient job after I graduate, and B) a possible difficulty in curriculum due my lack of background astronomy knowledge (I’ve only learned Astronomy independently, as a passion). I know that there is a much greater chance of “guaranteed success” if I major in Computer Science, as there exists a much greater demand for programmers than astrophysicists. 

So what should I major in?
 
With that bulk of information, I’m sure I was unclear somewhere. Please feel free to ask any questions for clarity. Any advice or possible resources to research are appreciated!

Nonetheless, some questions remain tied to the position basis. Specifically, why in position basis is the momentum operator negative i h-bar times del (or the partial derivative with respect to x, in one dimension). Why, both on a formally and intuitively, is this the case?

Conservation of momentum motorcycles,3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1508523174,True,"On a frictionless road and tires, I know the rider wouldn't be able to change the combined center of gravity of the system by moving his weight around. If he pushes the bike to lean to the right, he would go to the left by the amount that would keep the combined cog the same. But a bike with real tires and a real road under it is not a closed system, the tires wouldn't let the lower part of the bike left or right when trying to initiate lean. 


Does this mean it is possible to push with your bodies inertia to the bike, and the combined cog will be changed? 


I think if you apply the horizontal force below the center of mass of the bike, you could, but I am not sure, since the tires will want to move more, but won't be able to, making the combined center of gravity shift more than if you applied the force higher up. 


And I think you should use horizontal forces on the pegs, not up/down forces on the pegs, since it would cause the wheels of the bike to want to rotate the opposite way of the peg rider pushed down on and be opposed by the road.
 So rather than the center of mass being shifted to the way rider leaned to, center of mass of the system would shift to the side where the bike leaned in to. And center of mass of the system would move less than it would, if the rider applied the forces horizontally


I know counter steering is the best way, but I would like to think it is possible to move to center of mass of the system without it, and without the influence of handlebars


Please ignore gyroscopic or camber forces and assume the bike doesn't have any trail in it's geometry (so you would have to ""catch"" the bike manually through the handlebars)

Help looking at CERN data to prove a Higgs Boson actually occurred.,6,8,False,False,False,Physics,1508525501,True,"Alright, so I haven't even taken quantum physics yet, but my professor's emphasis is on particle physics so he likes to incorporate that into lectures / labs.  I have a lab on this:

---------------

Use [this data](https://imgur.com/a/zHmLr) collected from [CERN open data.](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/300)

----------------

**This is the prompt:**

Download the files '4lepton.csv' and 'diphoton.csv' containing 4 lepton and 2 photon events identified as Higgs boson candidates by CMS leading to the discovery of this last missing standard model particle. Because the Higgs mass does not exceed twice the Z-boson mass, a real Higgs cannot decay to two real Z-bosons. It can however decay to one real Z and one virtual Z, rarely. Examine the masses of various lepton pairs to find the pairing most consistent with pairs originating from Z bosons in the direct decay H=&gt;ZZ* with Z* a somewhat virtual Z. The Z-boson invariant mass has a measurable natural width (see PDGLive for the value) so one boson should be within that range. Because m_h&lt;&lt;2m_Zmh&lt;&lt;2mZ, energy conservation dictates one Z boson is likely highly virtual. The coupling strength (equivalent to charge) of the Higgs to a particle is proportional to its mass in the standard model and the probability of Higgs decay to particle plus antiparticle proportional to the square of the particle mass. It follows that the Higgs prefers to decay to the heaviest particles, to a LaTeX: b\bar bbb¯ pair in fact. It cannot decay to a pair of Z-bosons but can decay to a real Z plus one virtual Z with suppressed probability since one is ""off shell.""

---------

Now, I would have a specific question, but really I have no idea what any of this means, and my professor isn't helping (or my TA).  Any insight on what any of this means would help.  If someone could tell me which data columns I need to look at, that would be great.  I assume it is looking at M to see if it is close to 125GeV, but other than that, I am dumbstruck.  

----------------

**A few specific questions:**

Like, if Z is supposed to be larger than H (which it is), then why are the energies for the 4 leptons greater than the energy from two Z bosons?  Do I need to look at particle width?  What would I do with particle width?  What is love?"

The way we understand and communicate Speed seems incomplete to me. What am I missing here?,12,3,False,False,False,Physics,1508530326,True,"-Update-  

My question has been answered.  Thank you to everybody who commented below!  You made this very easy for me to understand.  


-------------------------------------------------------
Speed= Distance/Time


This seems to be somewhat lacking to me.  And to be clear, my only real interactions with scientific terms is just in casual conversation and high school science classrooms, so that is the context I'm coming from.

The problem in this definition of speed for me, is it seems to assume that things travel in constant motion over a certain amount of distance.  Or at least it seems to in the way the word is used, both conversationally and in Science classrooms.

So professor will say for example, that we can conclude the speed something was traveling by how far it moves in a certain amount of time.  If a dog covered ten miles in an hour, then it was running ten miles an hour we can conclude.  But was the dog ever actually running 10mph?

If a dog covers 10 miles in one hour, sure it’s average was 10 miles per hour, but it may not have ever (except for brief moments during acceleration and deceleration) have actually been running at 10mph.  It was likely combinations of higher and lower speeds that averaged 10 miles over the course of an hour.  But the communication to me seems very implicit that we are talking a constant velocity.  Perhaps this is really more of a language problem? 

And this seems like a pretty important discretion to make isn’t it?  If scientists are trying to communicate with each other and say “This rocket’s max speed is 800 miles per hour” wouldn’t it be important that distinction is made in our understanding of the word?  Because technically that rocket could still be capable of a temporary velocity higher than 800 mph, couldn’t it?  As long as its average speed over the course of an hour didn’t exceed 800.  

Is the problem that we just use the words velocity and speed incorrectly in everyday language?  Should we think of Speed more as an average and velocity for communicating rate of movement at a given moment of time? 

If somebody tells me that the speed of something is 10mph, I get a very specific image in my mind of an object moving at a constant rate that covers 10 miles in an hour, not a combination of speeds that averages 10 miles in an hour.  I think this is true for 99 percent of people.  Is the problem that the conventional use of the word “speed” should actually be replaced with the word “velocity” to better reflect what people mean?

If you’re sitting in the passenger seat and ask the driver “What is your speed?”-- presumably you would mean what is your rate of moment I assume that the more accurate question would be “what is your velocity?” (Which obviously sounds really bizarre to the ear).  But is this the correct way to think about it?  Because if he says is speed is ""60mph"" that probably wouldn't be true technically.  Over the course of an hour he wouldn't driving 60mph the entire time, considering that he really has to stop and change to lower speeds constantly.  


Any help in better understanding these terms would be greatly appreciated!

First time posting here, so maybe it's wrong. Just a funny question. Maybe you can help me understand what happened. 

Background: So basically, im a GIS/RS guy and for a UAV work I had to create  markers (for georeferencing) which would maintain in the same spot for UAV flights in different season.

For this I used wooden plaques which were fixed on the ground using construction irons. This made them very inconspicuous for people who passed by and because I had georeferenced them, I could easily find them and use them co-referencing UAV images. So far, so good. 

But... maybe you've been seeing all these fires in Portugal. My study area got totally burned down. But, the ""fun"" part, is that almost all my targets were lifted from the ground. Often in the same place as they had been put but, just lifted. Only one showed signs of burning.

Here's a rough sketch:
https://scontent-mad1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22687762_10155119304172201_152297253222486348_n.jpg?oh=e0c1a7f95084338a13b972e7f5dcc6b9&amp;oe=5A80FB49

So, what could have possibly have happened? 

Could the hot air have lifted the targets? Or maybe water vapor (because most were not burned)?

I have a picture of one of them lifted from the ground if you want to see, I can drop it in here.

I'm having trouble understanding a few aspects of Avagadro's constant and moles. Any help is appreciated!,13,1,False,False,False,Physics,1508549081,True,"I’m trying to better understand Moles and Avagadros’s number.  Here are the questions I can’t seem to get past:

1.  I don’t entirely understand the point of Avagadros number.  I get that it is a proportionality constant for scaling up elements and compounds, right?  Though I don’t really see what the point of scaling them up is.  What is the point of scaling these elements and compounds up with such a strange number?  Why not just work conceptually with the ideas of single molecules and atoms?  Or is the purpose really more for physical reasons to give us qualities of things that are workable in the real word since we can’t easily manipulate individual molecules and atoms?


2. Why is Avagadros number so strange?  Would it not make more sense to make the number something rounder and easier to conceptualize?  Does that number actually have some sort of inherent significance that makes it indisputably the best number for scaling these particles up or do we use it more just because it is traditionally how chemistry is done?

In short, does the exact value for Avagadro's number have some inherent benefit that makes it the best number for the conversion?  Is there not a number that modern scientists could come up with that would work even better? "

I have a few questions about a thermodynamics experiment,10,0,False,False,False,Physics,1508554364,True,"There is a famous experiment I learned about in high school that was performed by an early physicist (though I don't remember who the physicist was).  In the experiment, things are burned in a sealed container, and it still weighs the same amount after everything is burned up. The purpose of this experiment is to show that the matter is only changed and nothing is actually being destroyed.


But isn’t this breaking a law of thermodynamics? I understand that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. So wouldn’t all that energy you are creating by, say, burning a sealed container of gasoline, cost some matter to get all that energy? Shouldn’t you have to lose mass to balance out all that heat energy you created? Anytime energy is created some mass has to be lost right? 


And I have a really hard time believing that if I somehow burned a gallon of gasoline in a sealed container that it would weigh the same amount at the end. A gallon of gasoline weighs 6.3 pounds. What would be in there at the end that weighs 6.3 lbs after burning all of it?"

Crash test physics question,3,2,False,False,False,Physics,1508596213,True,"Hello! So I have a random question about how crash tests are conducted that's been bugging me for a while. I know very little about physics and am pretty horrible at math and engineering, so I figured I'd ask people who know way more than I do!

The IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) created the small overlap test in 2012, which replicates what happens when a vehicle's front corner collides with another object. In this test, vehicles are positioned so that only 25% of the front end impacts the barrier. Before then, frontal crash safety was rated based on full-width impact and 40% offset tests.

It was an important addition, as single-vehicle crashes (when they strike poles, trees, etc.) account for 40% of small overlap crashes and 25% of frontal crash deaths are due to this kind of collusion. From a physics perspective, it's obviously very difficult to engineer a vehicle frame that can handle these forces but there are now many cars that receive a ""good"" rating from IIHS.

But in this test, vehicles in the ""good"" category tend to fall into one of two categories: 

One group of vehicles' structures takes the full brunt of the barrier, and they stop from 40 to 0 MPH while against it and then rotate. An example is the 2018 Toyota Camry https://youtu.be/fEcSdtE4DhE

Alternatively, other vehicles rated as ""good"" have structures that push the car away from the barrier and they continue to slide forward. An example is the 2017 BMW i3 
https://youtu.be/l6BKlWD24YQ 

How can the Camry and i3 both receive ""good"" in this test? I don't understand how the i3's results demonstrate a comparable level of safety. What am I missing or not considering? I've written IIHS directly and received no response and also asked a popular automotive journalist, who responded on his show but didn't seem to understand my question.

I assume a simple fix would be to position a wall along the opposite side of the car to hold it in place, forcing it against the barrier in front."

The radius of the pipe. The flow rate of the liquid and the length of the pipe in which the fluid is flowing + molecular weight (Which gives us the total weight of the moving liquid)."

Can someone explain the tensor product to me?,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1508644348,True,[removed]
What is the definition of energy in Quantum Mechanics/ Quantum Field Theory?,6,9,False,False,False,Physics,1508645296,True,"The reason I ask this is because I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4n84bd/what_is_energy/) subreddit on askscience asking what energy was. The most upvoted comment described energy in terms of relativity and spacetime through the following quote 

""Noether's version of energy generalizes nicely beyond Newtonian mechanics, so you can extend the definition of energy to electromagnetic fields (it turns out electric and magnetic fields store energy) and relativistic mechanics (from whence we get E2 = m2c4 + p2c2).
The full relativistic generalization leads nicely to the most modern view: energy is (a certain part of) the thing that bends spacetime. Just like we can think of electric charge as 'the thing that produces electric fields,' we can think of energy as 'the thing that bends spacetime.' More technically, energy is but one part of the stress-energy tensor, which provides the source of spacetime curvature. Indeed, in modern physics, even when ignoring the effects of gravity, you can answer the question 'how much energy is here' by asking how spacetime would bend if it could. Whatever stress-energy tensor you get out of the calculation will be conserved and equivalent to the first two definitions of energy. (Weirdly, this way of finding the conserved energy can be easier than finding it directly.)""
 
So we define energy as what is bending spacetime. However with quantum mechanics we know spacetime is only an approximation and not really fundamental. I remember watching many lectures of prominent physicists like Sean Carroll saying space is obviously not fundamental and we can do QM without the concept of space. Also theoretical particle physicists Nima Arkani-Hamed from Princeton has been giving lectures the past decade on how spacetime is not fundamental and ""doomed"". So to restate my question, how does quantum mechanics/Quantum Field Theory/QED, the most fundamental sciences that deal with the most fundamental parts of reality, define what energy is without spacetime?"

How Thermodynamics Will Destroy the Universe (Video),0,4,False,False,False,Physics,1508775089,False,
Question about particle/anti-particle asymmetry,9,2,False,False,False,Physics,1508782002,True,"I've seen a lot of people reasoning that there must be some asymmetry between particles and anti-particles because there are many more particles then anti-particles, and because it is believed that initially there were an equal number of both.

I'm not sure that holds though. Consider a fair coin that is flipped N times. It's a well known result that if we code heads as 1 and tails as -1 and sum the flips into X, the expected absolute value of X approaches infinity as N approaches infinity- informally, when there are lots of tosses either heads or tails predominates by a lot (though not in terms of proportion, only the absolute number)

If particle/anti-particle interactions are analogous to fair coin tosses, that would imply that if there were a large enough number of pairs to start with, then even if they were wholly symmetric you would likely have an enormous number of either one or the other left over at the end.

What's wrong with that reasoning? Why does there have to be an asymmetry?"

Why finish my degree when my senior seminar project organizers are setting me up for failure?,13,18,False,False,False,Physics,1508819257,True,"I'm currently in my senior year of college, but considering staying for another year to fix my GPA in classes that I took when my lungs were collapsing/I was experiencing the beginnings of adult onset epilepsy (lots of seizures).

Graduation at my school requires physics majors to take part in a professor's research project, and complete a subset of it while doing various sub-tasks for the class, such as presentations, reports, and grant proposals. I am doing great on the research itself, but the requirements for the sub-tasks have been consistently vague while grades have been harsh on the non-communicated requirements. The guy leading the seminar part (not the professor doing the research) doesn't necessarily have a *grudge* against me, but it does seem like he is more focused on grading harshly than imparting useful knowledge. I'm trying really hard, and my professor is giving me good feedback, so I don't feel like I'm screwing up, but my grade is dictated by the one leading the seminar part, and thus isn't doing very well. I have no idea what to do to improve it, and recently I missed a meeting that was announced last-minute, because I couldn't get work off that fast, and so that's 10% of my final grade gone.

This has all led to me being extremely depressed and given me a feeling of complete helplessness. I'm going to start documenting individual cases of him doing bad stuff, and maybe report it at the end of the year, but I don't have much hope that it will do anything. It's crushing my interest in physics research and making me want to just leave. There are other career paths for me but...I'm so freaking close to graduation. I don't want to miss that sheet of paper just because of this guy's nonsense.

Contemplating myself about dropping physics major...,35,40,False,False,False,Physics,1508827423,True,"Hello, I am pursuing physics BS as a freshman but really it is not actual major since my college does not declare major before junior year so I am like 'pre-major.' Anyway, here is my story...

To be honest, I did not like physics at all from the first place. I loved astronomy though. All those mesmerizing stuffs about the Solar System, the expansion of the Universe, star formation, galaxies, etc. just surprised me and they were all so beautiful to me. I loved these topics from when I was in kindergarten and I thought “I’m gonna be an astronomer when I grow up!” Now I am a 19-year-old boy studying college, wandering around.

I really liked reading, learning, and talking about astronomy. However, as I knew more and more about astronomy, I realized astronomy is pretty much nothing without physics. Whenever I read some astronomy books, the books would whisper “Dude, you need to be friends with physics in order for you to be friends with me.” So I just read some books about physics and learned physics. Now I know how to do some basic physics. It is impossible to do physics without mathematics. So I also learned mathematics and I know how to do some basic math as well (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations).

There were no ‘astrophysics’ or ‘astronomy’ majors in my college so I just decided to become a physics major. I am taking Classical Mechanics I and Classical Mechanics I Lab right now as required courses for Physics BS. However, those physics is different from what I’ve done so far. It is much more delicate and difficult. But I am getting average grade in Classical Mechanics I somehow (I am getting failing grade in Classical Mechanics I Lab though.) and I feel like I am not doing well as a physics student. I also feel like I do not have ‘fun’ while I am solving for problem sets or writing lab report. They take a lot of effort and time and it would be ideal if I felt, even the slightest, that I was having fun while doing them but really, no. I am not having fun. I guess I learned how ‘Learning Physics’ and ‘Doing Physics’ are two different things.

I wanted to be a professor. You need to go to a good grad school to be a professor, right? In order to do so, you need good grades in physics classes and have a good understandings on the topics but I feel like I am not. I feel like I am studying physics just because it is a ‘stepping stone’ towards astronomy/astrophysics and I actually don’t enjoy physics but I am just doing it just for the sake of astronomy.

I will have to study as a student for more than 10 years, given that I will go to a grad school. Would this be worth it? I will start earning money later than my peers who do not end up in grad school and I am not sure if I would enjoy that. I am not sure if this is the thing that I would love SO MUCH to do to the point where I can endure that. Do I want a job right after I graduate college? Or do I want to research and be a professor? Just with a Physics BS, you cannot really get any significant job; a lot of Physics BS students go ahead to grad school to pursue a PhD.

And then I just ask to myself one more time… “Do you still love astronomy?” Then somewhere deep down in my heart, one small response comes back… “Uh... Yes.” I ask again, ""Do you love enough to just do this instead of getting a job after college?"" Then no response comes back.

Some of you guys might think I am dumb. Because astronomy is pretty much a subset of physics. A lot of stuff that I learn as a physics major (Quantum Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Classical Mechanics, Relativity, etc.) will be used holistically in astrophysics and I say I don’t like Classical Mechanics? What an idiot!

I asked to my professors, my peers, my advisor, my parents, anyone who I can ask pretty much, this question: “Should I remain in physics or just drop my major right away?” after talking about some of the stuff that I talked about right now. Then some people would say “It seems like you are clearly not enjoying this, so why don’t just drop it?” and on the other hand, some people would say “But this is just a beginning. Continue for maybe a semester or two and decide if you like it or not.” Both sides have good point and I am not sure which side I should listen to.

I am actually a bit afraid to just drop my major right away since astronomy is a dream that I’ve had for a long time and it consists of a big part of my life. This conundrum is truly giving me hard times these days and I am fighting with myself these days a lot.

Question about Wikipedia article on Special Relativity and Electromagnetism,13,51,False,False,False,Physics,1508839965,True,"The link to the article
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity

I don’t understand the part of the article regarding EM and Relativity, specially the following segment:

“The Lorentz transformation of the electric field of a moving charge into a non-moving observer's reference frame results in the appearance of a mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely electrostatic field in a comoving frame of reference. Maxwell's equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined, one speaks of electromagnetic fields. Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame”

Can someone explain it to me the simplest way possible? How does electromagnetism relate to the theory of special relativity after all?"
Definition of temperature and its relationship to relativity,29,24,False,False,False,Physics,1508839993,True,"So I've been thinking about temperature and its relationship to the root mean square velocity.  This is just some thoughts and an attempt at an open discussion.

In researching the issue, I have read that root mean square translational velocity is only part of temperature which really is determined by oscillation around all degrees of freedom, not just translational degrees of freedom.  

I was thinking, it seems extremely counterintuitive (as [this paper also agrees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02127.pdf) ) to discuss temperature as anything other than lorentz invariant.  

At first glance, it seems like taking the root mean square velocity of the material as a component of the temperature, it would imply that you could have a glass of water frozen to one observer, but boiling in another frame of reference--unless you also presume that boiling points and freezing points depend on reference frame as well. 

 If temperature weren't lorentz invariant, it would imply that stars moving quickly towards or away from us would both appear hotter than they are in their own reference frame.  I'm not sure which would be larger--that or the doppler effect.  Either way, it seems like we'd consistently measure stars further away as hotter than those closer, as the expansion of the universe would put them at more relativistic speeds compared to our reference frame.

Now, if we talk about temperature as lorentz invariant, it seems like there's an easy way to reframe the whole root mean square velocity to make it more intuitive that it is lorentz invariant.   Just call it the standard deviation of velocity instead of root mean square.  The math would be the same, right? 

But then you have the issue of generalizing that to the other oscillators.  So with rotational oscillation, would taking the standard deviation of that oscillation also make more sense as a way to describe the temperature?  

If you have a bunch of particles with a lot of the kinetic components in the form of rotation, but that rotation is all in the same direction at the same angular speed, does it make sense to say the substance has a lower temperature than if they are rotating in random directions as random angular speeds? 

If the whole set of particles were rotating, then at least the common rotation component would be cancelled out by using standard deviation."
Question about conservation of energy,2,0,False,False,False,Physics,1508843530,True,"Alright right out of the gate I wanna say I’m 19 and it’s been 2 years since I did grade 12 physics.

So if you brake harder should it not produce the same amount of wear as if you did it slowly. You’re stopping the same mass, just over a longer period. Can someone explain why it wears brakes faster. Am I not factoring something in?

Quick Question about Nuclear Shell Model,6,7,False,False,False,Physics,1508862750,True,"Hi, 

Today in my nuclear physics class we started learning about quantum field theory. We learned that pi mesons are the carriers of the nuclear force. We also talked about Shell theory and how its simplified model of potential energy and the Schrödinger Equation give rise to energy levels for nucleons. 

From what I understand, individual nucleons can be spinning parallel or antiparallel to the total spin of all the other nucleons. This gives rise to a splitting in energy levels. 

This is the part that confuses me: how can mesons carry the force in this interaction of spins when mesons themselves do not have spin?"
Bottle and straw,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1508863789,True,"My friend asked me a question today, and got me thinking ... He asked me why when a bottle and a straw(In the bottle) falls and hits the ground, the straw bounces up at a higher height and out of the bottle
He said it was the transfer of momentum from contact of bottle with ground to bottle with straw.
I agreed with him but can anyone verify this?

Also, wouldn't this only work if the straw is travelling at a slower speed? I was thinking , if the experiment is conducted at a condition such that the fall height is small; ie negligible resistance, then they would fall with the same acceleration. So, would they jump up to the same height?

Concern of Dark Energy and the Fate of the Universe,4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1508884522,True,"Hello, my name is Verideth, an aspiring physicist. Recently, I read a few physics books, and an idea popped in my head, about the possibility of Dark Energy and two outcomes of the Universe, one idea, is a less respected one, based upon my studies, while the other one supports many theories (Big Bang Theory, Big Crunch, etc.)

My idea took its basis on the conservation of energy. I haven't read much, but Dark Energy is an energy, and can therefore be associated with the law of conservation of energy (assuming no relativistic rules are at play). This is where my idea started too come in, if we were too have the Universe expand to a massive rate, I'm talking billions, maybe trillions, possibly more years in the future, couldn't there be a point where the Dark Energy that is conserved couldn't ""support"" the expansion? Causing one of two thought up possibilities, a Big Crunch esque fate. The Universe decelrates at a rate, and when the Universe finally reaches sub-atomic level, we get a Big Bang, the Universe goes in to the infinite loop, and yers, if you were thinking outside the box, this means the Universe has a constant set age, each, and every lifetime ;)

Second idea, this one is a bit messy, but it still popped in my head. In short, I call it the space-time freeze, and no, not because of cold weather :). Think of a wave, and that waves trough and peak gets infinitely closer to one another as it progresses through time, causing the Universe to be in an infinitely smaller limit of expansion, going back and forth, each time the difference between is smaller, until it reaches a point where its pretty much zero. Whats this mean? Well, it means that due to the Universe decelerating and then accelerating, over and over again, space-time would ripple, because well, the Universe isn't expanding anymore.

That is my idea, feedback on the idea would be much appreciated.

Thanks! Adios! :-)"
Can someone explain Schrödinger's cat?,16,0,False,False,False,Physics,1508885002,True,"Famous thought experiment.

That's all fine and good, but I have no idea how this statement suggests anything about a particle existing in two states at the same time, which is what the experiment seems to require if I understand it right. This is where I'm lost, lol.

Fluid mechanics - What made this soda can burst?,4,2,False,False,False,Physics,1508888979,True,"I had several sodas on the top shelf of my fridge, in the center of the shelf at the very back. One morning I opened my fridge and one soda had fallen over, exploded (the top was totally gone, I still haven't found it), and was frozen solid. Even the bottom was caved outward, indicating the contents expanded when it froze (I assume). But, nothing else beside it was frozen.

[Pictures here!](https://imgur.com/a/MmEmZ)

Nothing else in the fridge had ice forming, I've never touched the temperature controls, and this has never happened in the two years I've had this fridge. And this soda can had never been in the freezer. How could one can freeze but the others right beside it not?

I thought maybe the can was faulty, and if the lid gave out and if the contents suddenly expanded they could possibly freeze? But that might not explain the bottom being caved outward. Perhaps that particular spot in the fridge is colder because of air circulation? I don't have a thermometer but I have set water bottles to try and repeat what happened. I set one upright, one on it's side, and one - mostly empty - water bottle on it's side all in the same area the burst can was. I'll update if they freeze or not.

Non-Physics major looking to go back and pursue physics. Any advice?,7,4,False,False,False,Physics,1508984969,True,"Hi all, a little background:
Graduated a little while ago from a small school with a BS in Accounting. Quickly realized that accounting was just not for me. Started taking classes again at Arizona State University for engineering. After my first physics course/lab, I really fell in love with physics. 

From this, I've been seriously considering pursuing physics further--i ultimately want to go for a Master's and do research. My question is, however, what path should I go? Should I go after another bachelor's, should I just take deficiency courses then apply for a master's, etc.? Anyone else done this? Thanks!

Why is it still assumed that objects with different mass would fall with the same acceleration?,35,2,False,False,False,Physics,1508989457,True,"""Objects that are said to be undergoing freefall, are not encountering a significant force of air resistance; they are falling under the sole influence of gravity. Under such conditions, all objects will fall with the same rate of acceleration, regardless of their mass.""

This doesn't make sense to me, I would be attracted to the Moon slower than to the Earth, and it's not that only I'm attracted to a planet, we both are experiencing the same force, but the vast difference in mass results in vast difference in acceleration. So it would be reasonable to assume that Earth and Moon would experience stronger force than Earth and me, meaning Moon would fall faster than me to the Earth.

I understand initially the comparison like feather and rock would seem impressive, but isn't it obvious that relative to Earth they're virtually the same?

I already know that the Force can be calculated using F=kx, and I also know that F can be set equal to mass times acceleration but I dont know how to relate that to the kinetic energy of the cart or how to get the potential energy of the spring.

A traditional hologram is developed recording the direction of light on film, which creates a code on the film’s 2-dimensional surface. This code can be seen under a microscope. When you shine light through this 2D code, the 3-dimensional object is displayed. This is an excellent illusion, and a company named Zebra Imaging has developed an innovative way to translate CAD models into holographic images (https://youtu.be/Xp7BP00LuA4). In the link you’ll notice they’ve incorperated perspective, which is truly fascinating to me. What I want to touch on is the fact that this code is static. My belief is there exists a possibility to understand this code well enough to make each ‘pixel’ binary, and use a different set of materials to essentially send a voltage through and dynamically alter the code.

Question about the Ehrenfest paradox,5,31,False,False,False,Physics,1509011703,True,"I posted this question on stackexchange and I am posting this here too because I had no answer there so far. 

The Ehrenfest paradox exemplifies that a rigid body can't be defined in special relativity, but I can't convince myself that it implies non-Euclidean geometry as some sources say (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfest_paradox).

In this post question(https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/201492/euclidean-geometry-in-non-inertial-frame), the answers vary from saying that it only implies that rigid bodies can't exist in SR or that it implies, in addition to the former, that the geometry is non-Euclidian.

In my point of view, it only tell us that the theory is not consistent with this thought experiment.

Can we describe quantum mechanics without the non-physical aspects of their complex wavefunction formalisms?,23,0,False,False,False,Physics,1509032172,True,"This question is a little strange and a bit hard to articulate, so please read carefully.

In the wavefunction formalism, we find lots of terms with complex phase factors, like  e^-iaEt, which is probably the most important one to discuss. Specifically, because of two things- 1) E can be set arbitrarily through where we choose to set out zero point, thus changing the rate of change of the complex phase. 2) Given any two wavefunctions (say we're summing them), we only ever care about relative phase and relative rate of change of phase, whatever specific values we choose can be shifted through a change in the definition of [;E;] or a redefinition of [;t=0;].

Essentially when we use these complex number formalisms, most (but not all) of their complex aspects are aphysical, they can be changed arbitrarily.

So my question I guess is, is there a way of doing things without this artifice? Purely in terms of physically meaningful quantities which tell us how wavefunctions (or to be more general, quantum states) evolve, interact, and the measurables they produce?

I'm not necessarily too concerned with being super practical for the majority of day-to-day calculations, this is in essence a more philosophical concern. Just like how I like that all of physics can be represented in completely co-ordinate free ways even as most calculations I'd do involve me choosing a basis to work in for convenience, I'd be happy to know about and talk about quantum mechanics without the aphysical parts even as I use them for convenience.

And please, before you dump a bunch of highly technical maths, recognise that a lot of what seems self evident to you may not be to others, so please explain the reasoning and motivations for definitions/formulations etc when you introduce them."

Homogeneity of space.,1,2,False,False,False,Physics,1509039041,True,"
This is a basic assumption that's made during the derivation of results of special theory of relativity is that space is homogeneous i.e. space intervals shouldn't be given preference based on our choice of origin. However I want to understand more about this assumption and its importance.

Let's imagine an alternate universe where people have gained access to and they travel there and initially find out all laws of physics are just the same as it was in our home universe. They go on to assume that the smallest possible unit of space is a cube of size h^3 where h is planck length. We also assume astronomers on that universe have found a way to measure distance to stars without analysing their luminosity. 

But the observers on that universe find that small stars that should be low mass and consequently low volume and are very far away appear as huge spheres in the night sky. In other words all of their observations point to the fact that the faraway stars who's properties like temperature and radiation tell us it's not big but they appear bigger than their size for some reason. Same applies for other objects too like faraway galaxies appear way bigger than the average in their neighbourhood. And to add to their mystery this only happens when they look at the north sky. The south sky shows objects that appear smaller in size than expected. 

They conclude that the quanta or smallest unit of space varies in length/size compared to theirs as you move vast distances from south to north (with respect to the plane of orbit of their planet) for some unknown reason. That is you cannot have a unit of space smaller than the size of, say your planet, once you reach a certain distance x away from your current location in the northern sky where x is a big number of lightyears. If you were to travel lightyears away into the northern sky the size of your particles and your measuring devices will get bigger in proportion so that you don't notice anything out of the ordinary but you see your home planet shorter than it should be. 

Now my question is that are we completely sure that space is homogeneous i.e. do we observe any properties in stars and galaxies that could tell us that there's some discrepancy in sizes our theories predict and what is observed? 

What are the changes that one would need to observe to develop a theory such as relativity then? For one homogeneity of space assumption must be discarded because it doesn't work on this universe. It does matter what your origin is. Also one has to find a non linear distance formula between two points. Should they experimentally find out the geometry of the universe and necessary distance formulas relative to their choice of origin, do the nonlinear distance formulas have any other effects that aren't simply obvious? What are your thoughts?"

&gt; If one has to summarise in one word what drove the efforts in physics beyond the Standard
Model of the last several decades, the answer is
naturalness
. (For a non-technical introduction
to  the  naturalness  problem  and  for  my  views  on  the  subject,  see  [5, 6].)   Like  it  or  not,
naturalness has been the leitmotiv that has accompanied and motivated most of the attempts
to incorporate the Standard Model into a bigger framework at the weak scale.  There are
good  reasons  for  that.

...

&gt; The privilege of experiencing krisis
Today  the  word  crisis  has  a  sinister  connotation,  suggesting  an  approaching  downfall,  a
moment of difficulty or danger.  This is not the original meaning of the word.  Crisis comes
from the Greek
krisis
, which means “decisive moment”, “turning point”, and was especially
used in a medical context by Hippocrates and Galen as the end of a disease.  This is the
meaning I will refer to and, to stress the idea, I will use the spelling krisis.
Krisis  means  the  opportunity  to  look  at  a  problem  with  new  eyes;  it  is  a  moment  of
change, a discontinuity between past and future.  Krisis does not mean a decline of ideas,
but the search for a paradigm change.

...

&gt; I will refer to the present period of rethinking the directions in particle physics as the
post-naturalness era
.  What are the guiding principles of the post-naturalness era and what
are the emerging new paradigms?  Of course I have no idea.  Today we lack the historical
perspective to see through the fog of the present state of healthy confusion.  All I can offer
are some simple comments (which, most likely, time will show to be wrong) on aspects that
could transform the post-naturalness era into a phase of discovery."
Radon Calculations - Health Physics Question,0,5,False,False,False,Physics,1509042406,True,"I rigged up a very basic radon test in my basement - a MERV 11 20""x20""x1"" filter attached to a box fan running on low speed over one week.  I believe this is enough time for there to reach an equilibrium level of daughter products on the filter, though I may be wrong.  I measured the filter w/ a GM detector ([Ludlum Model 26](http://ludlums.com/component/virtuemart/integrated-frisker-509-detail?activetab=specifications&amp;Itemid=2657)) yesterday and found a pretty even distribution of ~1000cpm over the area of the filter on contact.  I then put a piece of paper b/w the filter and the GM, which reduced counts to ~500cpm.  Playing with these numbers, I'm trying to see if there's a way to (very) roughly equate this to a concentration to compare to the 4 pCi/L remediation limit.  As best I can tell, I need the efficiency of the GM, the volume of air moved through the filter, and some radon daughter product equilibrium information, which is the one I'm struggling with.  The fan specs are 1450 CFM on low, but the filter reduces this value dramatically.  Is this a solvable problem?  I know the uncertainty will be huge, so I will be getting professional testing, I'm just curious from a theoretical POV and also to see some potential ballpark figures."

Huygens Principle Corrected (Question),0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1509069339,True,"Are any of you familiar with this article? https://www-ee.stanford.edu/~dabm/146.pdf — It’s recognized as a legit correction to the Huygens Principle even in Wikipedia. Basically, the author uses **spatiotemporal** dipoles (which I’m not sure I completely understand what is) to eliminate the problem with the backward propagating waves of Huygens. It makes sense.

If you look at the first image on the second page, he says the source to the left must be delayed in respect to the source on the right. Ok. But, assuming both sources emit waves the same way, it looks like the source that’s delayed is the right one, not the left one, can you see? What am I missing? Maybe the two sources aren’t exactly the same?

One thing I didn’t understand from the article was that he attributed a sign to each wave (positive or negative) so maybe that’s where I’m missing something. Maybe one vibrates up and the other down? Instead of both beginning the motion pointing the same direction?

Sorry for the bother and the long post! It’s hard for me because my math is pretty basic compared to this and English is not even my first language. Plus, I’m pretty OCD about these topics, lol. Many thanks anyway!"

I don't get it. If the ground really did accelerate upwards, dropping an apple here and in china at the same time would cause the earth to accelerate in either direction equally, and the apples would never fall.

Does the latest Minute Physics video on time travel in fiction strike anyone else as not being very much about physics?,3,8,False,False,False,Physics,1509117340,True,"You can watch it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3zTfXvYZ9s. I'm not looking to start a hate thread, just want to hear some opinions.

Basically, the video analyzes the depiction of time travel in many works of fiction, looking at what happens when the universe splits into different timelines and stuff. The conclusion seems to be that (out of the examples presented) the only realistic ""time travel"" happens in Ender's Game, which is really just time dilation, and furthermore that the only actual time travel which makes logical sense is the one in Harry Potter. I agree with both of those things.

Still, there's a feeling I always get when people ask about time travel in a physics context, which is that it doesn't really belong there. Not only is time travel not possible as far as we know (which is not a big deal in sci-fi), almost every description of it seems to rely heavily on the concept of a person with consciousness, and what happens to that consciousness and free will when the person travels in time (take Groundhog Day for example, where the thing doing the time travel is Bill Murray's mind instead of any actual physical object). As far as I know, these are not concepts that physics can really talk about, being more in the domain of psychology, neuroscience and even philosophy.

Do you think the subject of time travel as usually depicted in fiction (with *people* traveling in time, timelines splitting and all that good stuff) is something physics can talk about? Or is it beyond what physics covers? Or just logically inconsistent?"

The true essence of energy,8,0,False,False,False,Physics,1509258952,True,"For all to know. I would like to make this a discussion searching for the truth to my question. I am not a physicist and I do not have hard facts only knowledge from those before me. Please check my if I am wrong or mistaken on my observations. One last statement: a PhD is a doctor of philosophy. I am not a PhD merely I have a great wondering about the universe and how it works. Please take my hypothesis for the arguments made and not the background I come from. That being said let's delve deep into my question.

I would like to present my view on the idea of space, time, matter, energy, electricity, and motion. According to Einstein E=mc^2 so basically matter is a manifestation of energy. Therefore every particle is actually energy just in a ""physical"" form. 

Using an analogy to describe my idea, imagine swimming in the ocean. A wave approaches you. The wave is made up of water molecules but as the wave approaches you it is actually the energy of the wave that hits you not the particle ahead of you. The particle that you are beside before the wave hits you is the one that actually ""hits"" you. Imagine a spot on a rope. As the rope is tugged up and down the spot (particle) only moves up and down not forward and backward. The wave (energy) moves from back to front. Therefore it looks like the wave is approaching you, which it is, but the segment of the ocean that constitutes that wave in the distance never actually reaches you. It is stuck in place and only the energy of that wave reaches you.

So that being said I think the next question is what actually is energy then. In terms of electricity it is the flow of electrons. I want to argue that energy is in fact the appearance and disappearance of a particle in still space that creates the illusion of flow but is in actuality a quantum leap but even more than that. It is the creation/manifestation of matter in a specific space followed by the destruction/disappearance of a particle out of completely nothing a void. Could it be that since electrons are the lowest in Mass that energy can easily manifest itself as elections jumping around as a particle giving the illusion of a flow regardless of DC or AC? I also understand the concept behind ionization of gasses causing an electron to jump out of the atom. Using the theory that would mean the position that the electron was at just disappeared and then a new or mirror electron manifested itself further away from the nucleus out of nothing. 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I'm trying my best to express this idea. I look forward to an active discussion. Also if this were the case to be true would that even change how we approach physics? What would we be able to do with that knowledge? 

One last side note this idea comes from my philosophy of living in the moment. We are every single moment. The person I am now is who I am. I am not the same person I was a single second ago. Only my past gives the sense of a flow and continuation in time creating the illusion that I am constant. So to end what is energy?"

And the probability of arriving at the nth state from an initial condition, S_0, is proportional to the nth element of the vector S, where S = S_0 *  P^infinity. That also means that the stationary states are the left eigenvectors of the transition matrix. For some reason, though I can't exactly put my finger on it, this feels like quantum measurements. If there is some connection, that put quantum measurement in terms of a bunch of individual steps happening (like the steps in a Markov chain). My question is twofold:

a) is this connection real? I'm sure that there are important differences, like the fact that the transition matrix only has non-negative real numbers in it, etc.

b) if others have thought about this, can somebody help clarify and elaborate on the connection, or point me to a paper or website that speaks in terms of this connection, like perhaps in conjunction with decoherence?

Study partner?,3,6,False,False,False,Physics,1509329727,True,"Hello,

I'm a physics graduate who is currently hoping to return to graduate school in a couple of years, having sorted out (well, OK, or at least is in the process of sorting out) the various personal and academic problems that plagued me as a student and caused me to leave. In the meantime, I'm seeking to rebuild my physics knowledge and problem solving abilities by going through the various staples of the physics curriculum. It'd be really nice if I could find someone to do this with, both for motivational and pedagogical purposes-for one thing, I find that if I have to explain or run by a concept by some other live human being, it deepens my understanding tremendously. The biggest mistake I made as a student, hands-down, was doing way too much on my own and not making lasting partnerships. Even if I don't get into graduate school, I still want to truly master and visualize the material in a way I didn't as a student. 

I'm starting out with Grffiths E&amp;M and have a pretty systematic course planned ahead beyond that, but I'm open to revising the order of what I visit, depending on what you want or have to study yourself. My background is pretty uneven, which makes things a little tricky: for example, I'm reasonably strong with quantum mechanics-I did OK in graduate level course in the subject and am planning on using Sakurai/Shankar, not Griffiths-but I'm particularly weak with classical mechanics and might have to start with something much more basic. If you are in the SeaTac area, that'd be great, as we could meet up in person. But I'm also OK with setting up a purely remote collaboration. I'm also doing something similar with math, in case you are interested in that. I'm interested in computational and theoretical condensed matter physics and plan on getting re-involved in that kind of research if possible, if that at all matters to you. 

I don't know if this is the appropriate place to post this, but this subreddit was invaluable in inspiring the confidence in me to re-pursue this some months back, so...

PS:

Quantum Logic misunderstands classical logic,24,0,False,False,False,Physics,1509360002,True,"I'm taking this straight from the Wikipedia page for Quantum Logic. It explicitly says that the distributive law of propositional logic fails ...

&gt; Quantum logic has some properties that clearly distinguish it from classical logic, most notably, the failure of the distributive law of propositional logic:

&gt; p and (q or r) = (p and q) or (p and r),

&gt; where the symbols p, q and r are propositional variables. To illustrate why the distributive law fails, consider a particle moving on a line and let

&gt; p = ""the particle has momentum in the interval [0, +1/6]""
&gt; q = ""the particle is in the interval [−1, 1]""
&gt; r = ""the particle is in the interval [1, 3]""

&gt; (using some system of units where the reduced Planck's constant is 1) then we might observe that:

&gt; p and (q or r) = true

&gt; in other words, that the particle's momentum is between 0 and +1/6, and its position is between −1 and +3. On the other hand, the propositions ""p and q"" and ""p and r"" are both false, since they assert tighter restrictions on simultaneous values of position and momentum than is allowed by the uncertainty principle (they each have uncertainty 1/3, which is less than the allowed minimum of 1/2). So,

&gt; (p and q) or (p and r) = false
&gt; Thus the distributive law fails.

This example is misunderstanding propositional logic and the logical v (or) connective at a fundamental level. If we're assuming

(1) the particle's momentum is between 0 and +1/6  
(2) the particle's position is between -1 and +3, and  
(3) that the uncertainty principle holds  

then **both q and r are false statements**, and the distributive law holds. 

Why are both false? In p v r, the truth value of both p &amp; r must be evaluated independently of the other. In other words, you've observed a position between -1 and +3, but that does not mean that you can say that the position is between -1 and 1 (q) or between 1 and 3 (r), because being between q would violate uncertainty and evaluate to false, and r would also violate uncertainty and be false, thus q v r = false because false v false = false.

I'm interested in finding out if anyone realized this mistake."

Returning to a master's,3,3,False,False,False,Physics,1509414818,True,"Hey Reddit,

So I have a bachelor's in physics and math, but I was pretty burnt out by the end of the degree and decided to get an industry job. Turns out it was a really bad fit, so I'm looking for options to go back and get, at least, a master's. I'm pretty keen on Astro, in particular exoplanets, but I didn't do a ton of research as an undergrad (nothing published) and my coding skills are pretty rusty. 

Currently, I'm working part time in a restaurant to support myself while doing (free) research with a prof. The research is cool, but because it's unpaid, and because I can only do it after the part time job, it's harder for him and me to take it seriously and to invest enough into it to make it worthwhile. 

I'm wondering if anyone here has been in a similar situation, and what they did to move into the next steps of academia. I don't know that I'm ready to commit to a PhD, but I'm not necessarily against it. I'm also not sure I could do well on the phys GRE given my time off. My friend who's doing a PhD said that putting in the free work is sort of a prerequisite for getting anything paid, so I think I'm on the right track, but I'm not sure how best to focus my efforts while I'm working. Is it common to find jobs as a research assistant with only a bachelor's? How many hours should I be investing into what is effectively side research? I'm an American, but I would definitely consider moving elsewhere if it meant getting my career going without paying the absurd prices for US grad school. Any thoughts?"

Mystery of Time Overrated,15,0,False,False,False,Physics,1509423393,True,"The only thing mysterious about time is that we attempt to understand it at all. Time is the foundation of understanding -- not the other way around. The only thing that qualifies a statement as fact is its correspondence to a state of the world at a point in time. Because facts are dependent on time, the claim that time has factual properties is tenuous.

Everything in the universe is a function of time. Time itself is no exception to this. But only time is an IDENTITY function of time. An hour from now, a traffic light may be any of three colors; a radio station may be playing any of myriad songs; but the time will be an hour from now. It cannot be anything else. This is too basic even to qualify as tautology. 

The mystery of time lies in its simplicity -- its obviousness. This is what makes it difficult to grasp -- even to define. It is the one most simple thing in all creation necessary for a logical foundation for all else.

This is why the principle of contradiction asserts that it's impossible for a thing to be and not be AT A POINT IN TIME; the principle of the excluded middle asserts that a thing must be or not be AT A POINT IN TIME. And their conjunction -- the principle of bivalence -- which governs the necessity and impossibility of being, also applies at a point in time.

I thought science was all about mathematical proof and testing shit over and over and over again until you are SURE about the truth. 

EDIT: Alright so we know there is dark matter because it's effects can be seen, it must logically exist for everything else to work. It's not a plug for what we don't know, but a term for a different type of matter that must exist. Awesome. Thanks. That's what I wanted to know :)"

Help me resolve this paradox?,3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1509583657,True,"By ""paradox"", I mean there's a flaw in my reasoning, but I don't know what the flaw is.

I'm considering (1) a mass-spring chain (illustrated [here](http://www.ablongman.com/mullin/AnimationPages/FigX-6.html)) and (2) an electronic circuit consisting of alternating capacitors and inductors.

The mechanical system and the electronic system should be described by the exact same differential equation, by analogy:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical-electrical_analogies

Feynman also describes the analogy:

http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_23.html

These papers (which are mostly over my head) say the spring-mass system will have multiple resonances:

http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~djmorin/waves/normalmodes.pdf

http://www.physics.usu.edu/riffe/3750/Lecture%205.pdf

But my understanding of circuit-analysis is that the electric circuit should have only one resonance, and that view is corroborated by this other Reddit thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/79tps8/system_response_of_a_series/

So something is wrong with my reasoning. Why aren't the mechanical system and electric circuit showing identical behavior?"

What Double Major should I do?,7,1,False,False,False,Physics,1509590899,True,"Hello, I got so much helps and advices from the redditers here in r/physics and I just wanted to thank you guys all for giving me such many pieces of advices.

I was contemplating about dropping physics and I just decided to give a semester or two to decide if I should or not. (details here  https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/78e15t/contemplating_myself_about_dropping_physics_major/) I am also wondering if I should take this intro astronomy class or intro computer programming class (since the classes meeting time overlap) and I have yet to decide.

However, the question I would want to ask is... which Double Major should I do, if I want to become an astrophysicist in the future?

I can still graduate in 4 years with the double major since my school has no core curriculum at all and my school is also very flexible so we can double major within multiple schools as well (Arts and Science, Engineering). Double Majoring is extremely common here (more than 70% of students end up doing double major). 

So I have some options in my mind: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, (maybe) Computer Science. 

For Pure Math, I just need to add 4 more courses in addition to the math course which my physics major would require. It's like Analysis I, Partial Diff EQ, Advanced Algebra I, and one random electives in 300-400 level. This is possible since there is so many requirement overlaps with physics major.

For Applied Math, I need to add courses like Intro to Matlab/Python, Discrete Math, Intro to Prob, Intro to Stats, Intro to Optimization, two random electives in 300-400 level. So there is a lot of overlap with Physics major and applied math as well, but not as many as pure math. Still doable. 

Comp Sci I probably need to add like 13-14 more courses. This might be tough and this is not an attractive option. Maybe a minor could be a good way to go since I need to add like 6-7 more courses. 

So considering my interest in astrophysics, which double major could help in the long run? If you don't see a major that you recommend in my list, you can recommend by yourself. Thanks so much!"

Can you guys help me understand what's going on here ?,1,2,False,False,False,Physics,1509621904,True,"   Hello everyone ! First time poster in /r/Physics, lurker before that, also physics undergraduate. With a friend we stumbled upon this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-V1uXeyGmg&amp;t) and we're trying to understand what's going on.  

 For those who can't watch the video, it's about reflecting a laser pointer on a piece of mirror attached to some kind of membrane (an infatable balloon membrane here). Then you make the membrane vibrate with an audio speaker and what happens is surprisingly interesting : the image reflected by the laser on a flat surface describes multiple shapes, which depend on the frequency of the sound. 

 - If it's music, the ever-changing frequencies and the superposition of them produce random patterns. 
 - If you play a single, pure note (let's say an A 440 Hz), you get an oval shape that stay static (2:50 in the video). 
 - If you superpose two frequencies, then you get two (kind of) moebius strips that revolve around one another in a constant motion (2:55)
 
There are surely a lot more to discover and we're really excited to build our device to explore more. We would also like to do some Physics on this stuff, using different frequencies and sounds, see if the volume has a role, maybe using different kind of membranes... and controlling precisely with the speaker the shapes appearing on the wall, which I think is related to deriving a mathematical description of the shapes so we could make predictions about what is going to appear. The first thing that came to my mind when I saw the video was [Lissajou's curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve), mostly around 7:20. Could it be that the phase shift between the audio signal and what we see on the wall produces those shapes ? It also reminded me (kind of) of a Harmonograph.

I'll take any ideas !

Completely lost (but not yet hopeless) physics undergrad just trying to graduate,26,3,False,False,False,Physics,1509631023,True,"Hey, r/physics. I hope this is the right place for my post.

I used to be one of those kids who could get easy A's without much effort, get amazing scores on standardized tests, everyone thought I was a genius, etc (emphasis on *used to be*). This was my experience until high school, where I ended up making some bad life choices and experimenting and partying and basically screwing up my high school grades without a care. It wasn't terrible, I think I ended up only failing one class, but I had B's and C's for the rest of them. By my senior year in high school I ended up getting my shit together, took a physics class and knew that was what I wanted to do. I took a year off to save up, got a transfer degree at a community college and then got into a big state university by last fall semester. So with where I'm at, I am technically a junior in my degree.

However, going into community college and lacking the studying techniques/exam taking/stress managing techniques that I should have built up in high school resulted in me taking the slacker ""C's get degrees"" road; I relied on online solutions for my homework and cram-studied for exams. This has gone on until where I am now, it's gotten a little better as far as not cram studying anymore but I am not doing the homework the right way because it seems that I can't. I can't critically think about this stuff, and even if I do I end up doubting myself so much that I have to check solutions anyway. Having done this for years, too, means I don't have any of the basic building blocks of calculus and physics drilled into my brain the way other students in my year do. I have to constantly re-teach myself basics just to get through ""easy"" problems. And at this point, every time an exam comes I get crazy anxiety about it because every exam seems like a closer chance at failing a class (which by some miracle I haven't done yet). I feel so stupid, all the time.

So here I am, in a university getting straight C's (well, I think I got one B) in my core classes. I originally wanted to get a Doctorate degree because my passion for physics lies in direct research, which it seems you need a Doctorate for. Now, that seems like an unattainable goal. No grad school will accept me with my awful GPA (if I manage to graduate), and even if they did I would probably just fail out of grad school. I wanted to get this degree so bad, and I wanted to go to grad school so bad, but apparently not bad enough.. I have no idea what to do now. It seems that every semester I have to play catch-up with all the stuff I should have learned years ago just to scrape by with a passing grade. I work part-time and commute 2 hours a day (my U is about an hour away), and I don't really have the abundance of time that the straight A students have so I am kind of at a loss as to how I can help myself out of this. I feel like a failure all the time because of my grades and my lack of knowledge, I feel like I don't belong in my classes or in my degree program, I feel like I'm an idiot running around wearing a smart person mask. Overall, it's really depressing me and when I do get the time to study, I end up thinking about how bad all of this seems right now and wanting to give up. I still have a very small beacon of hope that I can do this, well because if I didn't, I have nothing else in life I would actually want to do (career wise). I don't know what to do but I have to figure it out fast, I feel like failing something and messing up my career path is imminent with the way I've been going. But I don't even know if I'm capable of fixing years of terrible 'learning' habits, it seems like an impossibly deep hole now.

Thanks for reading, I would be grateful for any advice at all.

TL;DR: I'm a junior physics undergrad in a state university, getting straight C's due to poor studying techniques and lack of basic concepts. I wanted to go to grad school originally but now even graduating with a bachelor's degree seems unrealistic. This is all I want to do but I don't even know if I'm capable. Any advice is welcome."

"I'm going for a undergraduate degree in physics after I finish school this year, however, the math and concepts seem terrifying to me.",12,1,False,False,False,Physics,1509647943,True,"Obviously I'm not versed AT ALL, in these subjects, but when I hear or read about things like general relativity, quantum physics, and thermodynamics, it makes me feel dull. I'm of only average intelligence, and my math skills are okay at best (I haven't even taken calculus yet).

But on the other hand, I have wondered for a long time what it is I wanted to go to college for (or if I wanted to go at all), and physics seems like fun. I won't lie, my interest in physics is average; I'm not infatuated with it, I'm more of a changing interests type of person in the first place, but I would love to know how the universe works.

So from someone who knows nothing on what it's like to get a physics major, to hopefully a number of individuals who do, is it worth it going for a physics degree if I:

1. Have a shaky foundation in math, and slightly above average intelligence at best.

2. Only care about physics to a *point*. I'm not passionate about it, I just find the prospect of understanding all these amazing phenomena to be sweet.

Question about basic magnetic property of a hydrogen atom,3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1509649447,True,"So, I was recently talking to my physics professor, who clued me in a bit more on why things have a magnetic field in the first place. As he put it, the rotation by the electron around the neutron creates a current and a distance, which then creates the magnetic field along the perpendicular axis. 
But I've also been told that an object that is not moving relative to another object has no magnetic effect on that other object. This may be wrong, and would then explain my question.

So, what if we took a hydrogen atom with one electron and gave it an angular velocity that was equal but opposite that of the electron orbiting it, so that effectively, relative to the earth, that electron was not moving. Instead, the nucleus was spinning backwards.

Would this atom still create a magnetic charge from the spin of the nucleus, would the electron make a field anyway just due to it's nature, or would the magnetic field be effectively 0 at that point in time that the relative velocity was 0?

Just something that came to my mind today. If anyone has any insight on this, I'd love to hear it."

Background - I am comfortable with C++, Numerical Methods(have used GSL in computer graphics) and have used Python mainly in machine learning.

I read some related posts here and searched for books on Amazon, I came across these two books:

1) Mark Newman's Computational Physics

2) Landau's Computational Physics:Problem Solving with Python.

Which one should I go for between these two? I saw that Landau's book covers more topics compared to Newman's. Any other suggestions are also welcome.

Thank You."
Conservation of Energy Question,2,4,False,False,False,Physics,1509732995,True,"If we were to place, and set in motion, a Newton's cradle inside a box of O2 gas--with the box being constructed of some material that was entirely unable to conduct heat-- upon the conclusion of the cradle's motion, would we see an increase in the temperature of O2 that is proportional (in accordance with q = mcΔT) to the initial gravitational potential energy in the ""starter"" ball just before the cradle's cycle was initiated? Could we switch out O2 with hot water (on the verge of boiling), and consequently produce some H2O gas?  

My thought process is that since the system would be isolated (I think?), then net energy should be constant. However, potential and kinetic components/mechanical energy should eventually dissipate entirely, leaving only the heat given off as the result of friction in the cradle. I would therefore expect this heat energy to be equal to the initial gravitational potential energy at the start of the experiment (when all other energy components were equal to zero), and thus raise the temperature by some degree that is proportional to mgh at start point (i.e. could we predict the temperature change based on how far back the first ball was drawn?). 

Forgive me if this thought experiment is elementary, I just want to make sure I am grasping this idea of conservation of energy properly. Thanks. "

However the existence of this change in behavior, and what happens beyond the plasma frequency, stumps me.

1. We build a wormhole to a galaxy about 100 million light years away, and then push a small army of massive telescopes through it. Once there, they'll organize behind a large black-hole and use gravitational lensing to focus on the dinosaurs.

2. We build a device that can build millions of wormholes about 100 million light years away that capture and send back the light. The light is then processed back on Earth and we can see dinosaurs walking around on a zoomable, ancient but live version of Google Maps.

3. We collect light bounced back from about 50 million light years away and use that to see into the past. (no wormholes required in this one)

A solid device that changes the direction of force (Robotics),2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1509987972,True,"Hey r/physics. I'm trying to build an autonomous robot that pushes other robots out of a circular arena. Most other people don't have good programming skills, so the behavior of most robots is simple. Find the enemy robot and push. My question is if there is a device that could be put on the front ""bumper"" that would transform the enemy's robot push momentum into sideways force, therefore lowering its effects on my robot and giving me an edge in head-to-head push wars. Think about it as a simple, solid machine, that transform pushing force into something else.

I'm thinking of two objects in space, each of similar material, albedo etc, just different temperatures.

- The hot object must have a greater energy flux, but is that primarily due to there being more photons emitted, or do both objects emit photons at a similar rate just with different wavelengths?"

"If all motion is relative, what happens if you fix your reference frame to a photon?",18,0,False,False,False,Physics,1510028452,True,"Instead of viewing a photon as expanding in all directions, you can see it as space around the photon collapsing inward at the speed of light. This does not mean objects within space are accelerated, they remain at rest relative to each other. Wouldn't the end result be the same? Is this not a valid reference frame? 

To paint a picture, imagine a photon being created in the center of a hallow sphere. You can view the propagation of the photon as it expanding toward the edges of the sphere, or you can view it as space around the edge of the sphere collapsing inward towards the photon. The polarization of the photon should determine the geometry of the collapsing space.

If you apply this ""model"" to the double slit experiment, instead of viewing the photon traveling towards the two slits, you can view the space in and around the slits collapsing towards the photon. By the time it reaches the photon, the space within and around the slits would be extremely warped. This could cause the holes in the sheet to be stretched and rotated to such an extreme, that the two slits are in front of each other relative to the photon, allowing it to pass through both slits, one at a time."

Osmosis: Why it happens,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1510081614,True,"Osmosis is not only often misunderstood; many don't try to understand it at all. Here's a simple description of the exact mechanics.

(Quick jargon repetition: solution = solute solved in solvent. Solvent passes through semipermeable membrane, solute doesn't.)

The important thing to notice is, there's not just gradient equalling happening. There's actual momentum produced, capable of overcoming other forces.

This momentum is translated from the movement of the particles in each solution, not caused by some external force on the solution.

Remember: one solution moves freely. The other bounces off a surface, causing movement in the opposite direction.

The momentum ""into"" each side is equal to the reflection momentum of the particles of solute that hit the membrane. It is proportional to kinetic energy in solution.

The concentration gradient equalling is a secondary effect of this momentum. Solvent particles move along the pressure gradient caused by reflection momentum.

Calling osmosis a special case of diffusion, is wrong. Diffusion does not generate pressure."

Innocent question about antimatter/matter in the universe,10,4,False,False,False,Physics,1510102169,True,"I will start off by admitting I am just delving into physics, I am a total noob when it comes to more advanced theoretical stuff compared to the basics I am studying at university right now.

So my inquiry: Many physicists are puzzled as to why equal amounts of matter and antimatter weren't created at the instance of the big bang only to annihilate into no universe, or go off to form antigalaxies. I remember reading somewhere that one of the physicists who began looking into antimatter nearly a century ago said the square root of any positive number can be a negative or positive value, and he used this to partially justify the theory (I think). Based off that, couldn't the answer to the question as to why antimatter and matter didn't spawn in equal quantities be as simple as a coin flip? A quarter flipped with perfectly constant variables (height from the ground, force of the flip, placement of the fingers on the coin) every time will always land on the same side, but a quarter flipped with random variables will be unpredictably mixed, heads or tails; sometimes there will be more heads or tails, sometimes they may be even in occurrence, right?

Becoming an amateur/hobbyist physicist?,14,5,False,False,False,Physics,1510175995,True,"Hi all!

I am a 26 year old Computer Science student. I am currently taking Physics I (Newtonian/rotational kinematics, energy/work, momentum, wave motion, etc). I love science in general, and what I would really love to get into is astrophysics, celestial mechanics, etc. As a computer scientist/programming, I'd love to start with a rudimentary simulation related to that. I spend a lot of my spare time reading articles about space, QM, particle physics, and so on.

I have considered double-majoring in physics (or even taking a minor), but I'm choosing to focus on a career in software development/engineering as it gives me the widest range of opportunities and let's me have a little more control over where I live (important, as my fiancee and I want to stay near family so they can help with children in a couple of years). In other words, I would rather graduate early and start working full-time again while pursuing physics on the side.

Anyway, I love learning this kind of stuff. I'm not very self-confident in my math skills, although I generally got As and Bs until I got my first ever D in Calc 2 so I'm told I'm better at it than I think, heh. So what I'd like to ask is...What are some things I can do to stay connected to the field of physics? I know I probably won't be conducting front-line research, but I would still love to interact with professionals, continue learning about new discoveries, and find a way to make an impact of my own as an amateur ""astrophysics nerd."""

Well I was thinking to myself, how come that rule does not apply if those objects are in water, and I came up with this answer (to my own question lol)

Objects under water will fall faster depending on their speed because water is an object, and solid objects can move through liquid objects. Weightless objects will not move through water, but heavy objects will move through water fast, yet there is a limit to how fast said object can move through the water. A solid object cannot fall through water faster than its gravitational pull, because still water cannot speed up another object."

Question about linear/angular momentum.,4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1510235440,True,"I'm trying to understand the relationship between linear and angular momentum imparted onto a rigid body via a collision. If there is an object (say a spacecraft)  that collides with a free floating rigid body, how do you determine how much of the momentum imparted on the body is angular vs linear?

**Essentially, what I'm having trouble understanding is will the magnitude of linear momentum imparted on the rigid body be independent of the angle/direction of the collision?** Simply the mass of the incoming object, multiplied by the velocity vector (P = mV). 

It's just counter intuitive to me that if a collision were to impart a large amount of angular momentum because it strikes with a certain lever arm, the linear momentum imparted will be the same as if it were acting directly in line with the center of gravity.

An example in case it isnt clear. A flat cylinder with a large radius compared to the height, in free space. It is impacted on the face, near the edge- a large amount of angular momentum will be imparted. Now compare to it being impacted on the 'height' side, same mass and velocity. Almost no angular momentum will be imparted on the body, since there is not much of a lever arm... will the linear momentum imparted on the object be the same in both cases?

So really space is the cognitive construct. 

Time is the real object. We have constructed space as the relations at the current time. 
But the distance between objects in space is equivalent to a time.

Similarly, the speed difference between two object moving at relative speed to one another are experiencing a relative rotation that we refer to as a Lorentz transform.

That rotation also occurs as a result of gravity, in a general way, whereby acceleration due to gravity is no different from an acceleration of anything else, which implies that gravity is a change in Lorentz transform down (redshift) in time forward."

A person drops a ball from the top of a building while another person on the ground observes the ball's motion. Will these two people always agree on the following?
a. the ball's potential energy
b. the ball's change in potential energy
c. the ball's kinetic energy

My understanding is that both people would agree on all of these. I don't see why they wouldn't agree on all of these. My question is, will the person on the ground observe something different from the person at the top of the building? If so, why would they observe something different?"

Now, out of curiosity, how could I apply this to a rolling Reuleaux Triangle (for those who don't know what that is, it's a [curved triangle of constant width](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/gifs/reuleaux.gif)).

Doubts about the Age of the Universe,7,5,False,False,False,Physics,1510467388,True,"Ok, I've been trying to understand this for quite a while and I keep having troubles. My english is not perfect, so I'll try my best to express myself correctly. Why is the Universe 13,8 billion years old?

As far as I understand this is how it goes:

We know the Universe is expanding because galaxies are redshifted. More distant galaxies are more redshifted than closer galaxies because their light has traveled for more time in that expanding space.

Therefore, there must've been a time when the entire universe was compressed into a single point, which we would consider the start of time.

If we run the clock backwards, knowing the expansion rate of the universe, we can know the time that has passed since the singularity to its current size.

But the expansion hasn't been constant, it has varied throughout the universe's history, so we have to take that into account.

I've read that if we measure the distance to galaxies and their respective redshift, we can make sort of like an expansion history, and use that to calculate the time since the Big Bang. That's the part I don't get.

How does the distance-redshift relation work? How do we measure distances to galaxies? For this last question, I know we've used standard candles (Type 1a supernova), but doesn't the expansion itself affect this measurment the same way it affects wavelength? I mean, from the time a galaxy emmited a photon, the distance that photon would've had to travel to reach us increased, so its intensity decreased more than it should've. Doesn't that mean we see galaxies way fainter than they actually are, and thus, we think they're further away? Wouldn't that galaxy that we see 13 billion light years away actually be a little closer at the time it emmited that light?

My head hurts :(

Btw, I tried to understand this mostly through PBS Spacetime's video on the subject."
Why is the average kinetic energy = 3kt/2 instead of 4kT/pi for an ideal gas?,10,1,False,False,False,Physics,1510475735,True,"We can compute the mean speed = sqrt(8kT/(pi*m)), rms velocity =sqrt(3kT/m), and mean kinetic energy = 3/2kT all from the maxwell velocity distribution as shown here: https://casper.berkeley.edu/astrobaki/index.php/Maxwellian_velocity_distribution (mean speed &amp;  rms velocity)
and shown here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem#Brownian_motion (mean kinetic energy under ""Kinetic energies and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution"").

So, it seems 3kT/2 fits with the equipartition theorem and can be found from finding the RMS velocity from the Maxwell velocity distribution. Are there cases when we could/should use v_avg instead, which would lead to 0.5*m*v_avg^2 = 4kT/pi? Is there a deeper meaning to why kinetic energy matches with v_rms of the maxwell distribution other than both just happening to use v^2?

Thanks!

Since a household mirror reflects almost all the visible light, a transparent glass, which transmits all the visible light, successfully resembled a mirror by matching the background and exact opposite light reflections in this case.

Now, what I really want to know is: If glass were to be made to be look like a polished metal (which absorbs and diffuses a bit of light in all wavelength than a household mirror giving that silver impression) what necessary changes are to be made to make a glass (or any thin transparent sheet) appear like polished metal (reflection like silvery surface in the eyes of viewers)?

To put it differently: Can a transmitted light be made to look like it's coming from metallic surface as reflected light?

I've searched a lot on the internet for the answer to my question, but could not find a reasonable answer I am looking for. I know it is possible in software programs like Photoshop, but I want to know if it is possible in the real world in any way theoretically if not practically.

Dark Matter Thought Experiment,6,2,False,False,False,Physics,1510502929,True,"For the sake of this thought experiment, assume that universes as large as ours are few and far between but tiny universes are much much more common.

If independent ""bubbles"" of spacetime (very, very small compared to our universe) formed and pinched off from our spacetime membrane (or just inflated independently) around the time of the Big Bang and these ""bubbles"" have a great deal of energy trapped inside, would they have similar effects on our universe as dark matter?

He found a clip of someone swinging on a trapeze (circular swing arc) and we're trying to figure out how the person's center of mass affects the force on their hands (the tension on the rope, same thing) throughout the swing.  We're doing this by treating the rope and the bar, and the person's arms to their center of mass, as a [double pendulum.](https://i.gyazo.com/b5eac192736c58484dec9f82e0debdea.png)

In other words, we're trying to create **an equation where we input a swing angle** (absolute value of angle of rope to bar) and it **outputs the optimal angle of the person's center of mass** to minimize the force on their hands.  [Here's](http://www.phys.lsu.edu/faculty/gonzalez/Teaching/Phys7221/DoublePendulum.pdf) a resource I found to illustrate.  Specifically, we want to use [this equation.](https://i.gyazo.com/cedf82dd49388fc3a257d7ca3d0a67bc.png)

We're also assuming the bar's weight is negligible, because we don't want to over complicate this for ourselves :)

My friend insists the answer is going to be so simple it's dumb, but I'm not so sure.

Generalizing the Path Integral?,2,2,False,False,False,Physics,1510605305,True,"What I already know: you have a starting point and an end point, you add the quantity e^iS over all classical paths connecting those two points, and you recover the Schrodinger equation.


This only applies to situations in which the initial and final states are position eigenvalues. Is there a generalization of this to more complicated initial and final states?


For example, instead of starting at a certain position, maybe integrate over all classical paths that begin with a certain initial *energy*. Then perhaps you would recover the position space wavefunction for an energy eigenstate?


Or, even worse, what if the initial state is some superposition of eigenstates? Then I wouldn't even know how to heuristically guess the start points of the functional integral, since there is no classical analogue!

I'm an electrical engineering student and i love physics. I love to learn about it, but today when me and my school-friend had a talk about gravity and magnetism, we came up with a strange question. 


That question is how even forces (acceleration) do work? I know that gravity is well described by Newton (F=(G*m*M)/r^2 ) or by Einstein (Universe is curved so two paralel lines on curved object must meet eventualy). But these are descriptions of how things are. I can't honestly find an answer. If i have an elecromagnet and i put currect through it, it will atract ferromagnetic piece of metal, okay. But how? What is the ""thing"" that pushes the piece of metal and accelerates it? Electrons? Photons? I am lost, ladies and gentlemen. 


Could anyone be such a dear and give me answer (requiring any amount of education). I will be glad for any answers, becasou this boggles my mind.

Quantum tunnelling,2,3,False,False,False,Physics,1510679143,True,"I studied in earlier courses the ""basic"" theory of quantum tunnelling (mainly with WKB approximation) and, as far as I know, the transmission rate T is the same for both sides of the potential, so both left mover particles and right mover particles have the same probability of tunnel through the barrier.

During another course however I studied quantum point contact and the Landauer formula which uses exactly this idea that T is the same for both kind of movers. I was thinking if there were quantum system where this isn't the case and you can have different transmittion ratio. I'm pretty sure you can't change this at a foundamental level, but maybe there are systems that work ""as if"" the coefficient T had different values of the two sides.

I was thinking for example if the QPC is narrow enough, and the number of impurity really small, there might happen to be many impurity on one side of the QPC (let's say left side) and very little on the other. In this case some right movers electrons might just ""hit"" the impurity and jump right back in the thermal bath, while left movers coming from right side would scatter at the end of their travel thus reducing T from that side.

Sorry if it's not clear (maybe I'm not using standard notation? I can try to phrase better) or if it's just dumb (we all have dumb questions at some point I guess), but had the urge to ask."

Need help determining the likely point of impact for car accident,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1510710617,True,"I feel like this subreddit would probably be helpful to answer my questions, correct me if I am wrong though. I also posted in the car subreddit. 

My fiancé was merging onto the highway and collided with a large truck (large box truck/commercial vehicle).. the car spun out to the right and then the front passenger corner hit the truck during the spin which is where the noticeable damage is (headlight shattered, basically a hole in the corner of the car there). Then the car continued spinning until it was facing the correct way again on the highway.

Where was the likely original point of impact? The rear bumper has some random paint chipped along the whole back of it and then the rear drivers side door has some random pushed in line on it. Problem is that this is an old car that was already marked up on the sides and trunk. The rear had all sorts of dirt on it after the accident and I know that the paint wasn't chipped there before because I had cleaned some of that area of a bumper sticker awhile earlier...I'm not sure about the rear drivers side door having a line on it before or not. It's not noticeable even in pictures, you have to look for it basically, so I'm not sure if I just never noticed. I'm not sure why the car would spin out though if it was rear ended? Why wouldn't there be more damage at the original point of impact?"

Unusual theoretical question concerning gravity,5,11,False,False,False,Physics,1510746643,True,"So I wasn't sure whether to go here or to ELI5 or somewhere else, but here's the question: 

what (general) influence would a slightly variable gravity have on nature, life, the world as we know it... ? 
I understand that earth's standard gravity is 9.807 m/s^2, ranging from 9.764 to about 9.834 across the earth's surface. So I'm talking about a theoretical world where gravity would change gradually and cyclically throughout the year, let's say for example between about 9 and 10 m/s^2.

A “time mirror” in space... already thought of?,6,1,False,False,False,Physics,1510757264,True,"I had an idea for a “time mirror” in space. Basically a mirror set very far from the earth that would reflect light back to the future position of the earth. The round trip time for the reflection of the past earth to reach the future earth would be twice the distance in light years. So if the mirror were 10 light years away from earth, the reflection we would see of earth in the mirror would be earth 20 years ago(!)

Anyway, am I late to the party on this one? Is this already an idea?

Obvious problems are...

• Getting a mirror that far out and then slowing it down so it’s motionless. 

• Having it oscillate so that it is pointing at the correct angle all the time, which would be based on earth’s orbit at two different points in time.

• It’s angular size being extraordinarily small at such a distance. This might be overcome by making the mirror slightly concave, focusing the reflected light back to a point in earth’s orbit where a passive observerving instrument could also manipulate the light stream it to, say, zoom in on things.

• the usefulness compared to a telescope that far out that broadcasts the image back to earth. This would solve the first two issues, but it would limit the data on the telescope broadcast to that of the resolution of the telescope’s broadcast."

"What does ""canonical"" mean?",20,21,False,False,False,Physics,1510764052,True,"I have seen the word ""canonical"" used in a few different combinations with other words in physics, usually with some link to statistical concepts. Like, the ""canonical partition function"", ""canonical ensemble"" or ""canonical probability distribution"". 

A quick google turns up nothing useful about the meaning of the term, just things like *""included in the list of sacred books officially accepted as genuine""*. Thanks Google!

I guess my question is kinda two-fold. 

1. First. What is the technical (statistics-related?) meaning of the word? Like for instance, what is the difference of an ""ensemble"", and a ""canonical ensemble"", etc?

2. And second, is there some original meaning, outside of physics, that can motivate why the term was introduced into physics terminology in the first place? Way back when?

Quality mathematical physics journals (heavy on the math)?,22,108,False,False,False,Physics,1510777451,True,"Hi all,

I don't post much here, mostly comment. I figured it would be my turn to inquire about something! I'm having some difficulty with journals lately. I'm a mathematician who dabbles in mathematical physics (though exclusively from the math side of things). My paper didn't make it past the editor at Journal of Physics A. Based on the comments I got back, the editor completely did not understand the work and used one or two slightly fluff sentences as a reason to ax the paper. To be fair, it's a *very* math heavy paper and may not have been a great fit, but it's water under the bridge. At the Journal of Mathematical Physics, my paper is struggling to even secure referees after several months. So I'm looking for a different journal.

My question is: what is the opinion of World Scientific journals, namely Reviews in Mathematical Physics? I've always felt a bit uneasy about World Scientific for reasons I don't really understand myself (possibly mostly due to unfamiliarity?). What are some other quality mathematical physics journals?"

Cumulative force on a piston,1,1,False,False,False,Physics,1510935546,True,"Hello all!

So, the question that I've come up with is as follows (I format it as a homework question as I feel that it conveys my problem well):

A 5.00 kg piston that is 20.0 mm in diameter sits in a frictionless tube (also 20.0 mm) with 200.0 kPa pushing against the atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa).  If the tube is 1.50 m (1.50x10^4 mm) long, what velocity does the piston have as it leaves the tube?

So, the main issue here is that the volume (and thus the force on the piston) changes as the piston is moved down the tube.  At any moment, we can calculate the current force acting on the piston; but how can we find the cumulative force that acts on it, and then the velocity as it leaves the tube?

Of the things I know, my best guess is a derivative or integral, although I'm honestly unsure.

The more practical application that I have for this problem is the calculation of a bullet travelling down a barrel.

Thank you for any help, as it is greatly appreciated!"

"Master's in Physics, or get a second Bachelor's?",9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1510969237,True,"I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Physics this past summer. I wanted to find work, then work on a graduate program of some sort a bit later. However, I have been having a difficult time finding any work that could at least partially use my physics degree. I have noticed quite a few people on this sub have had similar problems.

Now a few months later and no job prospects, I wonder how much going back to school would help. I wouldn't mind too much doing a graduate program sooner than expected, but the one readily available to me is a generalized Master's in Physics, rather than something focused like Nuclear Physics.

My concern is how much more helpful would a general master's be? Since my current problem seems to be that I'm not really specialized for something specific. I also don't plan on trying to be a Professor. Alternatively, I could get a second Bachelor's in something like engineering (redundant?) or biochemistry. It would probably be best to have it in a specific field opposed to another generalized degree as well. I am assuming it would be the same thing as having a double major.

I am not sure which would be better for finding work, having a master's or a second bachelor's. My only decent work experience is in IT, although I did let my CCNA expire while working on my Physics degree. My main concern to actually finding work rather than doing what I want/like to do, since doing what I enjoyed landed me in the position of not having any work. This must be how artists feel."

"I️ had a sudden realization but know little about physics, am I️ crazy?",6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1511002374,True,"So i was doing some late night reading and stumbled across an article talking about how atoms are mostly empty space, like if a hydrogen atom was the size of the earth, the proton would be something like 200 meters across. 

this got me thinking about why then we appear to be solid? if every bit of matter that exists is made of atoms, but atoms really aren’t solid themselves, what the hecky darn is going on?

we can all agree that mass is just a property of energy, and since we really don’t have that much matter that makes us up, most of our mass must be the “empty space” of these atoms that isn’t actually empty at all, it is just energy that hasn’t manifested into dense matter, giving us the illusion of weight, but i️ digress.

so again to why we can’t just walk through walls and stuff, well this got me started on thinking what it would be like to be an atom? or to be the parts that make up an atom, rather. well if atoms move at over 2000 km/s then that’s a lot of potential to be in a lot of different places really fast, right? i️ mean us humans don’t move that fast that’s for sure. 

so this thought got me onto Einstein, and how he found time is relative to the observer. if you are moving at the speed of light, time will move “slower” for you than for a person on earth not moving at the speed of light.  but what if time is not moving slower? what if the moment that you are perceiving is actually getting longer? you are able to experience a higher percentage of the speed of light, and therefore also able to experience more time in each moment?

so back to atoms, since these atoms are moving so much faster than us in our macroscopic world, each atomic “moment” they are able to be in more places at once than we are able to exist in in our much slower and denser moments, or ticks of time so to speak? they are literally just experiencing a higher percentage of the speed of light than us and therefore have more time, and more probability to be in a higher number of places that our slower concept of time would perceive to be happening “at once”. multiple atomic moments make up larger human sized moments.

is this why things are solid? since we are moving slower than the atoms we perceive them in more places at once than they actually are?

sorry if all this is a bit rambley, it’s 4 in the morning and i️ just woke up in the middle of the night and had this thought. this is still kinda fuzzy to me as well, but i️ got the feeling that this was somehow important so hopefully someone with any sort of actual knowledge about physics can help give some perspective.

thank you all and much love!"

Which Weighs More: A Pound of Feathers or a Pound of Gold? An Ounce of Feathers or an Ounce of Gold? (They are both being weighed on Earth),3,0,False,False,False,Physics,1511049965,True,"Trick question, right? They both weigh the same because a pound is the same as a pound? Well, not exactly...

A pound of feathers weighs more. This is because feathers are weighed using the Avoirdupois system, whereas gold (as are silver and drugs) is weighed using the Troy system. A pound on the Avoirdupois scale is greater than a Troy pound. 

Conversely, an ounce of gold weighs more. The Troy system has 12 ounces to a Troy pound, whereas in the Avoirdupois system, a pound consists of 16 ounces. So a Troy ounce is greater than an Avoirdupois ounce.

These two puzzles demonstrate the vital importance of defining precisely the units in which a measurement is made. Units of measurement are objective, ultimately reflecting some measure in the world as observed by man. Thus, the measure of length is a foot, the measure of the size of a horse is the hand. Both the Troy system and the Avoirdupois system are based on the weight of a grain of wheat as developed by man, which (to use the metric system) is 0.0648 grams. A Troy pound is 5,760 grains, and an Avoirdupois pound is 7,000 grains. In the words of the first Greek sophist, Protagoras (fifth century B.C.): ""Man is the measure of all things."" Whereas Protagoras meant this subjectively, to suggest that judgments are relative, it is better interpreted objectively, to express the nature of units of measurement.

Is it a coincidence that there are 3 pauli spin operators and 3 spatial dimensions?,3,2,False,False,False,Physics,1511064382,True,"Every two-state system has a state space that can be represented as a [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere), and for the spin 1/2 system it is easy to see that the three dimensions of the Bloch sphere correspond to the three spatial dimensions in which we live.

My question is, what happens in to a spin 1/2 system in a universe with two spatial dimensions? Or four? The Bloch sphere remains unchanged, but what interpretations do the three axes have now?

In addition, how do we interpret these axes for a two-state system in which the two states are not different orientations in space (e.g. lasers)?

Wikipedia's article on [doublet states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet_state) contains the sentence, 
&gt; Essentially all occurrences of doublets in nature arise from rotational symmetry; spin 1/2 is associated with the fundamental representation of the Lie group SU(2), the group that defines rotational symmetry in three-dimensional space.

I feel like somewhere here hidden in this statement is a deep truth about all two-state systems being rotationally symmetric, and not necessarily in three spatial directions at that.

I am aware of the relationship between SU(2) and SO(3), but the three dimensions in which we have rotational symmetry do not necessarily have to be spatial ones, do they?

If someone is unafraid to dive into how all of this changes in QFT I'd love to hear about that as well.

Breaking Water's Acid-Base Equilibirum,0,3,False,False,False,Physics,1511206007,True,I was reading [Ardo's paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435117301393) on ionic solar cells and found it extremely interesting. One conceptual pillar of the work is breaking the water acid-base equilibrium which they do using photoacids. I was wondering if there's a review on techniques for breaking water's acid-base equilibrium using something like a static electric field. Being able to do so would enable all kinds of weird water-as-semiconductor power devices in analogy to silicon.

Double major in Physics and Math worth it?,10,1,False,False,False,Physics,1511217059,True,"Hey currently I'm an undergraduate sophomore at Texas A&amp;M, and I've been doing very well in school. I don't want to sound like I have a big head or anything when I say this, but it's just I am doing well and I figure soon I gotta think about what I want to do with myself and I just really enjoy the science so it couldn't hurt to think ahead about grad school. My real question is, is it worth it to double major in math and physics? I feel like most of the real cool work I'll be doing personally probably will happen in grad school, so is it worth it to spend longer in undergrad, or possibly degrade my gpa? The thing is there is a lot of cool math concepts I want to get to know just to kinda ""add to my bag of tricks"" and I'm gonna definitely minor minor, but I just don't know how useful it would be to have the math major for someone going into grad school. Like I'm definitely taking extra courses because I want to, but would it do me much more to have another major under my belt, obviously it looks better, but is it worth it and am I missing out on anything?

I'm struggling to apply my layman's knowledge of relativity as a plot device, and could really use some analysis.

The tale involves our hero exploring the universe in a ship which can ~~exceed the speed of light~~ *approach light speed*.  He's pursuing a party of characters, each of whom are in identical vessels.  By zooming around chasing clues, he discovers them one by one, each long dead by the time he arrives.  The climax involves arriving in a final location to find the last party of his quarry alive.

All parties (hero, survivor, and deceased) start and stop their (near-C) journeys many times - independently and asynchronously - resting for days or weeks between (near-C) movements.  Quarry members meet and interact throughout their otherwise-separate journeys.  This is made possible by the same (fictional?) principle which allows the hero to meet a survivor at the end.

I'd like to better understand the real-world implications of this scenario.  What would have to be true for this to actually work?  *Would it just require both the pursuer and his surviving quarry to spend nearly identical amounts of time moving (near-C)?  What principles must be ignored to make the logic this simple?*  

*It would be really cool to have some insight into these concepts from anyone who better comprehends the mechanics involved.*

I *sincerely* appreciate your time and interest!  

Very very much obliged,

Have two questions. (Beating Gravity &amp; Different Masses in Free Fall),9,0,False,False,False,Physics,1511309639,True,"My grandfather and I were having a discussion on gravity and he said that gravity isn't strong because he can pick up a phone with a finger. I told him that he isn't beating gravity but instead beating the gravitational force on the object. I then told him that we ourselves can't beat gravity that's why we are still on the ground and it won't be possible for us, without  outside help. I then said that if masses are equal we must have a higher acceleration to beat gravity and as far as I know humans don't have natural acceleration therefore we can't beat gravity. He then said that why the moon is separating from the earth, but I told him it's different from linear because it involves angular motion.

So, my questions here are.

1. Can we beat gravity?

2. Is picking up an object beating gravity? Does that mean you are stronger than gravity?

3. Is the moon separating from the earth a different case because it has an angular velocity and acceleration?

He then said if you drop two objects to the ground the one with the bigger mass will hit first. He then said a car and a box. I told him you can't compare those they must have the same surface area. Assuming we have the same objects in surface area, shape, size, etc, but different masses they will hit the ground at the same time. Mass has no effect. I then told them in a vacuum two objects a feather and bowling ball are dropped and they reach the ground at the same time. In a vacuum this is due to no air resistance. Then I asked if mass effects air resistance.

So my question is.

1. Objects that are the exact same but different masses are dropped from free fall motion with no wind but air is present (not a vacuum) will they reach the ground at the same time?"

Path integral question,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1511353544,True,"Path integral is the integral over all possible paths from the initial state at t=0 to the final state at t = tau.

Do you have to slice the path in small parts and integrate over those (basically going backward in the demonstration of the path integral) or are there other ways?"

Quick question I’d like to ask.,5,2,False,False,False,Physics,1511357552,True,"So astronomers recently found this thing.

https://www.nasa.gov/feature/solar-system-s-first-interstellar-visitor-dazzles-scientists

According to the article at one point it was traveling at 196,000 miles per hour after being slingshot around our sun.

It’s big, estimates place it at 400 meters wide and possibly 4000 meters long. 

So my question is about energy, specifically how much energy this thing would have at its higher speed of 196,000 mph if it were to impact the Earth at that speed.

How much damage theoretically would such an object cause?

Demonstration of Condensed matter involving sound,3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1511357672,True,"Hello everybody,

For a course in condensed matter, we are allowed to make a demonstration of one of the phenomena discussed in the lectures. I attached the list below. 
I am thinking of a demonstration that also involves sound, as I am generally interested in sound already. There is some budget for the materials involved, and I am able to solder electronics. Anybody has any idea's for this? The demonstration should not last much longer than 5-10 minutes, and is meant for undergraduate (3rd year) physics students.

Here is the list of topics: 
* Einstein and Debye models for heat capacity of solids, vibrations of a mono-atomic linear chain.
* Vibrations of a diatomic linear chain, Tight-binding model in one dimension,
Electrons contribution to heat capacity of metals
* Wave propagation in complex media, Drude/Sommerfeld theory of electrons
* Geometry of solids, Energy bands
* Semiconductor crystals and devices
* Magnetism
* Superconductivity
* Nanostructures"

Is a GUT essentially a single Lagrangian invariant under one gauge group (which is then broken)?,5,13,False,False,False,Physics,1511421108,True,"In my class, we went over GWS electroweak theory and learnt we take a Lagrangian density locally invariant under U(1) x SU(2) and then break the SU(2) symmetry. We then went over the strong force and learnt that it comes from a Lagrangian (or the sum of the quark and gluon Lagrangians) that is locally invariant under SU(3). 

Is a Grand Unified Theory just a single Lagrangian (that contains the EM, weak, and strong interactions) locally invariant under some gauge group whose symmetry is is sequentially broken? The problem with my understanding is that I've seen the Standard Model stated as having the gauge group SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1). This seems to consolidate all three interactions.

My initial plan was to work for a year or two before reassessing whether or not I wanted to pursue a master's or PhD. The problem is I haven't been able to get a job. I've applied to countless science jobs (test engineers, research associates, etc at anywhere from national labs to industry companies) via indeed that accept any physics bachelor's. I've only had a few onsite interviews thus far in the many months I've been applying. I worked very hard in my undergrad studies to end up with a solid gpa and have some research experience. I don't want to sound entitled, but I can't help but feel a little gypped and frustrated about what I put in and got out of college. To be honest, I don't know what I'm doing wrong even though I clearly am. It's really been a bummer to me these past few months and I've lost a great deal of confidence and motivation as of late. Any tips here would be great. I'm mostly frustrated at myself for not knowing the job market well enough to plan things out better and set myself up for success. I'm frustrated that I didn't make more connections when I had the opportunity to do so.

I love science and would really like to stay in the field and contribute in some way.

Now I know we have no idea if these things actually exist, but let’s say you were somehow able to acquire one. Let’s put them in the format of portals like from the game portal. So you put one end of the wormhole into a spaceship and send it at near lightspeed around a black hole or something. Now according to the theory of relativity, the spaceship should experience slower time then everything else around it. If you have the other end of the wormhole on earth, and look into it, you should see time going by at a normal pace, right? What that mean that you are technically looking into the future? And furthermore, if you bring the spaceship back to earth after that and put the two ends of the wormhole next to each other, there should be a delay in time. It may be minor, but it is still a delay in time. Can someone please point out an error in this idea?

Do all electronics produce heat at the same efficiency?,16,1,False,False,False,Physics,1511643881,True,"I'm running a small crypto mining computer with someone. We have it running in my house.

We were both discussing the cost of electricity to run the computer, and how it ""costs less"" in the winter because the heat output of the computer saves on other heating costs. But we are not too sure just how far this goes. Obviously the computer generates heat as a result of the inefficiency of the computer, but is it as efficient as a purpose-built heater?

Were the computer 100% efficient, it would produce no outbound energy... but does that mean it would cost no electricity? If the electricity is not being ""turned into"" heat or radiation, it must stay within the computer. If it stays within the computer, that would mean that I could turn the computer on and unplug it from the wall, and it could continue working forever, right?

Conversely, an electric heater is designed to be very inefficient. It's meant to ""waste"" the electricity by turning it into heat.

Does that mean that when I use my computer, it is as efficient as an electric heater? Does it cost more to heat your house with computers than electric heaters? I believe that it would cost roughly the same. The electricity in the computer is either being used efficiently (in which case it gets reused by the computer or goes back into the grid), or it is not being used efficiently (in which case it is turned into heat/radiation).

If this is not the case, then where does that spent computer electricity go? The energy needs to go somewhere. If it's not being emitted as some form of radiation, and if it's not going back into the grid, then where is it being used?"

"Hey, can I ask just three small questions from a past (not very good) Physics student of 5 years;",10,1,False,False,False,Physics,1511661236,True,"1.) If light is massless then how come planets, stars and black holes can bend/‘trap’ it?

2.) Can something with mass ever be 0 Kelvin? 0K would mean matter should have NO energy, but because of‘mass-energy’ wouldn’t that mean that nothing with mass could ever be 0K?

3.) I’ve been hearing about gravitational wave discoveries sorta recently and that we can detect it here on earth after it happens, so would that mean gravity has a speed limit? I think it’d be the speed of light but I’m not sure why I think this, can you explain (if it has a speed limit or not), why?

Magnets Switching to New Polarities (I'm Stumped!),4,0,False,False,False,Physics,1511867200,True,"While not much of a scientist I like to think about how things work. Consequently, I had a shower thought that boggled my mind today - Redditors, won't you help me! 

I apologize if any of my thoughts are elementary and would appreciate any links to additional resources!

My thought is this: 

1. I have two magnets, one north facing pole that is facing a south pole, both being attracted to the other. Each pole is noted with a number and it's polarity.

(1+) &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; (2-) 

2. I throw in another magnet between these two. One that mimics the polarites of the ones already in play.

(1+) &gt;&gt; (3-)(4+) &lt;&lt; (2-)

Now I know that you cannot stop a magnetic force. There's not any material that could -completely- negate a magnetic field. For example; you can't put paper, or even your hand in between two magnets and have the magnetic field come to a stifled halt. But, does having a new magnet in between those two attracting ones make you have a new end-state pole? 

Simply, will the negative pole at position 2 stop being attracted to the positive pole at position 1 because it is now attracted to the new positive pole at position 4? Same goes with 1 and 3. And also, would the strength of the magnets make a difference? For example, if the magnet with poles 3 and 4 was weaker than the magnets with poles 1 and 2 would that make a difference? What if they were all equal?

Thanks for any references you can suggest or any answers you can provide!"

"Can you recommend good videos, youtube channels, or books, that can provide thorough explanations of complex physics topics without overly simplifying but also without the jargon?",9,4,False,False,False,Physics,1511913429,True,"Hi all,

I posted a similar question in the thread on the comic about quantum computing but I thought I'd make it it's own post.

Basically, I'm wondering Are there some good videos / channels / reads that do try to explain these concepts without overly simplifying stuff (other than academic journal articles or textbooks)? It is frustrating when you read or watch something and you understand it, only to find out that it's not actually how it works.

A few years ago, I got into a disagreement with a friend about the Twin Paradox. I even used a video by Neil Degrasse Tyson to demonstrate I was correct. Well, I wasn't correct, NDT (and others who try to explain the Twin Paradox) vastly overly simplify the problem. Pop-science makes it seem like the paradox is simply that going fast makes time move more slowly, which while interesting, isn't the paradox .

The 'paradox' (which if I now understand correctly, has been solved and is therefore not a paradox) is that with no absolute frame of reference each twin is accelerating away from each-other and back and so each twin should view the other as having aged less. However, the 'solution' is that the twins have two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey, and so there is no symmetry between the space-time paths of the twin. And thus, while I don't fully understand what's going on, I at least now know it's not as simple as going fast = time slows down.

I've found similar issues with people trying to explain the Heisenberg Uncertainty Problem and the Observer effect, which many people seem to just group into the same explanation (but if I'm correct now, they are not).  I've even heard Lawrence Krauss suggest this as well

Anyway, that whole rant is basically just to say, I thought at the time that NDT would give me a no-nonsense explanation. I've now learned (from this and other things he's said) that he's just trying to communicate to people who aren't very science literate and so his explanations aren't going to be as full and nuanced as I would like. And so, finding someone that I can trust to provide me with thorough explanations without the jargon.  It seems (and it would make sense) that most of the famous pop-physicists have to simplify many of these ideas in order to make them even remotely palpable to a wider audience.

(For context, I have PhD in psychology, but I only took first year undergrad physics, so I think I could grasp a nuanced explanation, but only if I can  understand the words being used)."
The universe as a thermal universal Turing machine,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1511915227,True,"This paper suggests the following:

We suggest and formalize an alternative approach to understand the universe in which a large blob of irreducible facts, rather than a small list of axioms, define the theory. The blob of facts is given a physical interpretation when it is structured as a Gibbs ensemble. In the case where the facts are logically verifiable, the Gibbs ensemble describes a thermal universal Turing machine which spawns the whole system. The Lagrange multipliers of the partition function are the Planck units. The background, a thermal spacetime, emerges as a consequence of the limits applicable to the conjugate pairs. The background obeys Special and General relativity, dark energy, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, the Schrödinger equation and the Dirac equation.

So using a latent heat figure of 340000 J/Kg, and a specific heat capacity of 4260J/deg.. we came up with the following equation... where m is the mass


340000/m + 29820m= 7304

To get rid of the /m we multiplied through by m

340000 + 29820m^2 =7304m

29820m^2 - 7304m + 340000= 0

For example, is it a guarantee that a neutrino and antineutrino will always annihilate when they come into contact with each other? Considering the fact that particle physics deals with particles, and particles obviously fall under the umbrella as things on the quantum level, I was thinking the Uncertainty Principle may effect the chances of particle, antiparticle annihilation.

A chin-up requires a constant force to fight gravity. By adding a chain, you can increase the mass in relation to the distance and make it a linearly increasing difficulty (F=(M+mx)g). By adding an elastic band, you can decrease the difficulty at the bottom but as you come up, the difficulty increases linearly once again (F=Mg+kx).  Is there any kind of system that decreases the difficulty at the top linearly? 

Edit: I don't know if this fits the rules of this sub, it's my first time here."

Acoustic Mean Free Path,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1512078992,True,"I've been reading about acoustics and I came across Sabine's approximation of the mean free path of a sound ray in a large chamber [;l_m = \frac{4V}{S};], which is basically an approximation for the average distance between two points on the surface of any 3D enclosed space.

However when I wanted to calculate (numerically) the same MFP from a unit cube using statistics I got some pretty weird results... If [; F_{X_i^2}(x) = 1/\sqrt{4x} ;] is used to denote the PDF of the square of an evenly distributed variable on the interval [0,1] the mean free path should be:

[; l_m = 3 \int_0^1 (\sqrt{y+1} + \sqrt{y}) (F(y) * F(y)) dy ;]

So this is an integral over the surface of the unit cube of the function [; \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} ;], where  F(y)*F(y) is the convolution, but It doesn't seem to work.

What am I missing?

If fisson is breaking apart tge nucleus and generates energy then surely fusion, joining the nuclei together consumes energy?

Why can't protons beta-decay to neutrons?,5,1,False,False,False,Physics,1512108135,True,"We know that an isolated neutron is unstable and will beta-decay into a proton, electron, and anti-electron neutrino through a virtual W^- -boson converting one of the d-quarks into an u-quark. 


But there is nothing (apparent to me) in the standard model that prevents me from writing down a process in which a proton can beta-decay into a neutron, positron, and electron neutrino through a similar process but with a W^+ -boson instead. 


I can understand that an isolated u-quark will never transform into a d-quark through some off-shell W-boson interaction. However, quarks inside hadrons (or anywhere as far as we could tell) are never isolated and are interacting a lot with all of the other quarks and gluons inside that hadron (or some other phase of QCD matter). So who is to say that in the non-perturbative regime the mass of the quark is such that such an exchange could occur?

Moment of Inertia’s Relationship to Volume,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1512192806,True,"On Youtube a video titled “Walter Lewin Demonstrates moment of Inertia” on the Physics World channel, Mr. Lewin says the longer and shorter (in length) cylinders (with identical radii, and both solid) arrive at the same time when rolled down an angled plank.

However, I couldn’t help but notice the longer cylinder arriving before the shorter one at time 07:02 to 07:03. Their distance increases as they accelerate down the plank.

Per Lewin’s description of kinetic energy density being higher in solid cylinders than hollow cylinders, the shorter solid cylinder would have less energy density and so be slower than a solid cylinder with more volume (be longer or thicker). 

Hence his conjecture in the video should be corrected to state that the total volume of an object is relates to it’s kinetic energy instead of just comparing merely solid vs hollow. 

Perhaps he’s oversimplifying to appeal to young teenage audiences, but accuracy and correctness are just as important :)

"Decided I want a degree in physics, how should I prepare myself before classes start in January?",4,1,False,False,False,Physics,1512256317,True,"A bit about me: I'm 27 and dropped out of a communications program at college a year ago to attend a programming bootcamp.

However, I see several potential roadblocks to this that I hope to gain insight into. First of all, my experience with anything math-related is embarrassingly small, especially given the field I am in. I was homeschooled and was taught only very basic algebra and geometry. In community college I took algebra but that was 5 years ago. I am confident in my ability to learn; my coding bootcamp really showed me what I am capable of if I apply myself in the right environment but I know that the odds are stacked against me.

[Data Analysis] Is there a standardized way to determine the point at which a distribution begins to increase? (Details in text).,8,2,False,False,False,Physics,1512262951,True,"I'm doing an experiment on the photoelectric effect and am measuring the relationship between light wavelengths produced by a lamp and the current that is excited by these emitted photons.

However, the lamp my experiment uses produces a *spectrum* of light where the intensities form a bell-curve distribution centered at the desired wavelength set by the user.

Therefore when I get a measurement of an increased current from a specific setting on my lamp, it means that the threshold wavelength is the point leftmost of my spectrum where the intensity just begins to increase from some constant (albeit noisy) baseline corresponding to zero.

Now, I used an equipment that would propel the balls by hitting them from the back with a metal rod that was attached to it. How far they went depended not only the size and component but also the amount of force used to push it off. Some of the results went as I expected, the lighter balls went farther and the heavier balls landed faster, but there was one where the lighter balls reached the ground sooner and had a shorter distance.

Acceleration,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1512367715,True,"Hi guys,
So, I am doing this homework problem where there is a ruler attached to a pivot. This is basically the description: https://gyazo.com/5f5cb8e3c5c3f9ccda690f49b794f7d2

So, I was just a bit confused on a question where it asks, what the tangential acceleration of the ruler is, while the hand is pushing, but before the ruler begins to move. Even if the ruler does not move, is it possible for it to have tangential acceleration? Also, at the instant the hand has stopped pushing, is the tangential acceleration nonzero and directed perpendicular, but along in the plane of the page?


The letter in parenthesis are what I think the answer is to the question.
Choices for the Questions:

A. Zero

B. not zero and directed into the page

C. not zero and directed out of the page

D. not zero and directed along the ruler

E. not zero and directed perpendicular to the ruler but in the plane of the page

Question 1: While the hand is pushing, but before the ruler begins to move, the tangential acceleration of the ruler is ___. (A)

Question 2:While the hand is pushing, but before the ruler begins to move, the centripetal acceleration of the ruler is ___. (A)

(My reasoning for these first three questions is, since the ruler is not moving, there is no change in angular velocity so acceleration would be 0)

Question 3: While the hand is pushing, but before the ruler begins to move, the angular acceleration of the ruler is__. (B)

(My reasoning for question 3 is that there is a net torque even though the ruler is not moving, but I am just basing off the direction by what it would be if the ruler actually moved which I do not know if it is correct or not)

Question 4: At the instant the hand has stopped pushing, the tangential acceleration of the ruler is ___. (E)

Question 5: At the instant the hand has stopped pushing, the centripetal acceleration of the ruler is___. (D)

Question 6: At the instant the hand has stopped pushing, the angular acceleration of the ruler is ___. (A)

(There is no net torque, so there is no angular acceleration??)

Question 7: At the instant the hand has stopped pushing, the angular velocity of the ruler is ___.(B)"

Question Can venturi based wind power generation actually work?,8,44,False,False,False,Physics,1512480731,True,"Hi I have a question regarding windenergy,

In my municipality in the Netherlands there is a discussion about how to generate sustainable energy. Due to some people not liking regular windturbines an alternative device was brought up: A venturi based wind generator. [The device and process are described here](http://sheerwind.com/technology/how-does-it-work) and [this is a prototype](https://www.windenergie-magazine.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Invelox.png) that they have put on a roof. Apparently it can move into the wind direction.

Now I am a bit sceptical about this but I am in now way an expert. it sounds almost too good to be true. While I know that you can increase the speed of a flow by narrowing a pipe, I am 1. not sure if such a system would be as efficient in open air and 2. if the principle itself would indeed be better for energy production.

Also what makes me a bit suspicious, is that no one seems to be able to tell me how much power it generates. People are only talking about how much the speed increases.

Is there anyone here who can tell me if this concept could theoretically have merit?"

Acceleration: Force Based vs Position Based?,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1512503777,True,"A 3 axis accelerometer measures force using capacitive plates and a mass, then uses F=ma to derive the acceleration. In my intro to physics course, we learned that the derivative of position is velocity and the derivative of velocity is acceleration. So, if I measure a system using motion tracking and simultaneously with an accelerometer, intuitively, I know the acceleration has to be the same, but the plots of motion based acceleration look very different from force based acceleration. 

I suppose it's because of a the frame of reference for motion tracking is world based and accelerometer is self based and that the accelerometer would include a constant gravity vector.

Like math, a lot of this stuff builds on itself and now that we are doing rotational motion I want to make sure I understand the previous concepts before trying to pipe on top of a shaky foundation.

I feel good about the basics of Newtons laws and linear motion (mostly) but got lost after that. 

I have less than a week until my final and could really use some help. Thanks!

-----

Edit:

The main issue I am having is knowing which equations to use and how to plug in one equation into another in order to solve stuff like velocity from PE etc.  Some of the topics we have covered so far are the first 12 chapters of Halliday &amp; Resnick Fundamentals of Physics:

1-5 - I feel moslty good about these subjects and did well on the first exam (83%):

1. Measurement

2. Motion Along a Straight Line

3. Vectors

4. Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

5. Force and Motion I (Intro to Newtons Laws)

6-9 - This is where I got lost and I bombed my second exam (61%):

6. Force and Motion II (Friction, Drag Force)

7. Kinetic Energy and Work

8. Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

9. Center of Mass and Linear Momentum

10-12 - Last topics for the term, will need solid understanding of these as well as 6-9 for final:

10. Rotation

11. Rolling, Torque, and Angular Momentum

12. Equilibrium and Elasticity (more on equilibrium mostly)

My personal feeling is that the book doesn't go over the concepts very well and we are assigned ~30 problems from each chapter, each with several parts which takes me countless hours to complete and a lot of frustration making me resort to Student Solutions and Chegg with hopes I will understand from seeing/copying the solutions.  The problems seem a lot harder than what is reviewed in the text also.  This book seems to be highly regarded though so it is likely a me problem.

According to this article detectors D1,D2,D3,D4 are distant from 2 slits than D0. Therefore photon arrives at D0 sooner.

But since photon hasn't yet arrived at other (D1,D2 or D3,D4) detectors, it doesn't show an interference pattern at D0.

According to the article, it's only after it has arrived at either D1,D2 or D3,D4 detectors would photon shows an interference pattern or a simple diffraction pattern.

My question is what is shown in D0 in the meantime ? That is while photon reaches D1,D2 or D3,D4 ?
Does it shows a simple diffraction pattern at first and change it into an interference pattern after if photon arrived at D1,D2 ?"

I wanted to see if there are any resources out there that could cater to my situation, or whether I would just be better off working through textbooks again. I've had up through Calculus 2, Linear Algebra, and taken cal based physics for kinematics, mechanics, E&amp;M, and Modern Physics for stuff like relativity. I know I would need to expand my Calculus to learn differential equations and the other subjects that come with Cal 3.

I am a PhD student that is fundamentally somewhere between a biologist and a chemist, both in experience and knowledge. In the course of my research, I've ended up at a point where I need to learn continuum mechanics for biology.


Suffice to say I have no background. In mechanics (other than knowing what stress and strain basically are), or in any type of physics beyond high school.


I've been looking for books, but am honestly overwhelmed and have turned to reddit for advice. I am willing to learn anything; I just need the following:


1) A place to learn the mathematical basis for this, where there are visual representations for things. My biggest struggle with math is conceptually following what is happening along with the jargon on the page. If I can't see it in my head, I can't understand it.
I know that continuum mechanics is probably not appropriate for someone who struggles with math, but I really don't have a choice (and ""quit grad school"" is not an option).
So I would honestly prefer something that is approachable for beginners and explains concepts in a way where I can really understand them.


2) A place to learn whatever physics I should know in order to be able to understand continuum mechanics. 


I know this is very vague... I don't know what I don't know, and that makes guiding myself even more difficult. 
Thank you in advance for your suggestions and reading material -everything from online courses to textbooks would be useful to me, and I am honestly just looking for something that I can understand.

I want to take a solid proof based math class, something I have never really encountered in my education. Is a knowledge of proofs something that is useful beyond math?

About double majoring/minoring in math or applied math (course requirements) for physics major,19,6,False,False,False,Physics,1512624339,True,"Hello, I am a freshman in college seeking to major physics (I will declare next semester). My ultimate goal is to become an astrophysicist (particularly interested in extragalactic astronomy, cosmology, neutron stars, pulsars, exoplanets, all that good stuff). 
My college does not offer the option of 'astronomy/astrophysics' degree and I was told that pursuing physics degree with a thought of going to grad school in astrophysics is not a bad idea at all so I decided to pursue physics degree. However, there is a space science minor available which is additional 5 classes (around 15 credit hours) and I will also pursue that. Adding up all the required credit hours for physics major and space science minor, it is around 80-85 credit hours and since my college has no core curriculum, I can pretty much do anything I want with all those 40-45 credit hours left.
I am thinking of either double majoring in math or applied math, or even minoring in any of those. (I am slightly considering CS minor as well. Not as a major though.) As I look through the course catalog, I am not sure if which one would be beneficial for me as pursuing astrophysics.

For Math minor, I need to take only 2 more additional classes (without any restriction except that they have to be 300-level or above) since I will be done with Calc 1, 2, 3, Lin Alg, diff eq when I finish requirements for physics degreeand if I would take 2 classes, it would probably be one of: complex analysis, analysis 1, advanced algebra, partial diff eq. 

For Math Major, I only need to take 4 more additional classes but there is some restriction: 
Advanced Algebra I (or Honors)

Analysis I (or Honors)

Choose one from: Elementary Number Theory

or Honors Algebra II

or Introduction To Topology

or Representation Theory

or Lie Groups for Undergraduates

Choose one from:

Methods of Complex Analysis	

or Analysis II

or Honors Complex Analysis

or Introduction To Topology

or Honors Analysis II

or Partial Differential Equations with Applications

or Dynamical Systems

or Introduction Calculus of Variations

or Introduction To Differential Geometry

or Calculus on Manifolds

or Fourier Analysis

And if I were to either minor or major in math, I am not sure which one would be a little bit more useful and if I were to major in math, I have no clue how I should choose from those selections to benefit me the most in understanding of astrophysics.

For applied math major, I need to additionally take 7 more courses:

Intro to Computing (Python, Matlab/Mathematica, UNIX)

Discrete Math

Intro to Probs

Intro to Stats

Intro to Optimization

(these three 'intro' classes are notorious to be very difficult in my college)

Completing 2 courses from area of focus

For applied math minor, I just basically do not have to take 2 courses from area of focus and I also do not have to take discrete math so it is 4 additional classes.

Which major/minor or whatever combination might help me the best? I tried talking to various professors and my peers but they didn't really help that much since they just ended up saying 'it is up to you to decide.' That is true, but can you give me some concrete advice on what might be the best option? 

This might have been really long and I appreciate whoever read this til the end &lt;3"
Is Dark Matter the Ether?,178,0,False,False,False,Physics,1512634941,True,"We know Dark Matter exists. When two galaxies collide the Dark Matter continues by inertia, creating gravitational lensing outside the boundary of the galaxy, similar to a crash test dummy flying through the windshield of a car. 

This also implies a kind of fluid dynamics of Dark Matter - it ebbs, flows and swirls.

Meanwhile:

1) Experiments in Pilot Wave Theory are increasingly indicating a deterministic explanation for double slit experiment. An explanation that necessitates some kind of Universal background field - an ""ether"".

2) Red shift can be explained by ""tired light"" which if 1 is true, is a logical hypthesis. Of course a wave loses energy while passing through the background field - why wouldn't it? Afterall, the sky would be entirely whited out with light at all times if this were not the case. This lost energy accumulates within the background field - giving ""dark matter"" its mass which has proven gravitational attraction.

3) slowing of time as it approaches light speed is an artifact of the way we observe movement; there is nothing even remotely mysterious about this. It's an illusion. For example, if we ""saw"" with echolocation similar to bats, we would also observe objects to slow as they approach the speed of sound, and just like red shift, those objects ""sound signature"" would also deform while approaching speed of sound. We hear this ourselves when a siren passes us. Again this is simply an illusion created by how our senses process the data from our perspective. It's not mysterious - not even a little bit.

What about the Morley experiment? It was a false negative. Because Dark Matter / Ether behaves similar to fluid dynamics - clinging around mass, as has already been shown - it also swirls with rotating bodies similar to the Earths atmosphere. Denying Ether exists because Morley experiment was not positive is exactly like denying air exists because air does not whip us in the face at 10,000 miles per hour while the Earth rotates.  

Please discuss.

""Can electricity enter our body through the flash of a  digital camera?

Yes 100% it can happen. 

This is a true incident, which happened with a 21 year old boy studying engineering. 

He died in Keshwani Hospital. He was admitted in the hospital in burnt conditions.

The reason:: He went to Amrawati on a study tour.  While coming back, he was waiting for train at railway station along with his friends. 

Many of them were taking group photo in their mobiles with digital cameras.

This boy was also there and trying to take group photo. From where he was standing, he couldn't  cover the group. So he went a little back. 

The place where he was standing, an electric wire with 40,000 volt was running  atop.

As soon as he pressed the button of digital camera, the electricity of 40,000 volt
entered the camera through the flash, then the fingers and then the whole body.

All this happened in a few seconds. 50% of his body was burnt. In that condition he was brought to Keshwani Hospital, and then to Mumbai in an ambulance. 
He was unconscious for 1 and 1/2 days. As his body was 50% burnt, doctors were having less hope for him. Later on he died"""
How do you feel about common but imprecise/wrong statements in Physics?,21,20,False,False,False,Physics,1512643188,True,"There are many statements in books which are not totally correct. I understand that it is difficult and not always convenient to be 100% precise, but I feel that sometimes it's just laziness or ignorance.

It seems okay to me to work with delta functions and Hilbert spaces in QM without introducing rigged Hilbert spaces and I guess we can assume that a smooth L2 function tends to zero at infinity, although it does not need to. But I think obtaining the classical limit by taking h→0 or N→∞ would require some additional comments about coherent states or when we use Huygens principle in 2D, it should be mentioned why it shouldn't work but more or less does.

Project: Measuring the Earth's Radius,4,3,False,False,False,Physics,1512736886,True,"I've been thinking of doing this little personal project, measuring the earth's radius. I will be traveling back to my hometown which is about 750km from where I currently am. 

So what I'll do is, at noon, 12PM, I will set a ruler (with length L) upright and measure the length of the shadow (S). 
You can see this as a right triangle with base S and height L. The angle (X) formed between the hypotenuse and L will be arc-tangent of S/L.

I will do this measurements here, where I am right now, and in my hometown which is about 750 km away from here.

With some assumptions made, I conclude that the difference in angle X between both locations is equal to the difference in angular position with respect to the center of the earth. Knowing that, I can use the relation that the arc distance (750 km) is equal to the angular position difference in radians (measured) times the radius of the Earth.

The assumptions made are:

- The difference in angle between both positions and the sun is negligible.

- The tilt in Earth's axis is ignored.

- The sun's position in the sky doesn't change for the same time in a day even though the measurements are weeks apart.

Question about degrees of freedom of quantum systems.,8,10,False,False,False,Physics,1512744281,True,"Suppose you have a spin 1/2 system. It can be either in a spin up (1, 0) or down state (0, 1), or a complex superposition thereof (a +bi, c + di). If we consider solutions to the time-independent Hamiltonian, the physical state is invariant to a phase change, we might as well demand the spin up coefficient to be real (i.e. b = 0), so basically we have three *real* degrees of freedom. Is this correct?

Suppose that now we have two interacting spin 1/2 systems. Now we have 4 complex coefficients, corresponding to 8 real coefficients. Of the complex coefficients, we can only set one to a real number, which leaves 7 real degrees of freedom.

Is it true that for a system of n interacting spin 1/2 subsystems, the number of real degrees of freedom of the state is 4n-1? That would be quite different from any classical system, where there is no offset in the number of degrees of freedom."

Change the way intro physics is taught?,114,140,False,False,False,Physics,1512755367,True,"So, I've been thinking about dramatically changing the way I go through physics content. The kind of ""canon"" order I see is:

- mechanics (kinematics, forces, circular motion, energy, momentum, rotations, harmonic motion)

- waves (sound and other mechanical waves, usually)

- E&amp;M

- light/optics

- modern physics

With a smattering of thermo or fluids or other topics, if there's time, depending on if it's high school or college. I think, though, this creates a separation between common threads where there shouldn't be. For instance: dealing with an electric field, from a conceptual perspective of what a field is, is no different from dealing with a gravitational field. The equations even look very similar! But students don't see it that way, I think, because the topics are usually months apart, so they think they're unrelated.

So, to solve that problem, I propose the following order:

- forces (specifically discussing the four fundamental forces, at least on a conceptual level)

- kinematics

- uniform circular motion, gravitation/Kepler's Laws

- Coulomb's Law

- energy (kinetic energy, gravitational potential, spring potential, electric potential; maybe thermo here)

- electric circuits

- harmonic motion (waves, sound, light waves) 

- momentum (collisions/explosions, momentum of photons)

- optics

- modern (relativity &amp; quantum)

In this way, I think we can lump all the stuff that looks like they aren't related together, so the artificial barriers don't get created (or aren't as hard to burst through, anyway). In my mind, it goes ""what causes things to change,"" ""what happens when they do change,"" ""what's lying underneath the change (energy)"", ""what happens when things interact,"" and then focusing on the weirdness of light, especially when it comes to wave-particle stuff or relativity/quantum stuff. 

What do you think? Barring some quibbles with particular topics being in certain places, do you think this would be worth trying out somewhere? What are the disadvantages I'm missing from doing it this way (outside of departmental inertia and that it might cost more time than is already available)?

Perhaps the universe is creating energy...,11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1512773855,True,"It’s widely accepted that the universe started with a ‘big bang’. First there was nothing, and then a burst of energy and light and other stuff, which slowly turned into billions of planets and stars and lifeforms; living, breathing, reading lifeforms; people, who have the ability to change the universe they reside in with every action they make. Life spawned from nothingness after a few billion years… and now there are many of us.

In my view, the only possibility for the extreme vastness of our universe is that our universe is an energy-creating machine! Whether it had the energy previously or not, it still managed to spawn billions of galaxies, evolving lifeforms, and certain things which seem to go on forever: e.g. light, gravity, time, evolution.

Yes, I know some of you would immediately argue that the laws of Conservation of Energy would determine my view to be impossible. But then I would argue that by definition, our Universe could have conserved energy by simply receiving energy from a neighboring dimension. Perhaps we get a glimpse of this energy generation process via black holes and the expansion of space.

If the universe is creating energy… it might be possible for us humans to do the same.

Question about biomechanics,12,10,False,False,False,Physics,1512836865,True,"Hey everybody. Im trying to program an active ragdoll animation system for my game, and ive been stuck on this for a while now:

Im applying torques to bodyparts, to orient them to certain orientations based on a series of factors. However when im applying torque, i only take into account the desired orientation and muscle's strength, nothing more. This result in things looking artifical, like forces are coming from outside, like some invisible hand is acting on bodyparts. I.E. when ragdoll starts to fall from upright position, its fall is slowed down, etc., which is understandable why that happens. What i cant understand is how to make that not happen :) 

As far as i understand, when muscles contract, they apply the same force/torque to BOTH body parts that are connected to the muscle.

Help understanding Hawking’s Radiation,20,0,False,False,False,Physics,1512847314,True,"At my current understanding of Hawking’s radiation, I understand that the strong gravitational field near a singularity has the ability to pull apart the “quantum foam” of the universe long enough to separate particals and their antiparticals, one of which leaves the black hole via quantum tunnelling and the other falls in. Since the gravitational field put in the energy to create two particals and only recieved one in return, there is a net loss of energy, thus leading to the decay of the black hole.

Where I am lost is that the partical tunnelling out of the black hole appears to have defied the law of conservation of energy if it leaves the black hole. Consider a partical’s potential energy near the singularity. Now consider the particals energy near the event horizon. The potential energy of the partical has seemingly increased exponentially. Is the energy somehow conserved in this example in a way that I am not seeing or is energy being created?

Alternatively, if the partical can only tunnel to other positions of equal potential, that limits the possible locations to exclusively other black holes, which if being done throughout the entire universe, means that the net energy loss of black holes should be zero.

Entanglement and Bells Theorem,8,3,False,False,False,Physics,1512857230,True,"I'm trying to understand how Bell's Theorem precludes the possibility that entangled particles have their (whatever) values set when they become entangled.   

As I understand it, when particles are entangled, they can be separated, then a property (e.g. spin) can be measured, and whatever is measured on particle A, the opposite must be measured on particle B.  As I understand it, the Copenhagen interpretation tells us that before the measurement, A and B are in an entangled state, and they have no values for spin until the measurement of one of the particles, at which point the wave function collapses, and the particle measured gets a value with some probability.

What I'm missing is what is wrong with the interpretation that at the moment the particles are entangled, they have their spin values set then? As I understand it, this is almost exactly the same as the copenhagen interpretation, as at the point of measurement you still don't know what you are going to get, so you will 50/50 see either of the opposite possible values.  The only difference is that the values are set at the moment of entanglement, and not when measurement takes place.

I read somewhere that this is equivalent to a hidden variable arguments, which Bell's inequality specifically precludes.   

Why? If someone could explain the Bell's Inequality argument is simple detail, that would be AWESOME.  Please go easy on me, not a physicist, just intensely curious.  I almost asked in the ELI5 sub but decided to go for it here.  Thanx in advance."

Black Hole Powered Hydrogen Fusion Engine?,11,0,False,False,False,Physics,1512895879,True,"So I was watching a video about internal combustion engines at like 1 in the morning over Thanksgiving. All of sudden an idea came to me for a hypothetical black hole powered hydrogen fusion engine. Keep in mind my whole idea is a thought experiment that would be impossible to carry out with today's technology. 

So imagine a black hole. We build a ring around the black hole rotating at extreme speeds. It's relatively close but strong enough not to be ripped to shreds. Inside the ring are pistons. As the ring rotates, hydrogen gas from the black hole's accretion disk enters through input valves. The intense gravity of the black hole pulls the pistons inward with massive force, as does the centrifugal forces in the ring. This force could be great enough to cause the hydrogen to fuse in a thermonuclear explosion. This, like a miniature supernova, flings the piston back, allowing for massive amounts of work to be done. Keep in mind that this structure would need to be extremely large. Like, the pistons would need to be larger than mountains. But it would work sorta like a car engine, just with millions of times larger and more powerful. The ring itself would likely be at least hundreds of kilometers around, so there would be tens of thousands of thermonuclear reactions going on every moment. The amount of energy this could release would be immense. If you could hook it up to a massive computer, it would be godlike in intelligence. Or you could harness the energy for basically anything else. It's probably a fundamentally flawed idea, but it's a cool thought experiment. Thoughts? Opinions? "

Classical mechanics was by far my favorite subject (this stuff: http://www.uscibooks.com/tay2con.htm). Is there any place for this kind of stuff in physics nowadays? It does not seem like it to me (there is some stuff with chaos and nonlinear dynamics). Also, I definitely want to go to grad school, but afterward I do not see myself going into academia (maybe not a research career at all). I want to work with modern defense and/or space technology in some way, likely on the R&amp;D side of things. 

All of this makes me think physics is not the place for me and that my interest in classical mechanics and aerospace and defense technology would be more at home in AeroE or MechE. However, I do like physics and I don't want to get away from it. I just want to find an avenue that combines my interest in classical physics (mainly mechanics, but I like EM alright as well) with my interest in aerospace and defense.

Question concerning photon energy in moving square well,0,1,False,False,False,Physics,1512948268,True,"Please help correct any place I've misunderstood this problem, I'm trying to model a photon in a moving infinite square well. If a photon is trapped in a stationary infinite square well, it must terminate at the edges of the well. This makes it a standing wave, which can be represented as a superposition of two waves with opposite and equal momenta. If the well is moving, the photon's wavefunction can still terminate at the edges of the well. The wavefunction will be represented as a superposition of two waves with different momenta. 

I've made an interactive photon in a box to show how this might work (c=1):
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3tsuuxczin

This only works if the probability of measuring the photon in the lower momentum state is the same as the higher momentum state, which seems strange. If the box is moving in the +x direction, then the lower momentum is directed in the -x direction and the higher +x. The speed of light is constant, and if the photon is treated like a classical particle, it will spend less time with the lower momentum than higher momentum. This is because the high energy photon must catch up to the side of the box which is moving away from it and the low energy photon is moving in the opposite direction of the box, so it will collide with it sooner. If the photon spends more time with high momentum than low momentum, I will be more likely to measure it with high momentum than low momentum. This goes against the necessary assumption to model it as I did in desmos: I am equally likely to measure it in either momentum state. 

So which is it? Are the probabilities of the photon being measured in the high state different or the same as the low state? Where am I misunderstanding the problem I've presented (probably eigenvalues...)? 

Thanks!"

My ultimate goal is to become an astrophysicist and that means I have a goal of going to astrophysics grad school. In that preparation, as an undergrad freshman, I am a physics major and I got a research position next semester so I can get some hands-on experience in researching with astrophysics. I will also continue to take some elective astrophysics courses starting next sem (intro to astronomy) and fulfill the physics degree requirement as well.

However, I am concerned if this option of 'grad school' or just going into academia in general, won't turn out well. Therefore, I just want to have a backup plan in the case where grad school option doesn't go well. That is why I want to double major in CS. Double majoring in Physics and CS is not terribly difficult and I can still graduate in 4 yrs, thanks to the lack of core curriculum (gen ed requirements) in my school. I just need to take 32 additional credits in CS (as a B.A. option instead of B.S.) + discrete math and I will be able to fulfill CS degree requirement as well. For my physics degree, it is around 70 credits (since I have AP Calc AB/BC credit and AP Chem Credit) so theoretically, I still have some space to do something else. 

People have been consistently telling me that as a physicist, minor in CS is enough, but for me, I just want to have a backup plan and I want some help with this. Will double major in Physics and CS be a good backup plan? Or should I just stick with the minor? Or should I consider some other double major? Or should I just solely focus on grad school admissions?

- Quantum mechanics says that matter has a base quantum energy state (and cannot be cooled to a lower state than that), which is higher than absolute zero (for this reason, for example, Helium cannot freeze at standard pressure no matter how much its cooled).

Do the two effects combine, and it's the quantum energy state which can never be reached, just approached asymptotically? Or can matter be cooled exactly down to its base quantum energy state, just not lower? "

"Someone asked me this question recently, and I was shocked to discover that it stumped me...",16,3,False,False,False,Physics,1513209556,True,"Imagine you have two identical ring-shaped space stations. When rotating at a certain speed, people standing inside the rim will experience the equivalent of one gee (ignore Coriolis etc for this example).

The axis of both stations falls on the same line, they are initially stationary with respect to one another, and they're sufficiently far apart that neither has any significant effect on the other's position or movement.

Now, spin one station up to speed and leave the other station at rest. People on the spinning ring will experience one gee at the rim. People on the rim of the other wheel will be free-floating.

Now, enclose both stations in an opaque shell that is uniformly black and featureless on the inside (a flat-black Dyson sphere, if you like). As much as is physically possible, no external signals can penetrate to the interior of the shell. From within the shell, it's effectively impossible to judge from a distance whether the shell is rotating or stationary, much less the rest of the universe outside.

During a routine space walk, you bonk your head while loading a crate of Tang into an airlock and briefly pass out. When you come to, you find yourself halfway between the two stations. The blow you received imparted some spin, and each station looks to be rotating in opposite directions at roughly equal speed. These stations were mass-produced, and you can't visually distinguish the spinning station from the one at rest.

From your point of view, each is spinning at roughly the same speed, but in opposite directions. If ITT Technical Institute has taught you anything, it's that motion is relative, and no one frame of reference is any more valid than any other.

Yet the people on one of these stations are walking around doing useful work, while people on the other are flailing around in zero gee and bouncing off of each other. ""That doesn't seem right"", you think to yourself. If you consider yourself to be at rest (and the rest of the universe isn't providing any clues at the moment to confirm or deny that point of view), then you should be able to match your spin to either station, puff your way over there and experience the same fraction of one gee, no matter which station you pick.

_I feel like I'm missing something obvious, but I couldn't answer this question._ _Why would it still be possible to detect whether you were spinning relative to the rest of the universe, even if the universe was completely hidden or empty?_ _What makes one frame of reference **behave** differently from the other?_"

Insolation &amp; Eccentricity,5,3,False,False,False,Physics,1513266946,True,"Here's a fun problem I've been pondering for the last few days. The answer appears to be somewhat counterintuitive, so I'm looking for some kind of intuitive explanation for why it must be true. Let me know if you've got anything.  

Question: **how does the eccentricity of Earth's orbit affect the total amount of sunlight absorbed in a given year (annual insolation)?**  

[THIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04542) article seems to suggest that annual insolation increases in proportion to 1/sqrt(1–e^(2)), which is corroborated [HERE](https://www.skepticalscience.com/Milankovitch.html). I find this really counterintuitive, though. My instinct tells that that either (1) the perfectly circular orbit maximizes annual insolation, or that (2) annual insolation remains constant as eccentricity varies. (Weaker sunlight at aphelion, but you spend more time there; stronger sunlight at perihelion, but you spend less time there.)  

I've been trying to solve this one analytically, but my math chops aren't what they used to be. [HERE'S](https://imgur.com/tq2hFNl) what I've got so far, but I hit a brick wall with the integral at the end. Any bright ideas on how to proceed? I'd also love to hear if anybody has some slick, intuitive explanation for why a highly eccentric orbit would capture the most annual sunlight.

People who are completely unrelated to my studies, family, childhood/school friends etc. have no interest in it and I have nothing to share and disscuss with them when it comes to physics.

Torque question physics,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1513293929,True,"Question: Sphere moves upward on an inclined plane with a 30 degree tilt angle. At the base of the ramp the mass center of the sphere has a transport speed of 10m / s. What is the maximum distance the ball will reach up the ramp? Is given g = 10 m / s2 and the compact moment of inertia I = 2/5 mR^2
_____________________________________________________
Answer: Assuming no slipping, Conservation of energy applies 
Initial energy = final energy 
KE_translational + Ke_rotational = PE 
1/2*m*v^2 + 1/2*I*w^2 = m*g*h 

Linear angular velocity relationship 
W = v/r 

Sub that and I in 
1/2*m*v^2 + 1/2*(2/5 * m * r^2 ) * ( v/r )^2 = mgh 

Solve for h 
1/2*v^2 + 1/5*v^2 = g*h =&gt;
H = (7v^2 ) / (10g) =&gt;
H = (7 * 10^2 )/(10 * 10) =&gt;
H = 7 meters

Convert to length 
L = H/sin(theta) = 14 meters 

So the sphere moved up 7 m and it moved 14 m along the ramp.

So my question is, it asks for the maximum distance of the ball will reach up the ramp. Why the conversation tho from height to length? Why the answer isn't just 7 meters and we find 2 different distances (as the question asks for only one distance)?
Moreover, is the solution the correct? Thanks alot."

_______________________________________________________
I didnt know what to do. I just done this which shows max angle θ where the cylinder will stay immobile and wont slip:
f=μ * Ν = μ * mgcosθ
so, mgsinθ - μ * mgcosΘ = 0 =&gt;
-μ * mgcosθ = - mgsinθ =&gt;
μ = mgsinθ/mgcosθ =&gt;
μ = tanθ.................

I tried to solve like this mgsinθ - μ * mgcosΘ &lt; 1/3 but the result was -μ&lt;1/3 - tanθ.....which doesnt show anything.

Why does an open car window make a helicopter sound?,9,12,False,False,False,Physics,1513302062,True,"Is there a name to this phenomenon of a large opening in an enclosed space vibrating this way? Is it related to how reed instruments make music? If the opening is smaller, it does not make the sound. If there are two windows open, it also does not make the sound. I know vaguely why it does this, but I want to know how to learn more about it. "
Hearing sound from 4D-Space?,13,3,False,False,False,Physics,1513302411,True,"During a discussion with a friend of mine, the topic of sound propagation in different dimensions came up. The idea was that of a higher-dimensional being (4D for simplicity) trying to 'verbally' communicate with us, and whether we could perceive this attempted interaction. (Understanding the words, on the other hand, would be a whole different matter.)

My guess was: yes, because sound is pressure waves travelling through a medium, and creatures in an arbitrarily dimensioned space will have a medium for it to travel through. Moreover, since 3D-space would be a tiny 'slice' through their 4D-space, the higher-dimensional space actually *contains* the lower-dimensional one. So the sound would travel through our 3D-slice 'as usual'.
However, in case I'm correct, I would like to back that assertion up with some actual data rather than pure intuition. Otherwise, feel free to correct me!

**As such, my question is two-fold:**

* Would a 2D-creature be able to notice our (3-dimensional) attempts to verbally communicate with it?
* And if so, does this generalize to us being able to (theoretically) perceive sound from a 4th spatial dimension?

Links and the like are also satisfactory answers, but googling didn't yield any to me.

Difficulty understanding the Man Grate Paradox,18,9,False,False,False,Physics,1513340404,True,"Hello.

As the name implies I'm having trouble with the Man Grate Paradox. The paradox comes from a scenario where some object (imagine a train) is traveling down a track at near light speed, with a hole the size of the train further alone down the track. According to relativity, the hole perceives length contraction of the train, making it smaller than the hole, so when the train reaches it it falls in. However, from the trains perspective the hole contracts, making the train considerably longer than the hole. However, because the train had fallen through the hole in one frame of reference, the train must fall through the hole in all frames.

I tried looking for solutions online, but results seem kinda sparse. Wikipedia mentions it in a section on their Ladder Paradox page, but doesn't go into too much detail.

The solution is described to be related to distorted perception of simultaneous events, where from the Hole's perspective gravity affects both sides of the pole at the same time, but the rod experiences the acceleration at different times, the acceleration causes distortion in spacetime and the train goes through.

I'm just confused on how this would look from the train's perspective. Does the hole suddenly appear wider? Does the train get sucked through the hole like a black hole?

Could anyone try making this more clear? Thanks."

So that's why I was thinking about nuclear. Surprisingly the groups I looked into don't have many grad students and don't seem as ""popular"". They have a lot of money to give out and one advisor seems to fit my personality well.

Nuclear Physics was something I never really looked into, but his specialization is heavy ion collisions and obviously that goes into astrophysics with the study of neutron stars.

Gravitational Redshift and Energy Conservation,5,4,False,False,False,Physics,1513443439,True,"It is known that photons which have escaped from a gravitational well will appear red-shifted to an observer far outside that well.  If the total number of photons involved in such an interaction remains constant, but each photon's wavelength is made longer, then the total energy in the system must have decreased.  

This has led some redditors to (hastily) conclude that the ""Total energy of the universe is decreasing"",  often adjacent to claims about the redshift seen from cosmic expansion, or what have you. 

But is this correct?   

Possibly not.  The total energy of the universe may be a constant,  while the energy in a set of photons is ""lost"" somehow through gravitational effects. But that ""lost"" energy can always be accounted for by adding back in the gravitational energy in the large astronomical bodies involved in the redshifts.  More generally, if a gravitational effect is said to violate Conservation of Energy, that violation will always and ever be exactly offset by gravitational energy.  While General Relativity allows for ""local"" violations of energy conservation, the total energy of the universe remains constant.

Should I do an undergraduate masters year? [UK - England],7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1513514711,True,"Hi, I'm on a mathematical physics 4 year course (3rd year currently), and while I had originally planned to pursue work in academia, I have realised it definitely was not the right path for me. I now find myself with the choice of whether to graduate this summer with a BSc (almost certainly a 1st with my current grades), or to take an additional year and leave with an undergraduate masters degree (MSci). I am *really* not enjoying the stress of studying so I would quite like to leave and start being paid for my work, but I don't know if I can justify doing so financially. 

Doing a 4th year would add another £9-12k onto my student debt, and delay me having any meaningful employment by a year, which seems like a pretty large opportunity cost. But from what I can dig up it at least *looks like* a masters would statistically correspond to a boost in income on the order of £10,000/year, which if true would make not staying on my course a pretty stupid decision, but I have no idea if this is an accurate premise. For physics graduates now working in some form of industry, what would you advise for someone in my position? "

what is the difference between the integral form and the base form of hydrostatic force?,1,0,False,False,False,Physics,1513515974,True,"If we have a cube subermerged 1 meter below water, and we want to figure out the hydrostatic force exerted on its top surface which is 4m2, we would use the equation F=pghA = 39240 N (g=9,81) That is the force exerted on the whole area. Now what if we did this : Integral of PghA dA where the limits of the integral are set from 0 to 4m2. Wouldnt that calculate the force on every little area element of the top surface dA and then add the forces together to get the total force on it? Im asking this question because if i use the basic form, i wont get the same force as the integral form.

Question on picking courses: Want to learn about the calculus of variations - how does this relate to 'functional analysis'?,7,0,False,False,False,Physics,1513519086,True,"**Background:**

I'm currently in the middle of my bachelors in Physics (≈ ""undergrad"" in other educational systems?). 

Last semester I had a course where I first came into contact with the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of classical mechanics. In this course we very briefly touched on the subject of the calculus of variations when deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations from Hamiltons principle by minimizing the action-functional. But we did not really justify this in 'mathematically rigorous' way (still sufficiently convincing for a physics course). Ever since then I've been intrigued by the idea of extending calculus to spaces of functions, and motivated to learn more about the calculus of variations.

Because im a fairly mathematically-inclined person, I've been mostly taking my elective courses in area's of math that seemed interesting. The list of courses I can choose from next semester includes something called ""Introduction to Functional Analysis"". If im not mistaken the calculus of variations should have something to do with functional analysis.

&amp;nbsp;

**On to my actual question:**

Could someone give me some insight to me what exactly functional analysis is? What can I expect to be covered in an introductory course and how does this relate to the calculus of variations? Also, how useful is this topic from a physics perspective?

Right now I'm inclined to register for this course. Even if it's not really what I expected, I generally enjoy learning about 'pure' maths and I've already done all the prerequisites anyway. But maybe, from a physics-perspective, there are other fields of math I might want to invest my time in first?

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:**

Interested in *the calculus of variations*. Should I take a course titled 'Introduction to Functional Analysis'?"

He's not into owning stuff for the sake of having stuff, so I want to find him something functional. He's got a stack of physics books that he never gets around to reading, so I don't want to get him more books.

But he's such a cool guy! He's so, so smart. He and his best friend swap equations for fun. He loves math and physics and magnets and astronomy and he's always just so full of wonder at the world around him. Sometimes I feel like the world just isn't challenging enough for him, his best friend just moved across the country and I worry that he feels lonely, I really want to find something to make him feel joy for a while.

A few days before this video was released, I actually came up with a model for how many batteries and how much energy the Tesla Roadster will need to go a certain distance at a certain speed.

I want to check something about my understanding of quantum, namely how to obtain the wavefunction after the measurement of an observable whose the operator has degenerate eigenvalues. 

Let's say we have consider the hamiltonian operator H, with eigenvalues E1, E2, E3, with E1 and E2 being degenerate and be [; \psi_1,  \psi_2, \psi_3 ;] the corresponding eigenstates with [; \Psi =  c_1\psi_1 + c_2\psi_2 + c_3\psi_3 ;]. If we measure the energy of the system and it turns out to be E1 = E2, is the subsequent wavefunction simply:

[; \Psi = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\psi_1 + \psi_2) ;]

as because of degeneracy there is no way to know from which state it comes from, leading to an equiprobability situation, or am I missing something?

Just a little exercise re: probing Uranus,0,0,False,False,False,Physics,1513716933,True,"I'm curious how long it would take to get a probe from Earth orbit to Uranian orbit (not a flyby) with current technologies. I figure a transfer orbit would be the easiest and most obvious approach, but even without back-of-the-envelope calculations I expect that it would take at least a decade, possibly more (based on Juno/Cassini travel times of ~6/7 years). I know that other outer-solar-system probes used ""gravity assists"" from other planets, but I don't know the physics of them so I'm not sure how to run those numbers. Is there anything else I'm missing before I try to calculate this? (Or is there a website that can just tell me and save me the trouble?)

My background is senior-level undergraduate physics with a focus in astrophysics. I'm curious about this because I'm currently working on a project relating to Uranus and Neptune, and a professor in a class last quarter ballparked that it would take 20-30 years (from inception to construction to launch to arrival) to get a probe into Uranus orbit. I was just curious how much of that was the travel time.

Medical school with a Bachelors in physics (also career paths I had in mind),4,3,False,False,False,Physics,1513717301,True,"Also posting to r/college

So I just finished my first semester of college, so far passed 3/4 finals (failed my multiple choice common core final for calc but passed the teachers final where I had to do all the questions by hand, weird). Anyways, I'm pretty happy and plan to improve more next semester. I've been thinking of a few different career options, as follows

1.) Apply to grad school for astrophysics
Space has always been a passion of mine, and astrophysics is a strong Grad program offered by my college, the only problem is the job market is rough, very rough, I'd be competing with astrophysics grads from colleges better than mine (not that my school is bad) . And that's even if I get into grad school. This was my plan since 9th grade, I read a brief history of space and time and got hooked on astrophysics and anything where I could study the universe, study stars, hunt for planets, etc. Now that I'm in college , reality is hitting me, and it's caused me to be a little depressed and rethink my major choice and life, enough so where I did extremely poorly in my intro physics course (special relativety)

2.) Apply for a dual degree program with a B.S. in physics and a Master's in Material Science and Engineering (5 years total). This option is a fall back, I guess. Idk, engineering never really appealed to me, but it is the most secure future I could think of that would still keep me in the scientific realm, plus my school has probably the best engineering program in the Northeast, which I could take advantage of

But now , to get to the title of the post

3.) Get a B.S. in physics, apply for med school?

I've recently gained an interest in med school, becoming a plastic surgeon, and orthopedic surgeon, or a neurologist. I haven't done alot of research into these fields, they just seem appealing as hell (if there's one thing I like as much as space, it's the mechanism of the human body. I've seen videos of people examining cadaver brains, and honestly if I could hold a human brain in my hand and examine it for a job, that would be awesome). This would be the most beneficial economic wise, but also probably the hardest and longest path of the 3. And it's probably the biggest stretch


So I'm going I to second semester, still early on if I wanted to completely change majors, bit I have no desire to because I just haven't put alot of thought into it.

I am curious, though, if I wanted to go to medschool, as a physics major, what would I need to do? Would I need to minor in anything (my current plan was to minor in Russian language, I've always wanted to learn the language and the culture) but would I need to minor in something like microbiology? Im taking chem instead of bio for my basic science classes, only because the last time I did bio was in 10th grade, meanwhile I did regular and AP chem I'm 11th and 12th grade, so it comes easier. I will talk to my Academic Advisor about this, but I'd like the opinions of you all. What career path would be best, or most fulfilling, and what do I need to do for each?

Thanks!"

""Over the past two decades, there has been a **transition** in the understanding of [quantum gravity] that **has not yet been fully absorbed** by scientists **outside of the field**. It used to be stated that general relativity and quantum mechanics were incompatible. There were many reasons given for this conflict, some of which **look foolish from the modern perspective**. However, a modern view is that general relativity forms a quantum effective field theory at low energies...**we now understand** that gravity and quantum mechanics can be compatible at the energies that have been experimentally probed.""

How do you calculate the probability of you teleporting to Mars?,6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1513720632,True,So I was watching a youtube video about a Japanese (quantum?)physics professor (sadly don't remember the name but sounded something like Otaku). In a part of the video he explained that in some tests he has asked students what is the propability of them suddenly teleporting to Mars. I was a little confused so I came here. How can you calculate the probability of a person suddenly teleporting to Mars for example? If I can get some explanations too it would be awesome!

It's always sounded stupid to me. ""If the ratio between the circumference and radius of a circle was 4.14 instead of 3.14, then THERE WOULD BE NO PERFECT CIRCLES :O Q.E.D. GOD MADE PI!"" That's pretty much what I get from it.

Am I missing something? I mean, how exactly have they determined that the physical constants can vary? What proof is there of any of this? Did they just try screwing around with different values for things like the coupling constant and rerun certain calculations? I really don't see how this is something that could be even theoretically postulated, let alone proven."

Mass bending light in *Newtonian* physics?,13,27,False,False,False,Physics,1513830255,True,"Most people here know that mass warps space-time (and thus the path of light). This is general relativity. But, I keep reading that gravity also bends light in **Newtonian** physics. For example, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens):

&gt;Henry Cavendish in 1784 (in an unpublished manuscript) and Johann Georg von Soldner in 1801 (published in 1804) had pointed out that Newtonian gravity predicts that starlight will bend around a massive object[8] as had already been supposed by Isaac Newton in 1704 in his famous Queries No.1 in his book Opticks.

Ok, there must be something I'm not understanding. According to Newton, all mass particles in the Universe attract each other. Unlike general relativity, there is no space-time being warped. I realize that photons have mass because they have energy (E = mc^2), but this was Einstein's insight. So, pre-Einstein, light was assumed to be massless and thus unaffected by gravity, right? If we look at Newton's universal law of gravitation, F = m1m2/r^2, the gravitational force F should go to zero if one of our two masses is light (since light is treated as massless in Newtonian physics, if my understanding is correct ...). 

Ok, I must be assuming something wrong. Could someone help me out please? Thanks!"

SPEED OF LIGHT

Light :

Electromagnetic radiation that has a wavelength in the range from about 4000 (violet) to about 7700 (red) angstroms and may be perceived by the normal unaided human eye.

According to Ole Roemer (1676) the speed of light is 227,000,000 m/s.

Hippolyte Fizeau (1849) 313,000,000 m/s.

Leon Foucault (1862) 298,000,000 m/s.

Alber A. Michelson (1926) 299,796,000 m/s.

According to the General Conference on Weights and Measures October 21,1983 the standard value for the speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s.

Now getting back to 610 AD.

In 610 AD a man claimed to have received a revelation from God.

قُلْ إِنَّمَا أَنَا بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ أَنَّمَا إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَاسْتَقِيمُوا إِلَيْهِ وَاسْتَغْفِرُوهُ ۗ وَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُشْرِكِينَ - 41:6

Say, O [Muhammad], ""I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness."" And woe to those who associate others with Allah -

This man was Muhammad (SAWW). The revelation is the Qur’an. Muslims claim that the Qur’an is predicting modern scientific discoveries. This is used by many Muslims as a major proof for the divine origin of the Qur’an.

It is claimed that the science in the Qur’an was influenced by the Greek philosophers. Therefore to test the strength of both claims lets see Surah 32 verse 5 where Allah says :

يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ - 32:5

He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count.

The equation is : Speed = Distance/Time

He arranges the matter from heaven to the earth = speed

then it will ascend to Him in a Day = time

the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count = distance

Sidereal day (with respect to stars).

Earth day :

23 H 56 min 4.0906sec = 86164.0906 sec =Time

So the equation now is Speed = Distance/86164.0906 sec

“ a thousand years of what you count”

1000 years = 12000 months

L = The route length of the moon’s trip in one month.

Distance = 12000 . L

L = v . t

v = ve . cos A

ve = 3682.07 km/hr

A = 26.92848

T = 655.71986 hrs

t = 86164.0906 sec

Now putting the figures in the equationDistance = 12000 . L

Distance = 12000 . (ve . cos A ) . T

Distance = 12000 x 3682.07 km/hr x 0.89157 x 655.71986 hr

Distance = 25831348035.086 km

So Speed = 25831348035.086 km / 86164.0906 sec

299792.49 = 25831348035.086 km / 86164.0906 sec

Calculated in the Qur’an the speed of light is 299792.49 km/sec

US national bureu of standards = 299792.4574 km/sec + 0.0011

The British national physical laboratory = 299792.4599 km/sec + 0.0008

“The angels were made out of light” Prophet Muhammad (SAWW)

وَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ سَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ فَتَعْرِفُونَهَا ۚ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ - 27:93

Ice Spikes (Bally–Dorsey model),0,2,False,False,False,Physics,1513977944,True,"According to [link](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/icespikes/icespikes.htm):
*The water first freezes on the top surface, around the edges of what will become the ice cube.  The ice slowly freezes in from the edges, until just a small hole is left unfrozen in the surface.  At the same time, while the surface is freezing, more ice starts to form around the sides of the cube.
icespikex.jpg (7709 bytes)   Since ice expands as it freezes, the ice freezing below the surface starts to push water up through the hole in the surface ice (see diagram).  If the conditions are just right, then water will be forced out of the hole in the ice and it will freeze into an ice spike*

But why doesn't the water freeze inside the tube (the spike) ?

How infinity should be impossible?,45,7,False,False,False,Physics,1513991393,True,"I was thinking about this for about half an hour.

So I thought about how some people say space is infinite (assuming they mean infinite stars etc.) but, if space was infinite wouldn’t that mean you could break conservation of mass?

Let’s assume space is finite and there are finite atoms, if you were to destroy or create an atom that would break conservation of mass because there has to be the same amount of atoms the universe started with. But, if space is infinite and there are infinite atoms, doesn’t that mean if you were to destroy/create an atom, that would not break conservation of mass since your not changing the amount of atoms in the universe because it’s infinite, you can’t take away or add to infinity because that would just make infinity.

So some things i thought of would be that he could create a area

another, more bizarre way is for him to make something akin to a super intense gravity field that goes horizontally. like a beam that forces itself through objects like wall.

Now the question i wish for a answer on is what would happen if someone where capable to do this, like would the earth's own gravity be affected somewhat or would it be of to small scale?"
I think this wikipedia page is mistaken,8,4,False,False,False,Physics,1514046745,True,"In the wiki page for the real numbers there a section on its application in physics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#In_physics


the second paragraph reads as follows:

""In some recent developments of theoretical physics stemming from the holographic principle, the Universe is seen fundamentally as an information store, essentially zeroes and ones, organized in much less geometrical fashion and manifesting itself as space-time and particle fields only on a more superficial level. This approach removes the real number system from its foundational role in physics and even prohibits the existence of infinite precision real numbers in the physical universe by considerations based on the Bekenstein bound.""

They are trying to make the point that in holographic theories binary integers would suffice. Now I am not an expert, but isnt the whole point of quantum information that qubits reside in C^2 not Z/2Z ? In this case it seems to me that not only are integers insufficient, real numbers are also insufficient as you would need complex numbers.

As I am not an expert, I dont want to go screwing with the wiki page, but if there is someone here who is an expert and could weigh in, I would appreciate that."

If a particle is measured at a particular position (e.g. shot towards a double slit somewhere on Earth) then 10 seconds later surely it has zero possibility of being found at Alpha Centauri, because it hasn’t had enough time to get there. It would have to have travelled faster than light - or perhaps tunnelled through space if that’s possible).

The uncertainty principle says that if we know a particle’s exact position, we can know nothing about it’s velocity and therefore we couldn’t predict with any certainty it’s position a certain time later. But wouldn’t the speed of light limit mean that the particle MUST be found in a given sphere of space after a certain timeframe? Or can we not measure a particle’s exact position therefore rendering the question moot?"

How to reconcile the big bang with quantum physics?,13,1,False,False,False,Physics,1514166863,True,"My knowledge of quantum physics extends solely to a couple of articles and youtube videos. As I'm learning more stuff about the quantum world, certain doubts and questions form in my head from time to time. I would appreciate it if someone more knowledgeable took the time to address my question.

I find it hard to reconcile the big bang theory with quantum physics. The big bang theory states that the entire universe had a beginning at some distant point in time. Life as we know it became a thing quite recently from a cosmological standpoint. In other words, there was no life when the universe began. One of the principles of quantum mechanics is superposition which states that the exact position of a given particle is non-existent until it is measured. Prior to the measurement we can only talk about the probability of the particle being at a certain place. I know I'm leaving most stuff out and I'm probably not using the correct lingo but bare with me.

At first glance, when you compare the two theories nothing seems to be out of place since they talk about 2 different things. When I look deeper I see 2 contrasting ideas. During the big bang, how could actual matter come into existence if there were no observers to observe it? I would agree with the notion that the probability of matter emerged during the big bang, but not matter itself since no measurement could have been made without any observers.

Again, sorry for not using the correct terms - I hope I got the general meaning across."

Does curved spacetime change also the volume and shape of the space?,15,6,False,False,False,Physics,1514213392,True,"As I read, the masses and energy curve space-time, and can lead to things like the dilation of time.

-

This curvature is usually represented in two dimensions as a plane that curves in the third dimension, but when you curve the plane, this deformation increases the area of ​​the space (the area of ​​a curved surface in the form of domes is greater than the area of ​​a flat surface), it's pure logic.

If it moves to the third dimension, the curvature would be four-dimensional (spatially speaking), and this curvature should result in a change in the size and topology of a volume in curved space, not just time dilation.

-

So this curve affects only perceived time or also to the space of space?

-

That is to say:

Can the curvature of space-time change the volume of space itself, as if it was the area of a curved surface?

Can it result in a space being greater or minor internally than that externally observed space itself?

-

And finally, as in the 2D example, the ""topology"" is changed (a curved 2D space appears in the form of a dome):
Does this happen in reality with our three-dimensional space?

Okay so, I think the idea I posit is incorrect, and here is a better explanation than any in this thread for why:

The reason the universe is said to expand is because of red shifting from distant galaxies. In fact, the further the galaxy, the greater the red shift.

In retrospect, I do not think that the idea I posited would not align to this observation very well. Also, it would not explain why there is an edge to what we can observe in the universe, which universal expansion is better at explaining.

...unless the speed of light was slowing down with the shrinkage of matter. But then that just makes things way more complicated.

Anyway, I created this account for the purpose of throwing crazy ideas out there and seeing what sticks. (And capitalizing on opportunities if possible.) The crazy idea I posit in this thread is almost certainly wrong; the fact that the provided explanations against it aren't very good explanations doesn't make this posited idea any better, and it's not a hill worth dying on.

So, I'm going to delete this thread and move on in search of better and stickier ideas.

2D Rigid Body Inelastic Collision (w/ Rotation) - What reference material exists?,4,2,False,False,False,Physics,1514302138,True,"Hello there,

I previously submitted a post in which I was attempting to determine the final velocities of a inelastic 2D collision between two rigid bodies that COULD NOT rotate. After some help and further research, I was able to find a way to do this.

However, I've now moved onto the case where I want to allow these rigid bodies to rotate.

I have modeled my rigid bodies to have inertia moments along with angular velocities at the time of collision. I also understand that I must conserve angular momentum and kinetic energy which now includes rotational kinetic energy.

However, I'm having trouble solving this. I understand at the collision point, there will be an impulse force vector along with a position vector that describes the collision points position relative to each center of mass. I will then need to break this force vector into two component vectors: one parallel and perpendicular to the position vector. This essentially breaks up the impulse force vector into two components, one inducing torque and one inducing translational movement.

I'm having a difficult time putting this altogether though.

I assume someone has worked through all of this before, does there exist a good reference?"

the ground falls up,33,0,False,False,False,Physics,1514335204,True,"I watched [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NblR01hHK6U)  video and it said ""when you fall, you are at rest and the ground accelerates up to hit you.""

And this guy means the apple doesn't move at ALL and the earth does all the moving, NOT the true statement ""the earth moves an infinetesimely small amount towards the apple and the apple moves quickly to the earth.""

This is absolutely and unarguably WRONG and RIDICULOUS. this would mean if I dropped two objects from space, each on opposite sides of the earth, the earth would have to split in half to hit them both. And common sense tells me that wouldn't happen, because things contantly fall from space. 

so, these guys in the video say ""being 'at rest' on earth and being in acceleration in space are THE SAME"".

Some basic questions about quantum physics I would love answered!,11,1,False,False,False,Physics,1514339957,True,"I watch a lot of videos on YouTube about quantum physics, the good ones with real scientists, and yet I feel many of them don’t explain the basic concepts of physics and quantum physics enough. They often jump to the more complex interesting stuff like superposition and spooky-action-at-a-distance.  

Here are some questions I’d love answered to fill the gaps. Some are very simple, some more complicated:

1. How many ‘fields’ of reality are there? I know of electro-magnetic, quantum and gravity. What are they called?

2. What kinds of primary particles/things exist in each field? (E.g the electro-magnetic field contains light, magnetism, radiation and electricity)

3. Do all particles that have mass pass through the Higgs field? And therefore do these particles all have a Higgs boson as part of their makeup? Where does this boson come from?

4. Is the Higgs field a field like the quantum field or a sub-field of quantum field?

5. Where do quanta go when then go into the ‘off’ position? I presume this hasn't been solved. 

6. Is the observer problem only happen with human consciousness? If not why? What about animals/recordings? Have Cambridge recently solved this problem or is it too early to tell?

I’ve got more but I’ll leave it there for now.

I know it is at least 14 m/s, since I have been in wind like that and not fallen over. How does my angle of leaning impact this? Leaning minimizes the surface area, right? This would make the wind pressure less, which is why I fall more easily at a certain angle. I think. I weigh 54kg, which is 533.78 N. The force of wind against my body(SA 6600cm^2) at 14m/s is way more, at 77,648,340N. I must be doing something wrong. I would be totally bowled over if that was right.

We tackled quite a bit of physics last year and this year, but I am willing to relearn all the topics we've already discussed just to be sure.

Calculate the chance of nuclear fusion in the core of the sun.,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1514475528,True,"Hi,

There is no way that nuclear fusion could happen in the core of the sun due to insufficient temperature (the core of the sun has a temperature of ~15 million Kelvin while it takes about 100 million Kelvin for nuclear fusion to happen) but we all can see that the sun still shrines. It's because Quantum Tunneling that helps Heli fuse. So my question is what is the odd of that happens in the core of the sun?

I have looked at Schrodinger equation (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/barr.html) but I can't wrap my head around the Coefficient A and how to calculate the Energy.

I want to study physics but I also want to get involved with my schools solar car team and would love to work at places like NASA, SpaceX, Tesla etc. I sort of see it like this: if I study physics I have the option to continue to pursue physics after undergraduate and also have the option to become an engineer and work for one of these companies, while if I study engineering it's harder to get into physics. My intuition is that engineering is really just applied physics, so if I go for physics I'm just getting a broader understanding of the underlying principles and so long as I supplement with learning the engineering aspects along the way, then I'm better off with physics and I can always get a masters in engineering if it's really necessary.

Gravity and energy -- What is their relationship?,3,5,False,False,False,Physics,1514539814,True,"So, I can wrap my mind around gravity.  I can visualize how mass can warp spacetime such that objects appear to *fall* together.  I get that each object is just tootling along its own path through local spacetime, and that spacetime's curvature is what account's for the apparently attractive influence between massive objects.

What I cannot wrap my head around is what happens when those objects touch.  Intuitively, it makes sense that when the objects touch, the other forces which bind their masses interact (electromagnetic, strong-weak nuclear) to generally cause the masses to retain their shapes, thus interrupting the motion towards each another caused by gravity.  But now, you are left with two objects exerting force on each other, but apparently at rest in relation to each other.  Einstein said that the force felt standing on the ground is indistinguishable from the force felt through acceleration.  In other words, it always feels like I am accelerating away from the centre of the earth at 9.8 m/s, even though my velocity does not increase.  

If the earth exerts a force on me that is indistinguishable from acceleration, and acceleration only happens when we expel energy (like when we accelerate mass away from a rocket motor), then what energy is being expended/converted/harnessed to exert the continuous sensation of acceleration I perceive when I stand on the ground?  Where does this energy come from?  I get that I am also exerting a force on the earth.  It seems like the earth is expending energy, and I am expending energy, but it's a zero sum game.  What am I missing?

At What Rate Does Wind Speed Increase When Fed Into a Funnel?,3,1,False,False,False,Physics,1514683394,True,"Thought experiment consists of an opening that starts at 10'x10' and tapers down at 30 degrees to an area of 2'x2'. It also could be tapered into a ring shape with a cone in the middle. This would allow the wind speeds to hit the turbine blades further away from the center increasing the torque. Would this be economical to maximize production on turbines without increasing the size of expensive blades (also adding weight to the system)? 

Second part of the thought experiment was to capture the excess air after doing its work on the turbine blades and trying to feed it back into the front 10'x10' opening. I understand this would create pressure problems so it wouldn't be a closed system. The area that collects the fast moving air would have a large bleed-off section to reduce unwanted pressure causing the initial 10'x10' intake to ""clog"". This devise would have 6 openings like this all around the turbine. That would insure the same effect regardless of wind direction. 

So my main question.. How much does wind increase then reduced to 20% of its initial intake size? Can you feed the extra wind speed back into a system and get greater gains? Thanks!!"

Shouldn't the bit be a unit of mass ?,6,0,False,False,False,Physics,1514686656,True,"I've just watched a PBS video about mass. It was explained as an emerging property of massless system. The explanaton was a thought experiement about a (massless) box filled with photons bouncing inside. Pushing (accelerating) the box would result in more photons colliding against the pushed side, and less photon colliding against the opposite side.  More photons (massless energy) =&gt; more perceived mass. But in some sense, a photon bouncing is merely 1 bit flip (the sign of it's movement relative to the side of the box : toward it or away from it). 

So it's as if the energy required to push an object is (linearly) related to the number of extra flipping bit in its state.

Or is the thought experiment misleading ?

"How exactly do people die from electric shock? Also, should i be dead?",30,18,False,False,False,Physics,1514718921,True,"#WHAT I DO KNOW

•I know that as little as 40 or so volts or .1 milliamp can be lethal if it comes in contact with the heart.

•I know that electrical currents kill people by potentially two methods: Burns from the heat and heart failure from the current itself. 

•I know that additionally, high levels of current can cause muscles to lock up, often causing an inability to let go of what is shocking you.

&amp;nbsp;

#WHAT I DON'T KNOW

•So far, nothing I have searched up explains the association between length of exposure and lethality, nor the association between body type/build and lethality.

•I do not understand the association between volts/amps and lethality. Sources seem to be always in conflict or simply *too* vague when it comes to what effect these things do and do not have. 

•The sources I find all point to the heart as the main cause of complications. But none address how the electrical current effects the brain. I find this odd since the brain has a lot to do with the body's electrical current. I assume the current wouldn't often make contact with the brain since it goes down to the ground directly. But if you were standing on your head or something, would that cause electrical damage to the brain?

&amp;nbsp; 

#CONTEXT

Right, so. This line of thought started because of an incident when I worked at Subway. You know those Toaster Ovens that cook your sandwiches? Well it was broken and we needed a new one. I was asked to unplug the beast, which I did manage to do; but not until after touching my finger directly on the active plug still partway in the wall, recoiling backwards, yelling a distorted ""F*CK"" in front of customers, and spending the rest of the shift on an adrenaline high. 

Upon telling my boss about it afterwards, he gave me a hilariously confused look and said I should probably be dead. But he's probably not a good source.

&amp;nbsp;

#THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS

If It helps, I looked up the details on those toaster ovens, this specific type had the following electrical stats:

Voltage: 208/240

Amps: 30

&amp;nbsp;

And thus, my specific questions are:

1. How much of an effect do volts/amps have on the lethality of electric currents?

2. How much of an effect does the duration of direct contact with an active source have on lethality?

3. Does weight or body build play any significant role in your tolerance for electric shock?

4. If the electrical currents were to somehow go through the brain, would this cause damage?

5. Given my account of my experience with being zapped, on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being Bruce Banner), how dead should I be after that?

EDIT:

6, Given that the heart is on the left side, are you more likely to die from making contact with a wire with your left hand, as there would be a higher chance of it running through your heart? Does this mean that left-handed people are more likely to die via electrocution?

•To clarify why I am asking about body type, I at one point saw a Cops episode in which a man was tased (does tasing actually use electric shock or something else btw?). The man was very overweight and the taser had an extremely minimal effect on him. The cop seemed to think it was because of his weight, as if the fat was reducing the effect of the taser."

MinutePhysics' latest Video: Claims kinetic energy conversion to radiation converts Mass to Energy,18,5,False,False,False,Physics,1514755147,True,"Here's the video in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-O-Qdh7VvQ

To me this seems... disingenuous at best and outright wrong at worst. He's comparing the rest mass conversion to energy of Fusion and Fission reactions to the chemical and thermal reactions of synthesis of water and the accretion disc of a black hole. I can make an argument for the chemical reaction being mass to energy, as the energy released is the binding energy of the electrons orbiting their atom and finding tighter bonds in a new configuration, and the binding energy of an electron contributes to the rest mass energy of an atom, just as the binding energy of protons contribute to the rest mass of Helium in the previous fusion reaction.

But he goes on to say that the kinetic energy converted to thermal radiation and radiated away decreases the mass of the object. This to me feels a lot like relativistic mass, which is just the total energy over c^(2), though he seems to imply he's talking about rest mass, as that's what's being converted in the other reactions.

Am I misinterpreting the video, or is he being vague about which mass he's talking about?"

Question about formula on phase/group velocity described on Wikipedia.,2,1,False,False,False,Physics,1514758462,True,"[Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity)

Scrolling down, the following is given:

     **""Relation to group velocity, refractive index and transmission 
     speed""**

     Since a pure sine wave cannot convey any information, some 
     change in amplitude or frequency, known as modulation, is 
     required. By combining two sines with slightly different 
     frequencies and wavelengths

    cos[(k - Δk)*x - (ω - Δω)*t] +   
    cos[(k + Δk)*x - (ω + Δω)*t] = 
    2*cos(Δk*x - Δω*t)*cos(k*x - ω*t)

     the amplitude becomes a sinusoid with phase speed Δω/Δk. It 
     is this modulation that represents the signal content. Since 
     each amplitude envelope contains a group of internal waves, 
     this speed is usually called the group velocity.


1.) I'm confused as to how a pure sine wave cannot contain any information. Through spatial and temporal measurements, both frequency and wavelength can be extracted. And from these measurements, group velocity can be extracted.

2.) Considering the RHS of the equation shown above I can then just extract the following?

     Group velocity = Δω/Δk
     Phase velocity =  ω/k

3.) I would then need a negative k to obtain a negative group velocity?

4.) how much more complicated does this become when considering more than 2 frequencies?"
