What would I get from passing FM exam other than being qualified to start out searching jobs?,7,2,False,False,False,actuary,1483239673,True,"I already passed P exam, and now I am studying FM exam on February.

Investing,25,1,False,False,False,actuary,1483240370,True,"Hello Reddit, 

I will try to keep this short. Firstly, I am sorry if this has been asked before but I am in need of some serious advice regarding investing. Before I jump into it I would like to give a short background about myself and the knowledge I have regarding investing. I am in my last year of college studying Actuarial Science and while studying for Actuarial exams (mainly FM) I have acquired more knowledge on financial mathematics and financial economics. Since I know a little bit / basics about derivatives, stocks, bonds and options I would like to get some help regarding what should I start with as I invest my money?

Personally, I have always wanted to invest in stocks but not until recently when I found out that options is not only another strategy for investing but also a quick way to make money (I could be wrong). Moreover, a friend of mine recently got into investing and they invested in stocks and mutual funds. Every time I see them they tell me how good market has been and how they made a lot of money through stocks and mutual funds. Now I am confused as to where should I begin my investment journey. After doing some research and from what I know, Options seem easy and fun to invest in, mainly because I have some knowledge on how Put and Calls and other option combinations work, but I know it is not as easy as it sounds. My second option is to invest in mutual funds but I don’t really have much knowledge about it. Third and last option would be stocks. 

Given my background as an Actuarial student and with some basic knowledge on stocks, bonds, options etc I would like to know what Reddit would recommend and if it would be better to invest in two different things rather than one, such as if I were to invest in options and mutual funds or mutual funds and stocks. I would also like to know which one of these methods (or combined) would be best in order to get more return.

Thank you very much for all the responses! "

I've started with CT1 and the material so far seems OK, the most difficult aspect seems to be the notation thus far (on Chapter 7). I was just wondering the most efficient method to go about studying for CTs? Right now my plan was:

- Use CMP and go through the material ASAP, not taking notes but just getting understanding and doing the questions as they come up
- Past papers ,Q&A bank, revision books all after this whilst referring to the notes

I noticed that the Q&A bank is right after Chapter 7, so should I be tackling this right now so save it until I've gone through all the material in CT1 for example? Realistically, I have about 4 months left until the april sitting - how many exams do you reckon I could do? I was thinking 2, but 3 might be pushing it."
"I'm interested in becoming an actuary, what should I expect, and how do I pursue this career?",6,0,False,False,False,actuary,1483399500,True,"the title basically^

Hello I am Brian, a 15 year old high school student (sophmore), who is interested in actuarial work. I am decent, if not very good at math (99th percentile on PSAT) and have taken multiple ""career path"" exams online that point to a career in actuarial science. However, I am unsure of some things in this career and wanted to ask some people with experience. 

So I've been doing some research and some main points of what I'm understanding is; 
1. You barely challenge your knowledge of math.
2. Day-to-day job can get boring. 
3. The pay is high, but very competitive.
4. It is very difficult to find an entry level job.
5. You have to basically be EXTREMELY good in statistics and mathematics in order to pursue this career.

So tldr; Are these 5 ideas correct? What will you ACTUALLY be doing in day-to-day work? and, What did you do in high school that led you to becoming an actuary? 

Thank you to everyone in advance. Your advice would mean a lot to me. <3"
Exams vs. Years of Experience statistics?,23,9,False,False,False,actuary,1483404420,True,"I assume many of us are familiar with the D.W.

Something similar to [this table](http://imgur.com/a/oSbj0), but filled with percentages of those surveyed instead of salaries.

I don't have any urgent need for the data, I'm just curious. I think it'd be very cool to map out the time difference between passing exams (though I'd assume there'd be a similar amount of fuzzing involved) and watching variability in exams passed vs. years of experience. For EL hunters, it'd be very nice to see how many exams people have in the <1 yr. column. For the more experienced, it'd be nice to see where everyone is in comparison or how many people choose to go from ASA/ACAS to FSA/FCAS over the years."

Is it okay to get ACAS by graduation?,29,0,False,False,False,actuary,1483518849,True,"I posted a similar thread on Actuarial Outpost but that was one was more addressing the issue of surviving the over-saturated entry-level market in the future.  This post is specifically about whether it's possible to ruin my chances of finding entry-level work by being overqualified.  This is in the United States, for reference.

As a freshman in college, I have P from last summer.  I've heard some controversy over passing exams too quickly.  

I personally would like to get through them as soon as possible.  I would rather have the FCAS (I'm interested in P&C) by 23, even if it means not earning FCAS-level salary for another five to ten years because in the end I will have still saved time and won't have to deal with the typical woes of having to work full time, study, and being married or in a relationship.  I've heard that there have been a few people who were able to get an FCAS at 22 or 23.  Roy Ju got his FSA at 20 which is the record for the SOA track.  Apparently he was working a part-time actuarial job with a company starting in freshman year.  I'm having a hard time believing that they never got offers because they were over-qualified.  

I'm going to definitely try to get an internship sophomore year.  My major is statistics.  I'm trying to graduate one year early since I'm fairly ahead in a lot of coursework (another controversial choice, but based on several personal factors).  I'm a part of a few clubs like orchestra, social dance, college Democrats, and being a part of the honors program.  I'll also join the professional fraternity for actuaries.  I also plan to learn all the relevant programming languages (already have some experience with Java).  So I won't be neglecting these things at all.

But I think in ideal conditions I'll be able to get an ACAS by graduation (or junior year or college if I don't graduate early).  At worst, I'll probably have 4 or 5 exams by then.  I decided to not do anything exam-related first semester, but my plan for this year is to do FM in April, MFE in July, and C in the fall.  

Part of it is just that in addition to being able to learn things quickly, taking exams (while being under-prepared) is my strength.  It's not uncommon that my homework and participation grade will be floating in the 60's or 70's due to negligence, but end up getting an A in the class after getting all A's on the exams (just happened last semester in a statistics course).  I even did it with Exam P (although I plan not to do this again for actuarial exams because I only barely passed) - only studying 75 hours not even getting through all of the material let alone doing any practice exams or additional problems besides the sets.  I figure if I actually apply myself decently, I can solidly get through many more exams.  

Is there anything wrong with doing this?  Again, I won't mind working a standard entry-level salary and even sacrificing some overall lifetime income and I definitely wouldn't expect to get paid like an ACAS having no experience.  But will companies be okay with this and still want to hire me, or will they be put off and consider it a deal-breaker altogether?  On the flip side, could this actually help me get noticed by some companies?"

For the money-hungry people in this sub only...,61,24,False,False,False,actuary,1483824316,True,"Some people come to this sub wanting to learn about actuarial compensation, and how it compares to that of other fields. That's fine by me - I don't see the pursuit of wealth as ignoble. 

With that said, I think a problem arises in that most of our contributors are either still in college, or within 2-3 years of our first actuarial job (myself included). I've seen some sweeping statements made about how the actuarial profession pays worse than other fields, typically with the evidence that ""my friends in CS out of college are making wayyy more than me"" or something of the sort. 

Sure, but careers are 30+ years long, not 5 years long. There is so much variance in each industry as to progression (programmers hit a ceiling if they don't have leadership skills) and retention (most IB analysts won't make it to MD because of long hours/connections needed to climb the ladder, most VC's don't make it to partner -  see Gus Fuldner for a relevant example) 

Anyway this post made by DW Simpson on the AO sheds some light on the long-run:

http://www.actuarialoutpost.com/actuarial_discussion_forum/showthread.php?t=117914&page=2

Question: is it possible to make high 6 figures?

Answer:

""Yes, it's possible. < 5% of them are clearing ""high 6 figures"" or 7 figures, though. 

The question that you need to ask yourself is: ""Can I be a top 5-percenter in this profession?""


And that's the key. A lot of people are asking the wrong questions and answering from the wrong perspectives. Obviously it's impossible to predict early whether you have what it takes to be a long-run ""top 5-percenter"". BUT that question should help you frame the data points you collect in evaluating whether this career is right for you better than asking about exam raise structures and average salary surveys and whether reinsurance is better than insurance.

Just a quick question about rotations programs for anyone who has experience with them. I kind of fell into an actuarial job at a health insurance company, not really what I was looking for when I graduated but got the job offer and so far enjoy the work.

My company recently started a rotations program that I could get into that would allow me to learn about more traditional actuary rolls (e.g. pricing). However, I talked to my boss about this and while they were completely supportive if I want to do it, think I would find the work boring, and the rotations are 18 to 24 months.

My question is what do you guys think about rotations and the importance of getting into the program? How hard do you think it would be to obtain career advancement opertunities without the experience in tradition actuarial rolls? Will a rotations program help my resume in the long run?

I'm still feeling like I want to become an actuary though, but I'd consider other things. There's 2 or 3 masters programs I'm consider, I would consider others.

I'm most seriously considering a masters of financial math. If I was enrolled here, I'd get another shot at all the internships that require you to be in school. I'd also be qualified for a number of other good paying jobs outside the actuarial field after I graduate. I believe this is my best option, but it's also my most expensive option.

There's also the option to get an MBA. This wouldn't be nearly as expensive as the MFM, but I don't think it would be as valuable. Even so, I think one of the biggest problems with my resume is that I don't appear very personable. This would help with that. 

Lastly, I'm considering a masters in epidemiology. I think this could make me a valuable asset to the life and health side. This is the option I'm not really considering all that seriously, but it does sound like it could be relevant and there's a fair amount of jobs that I could get outside the actuarial profession.

I'd like to hear your opinions on each of them as well as other possibilities, whether your suggestions are grad school or other things I can do.

Looking for a career change...,26,8,False,False,False,actuary,1484070884,True,"TL;DR ... want to change careers from teaching.  Is working to become an actuary worth it? 


Hey all, figured I could get some brutally honest truth from you all about something. 

I looking into options to change my career.  I'm 28 and currently working as a high school Math teacher.  I hate my job.  Not because I hate Math, but because I simply am not given the opportunity to teach it while I spend 89/90 minutes per block honing my classroom management skills. I work at a pretty rough Title 1 school in Charlotte, NC.  

I know a career change will be a few years out and will not be overnight, but I need the hope of a change being possible or I might lose my mind.  

I've recently looked into going back to school to get an MBA, but the money to do so is daunting next to my unpaid current student loans.  

I have an undergraduate dual degree in mechanical engineering and mathematics.  I have a masters in education for secondary Math as well. I have always loved Math, numbers, and puzzles and would like to be able to do what I love for once.  Is that this? 

Work experience includes a melting pot of jobs from retail to food industry to merchandising to management to education. 

From what I have researched about becoming an actuary, I know I will be spending a long ass time studying for exams that will probably break my will to live.  

What I want to know is... knowing what you all know about being an actuary, is it worth it? And more importantly, is it a possible career switch? Again, I'm expecting some brutal honesty here so don't let me down! "
Need advice about actuary....and fast!,30,0,False,False,False,actuary,1484073037,True,"So I am going to university and the plan was to do actuary. However I applied half heartedly for engineering as well at other universities. After doing extremely well in the end of high school I was placed in a difficult position as my mom said I probably should take the engineering option more seriously.

The biggest fear I am facing is if I will not be smart enough to be an actuary. My mom says if I fail then that's it. I pack my things and go home. I will be done. And knowing the past rate for being an actuary is small, I will have to prepare for failure. However I am still not sure if I want to be an actuary. I heard they retire early, which rings bells in my head. Why would anyone want to retire early? Is the job that dull and boring?

So in summary my basic questions are:

1. Is it mentally stimulating?

2. Is the job market any better than engineering? Are there jobs available and is the market saturated?

3. What else can I do with an actuarial degree? Are there other avenues?

4. If I don't pass these actuarial exams, will I be stuck as an actuarial analysts? Is there anything else I can pursue? Will it be a dead-end?"

Is the entry-level market still saturated or is it getting better?,23,1,False,False,False,actuary,1484194048,True,"For the record, I'm not some bitter guy who's applying for jobs and not succeeding, and blaming it on the market.  I'm actually just a freshman majoring in statistics with one exam passed so far (getting ready to pass more this year and hopefully get an internship next year).  I'm saying this because often when this question gets asked, the responses lead with ad-hominem attacks on the person asking the question saying that he or she is just a bad candidate.

From my understanding, it was very saturated shortly after the great recession, but it seems like that's still the case.

I hear that even out of candidates who have passed at least 3-4 exams, have done an internship (or even more), have a great GPA with some extra-curriculars, and decent interviewing skills, the majority are not getting hired.  Or maybe not the majority, but there's a decent minority of people from this subset that are not getting hired.  

Deviate even slightly from the above and you have absolutely no chance of landing a job.  It especially seems that if you don't get an internship, you basically have no chance of becoming an actuary.  This is something I've also heard - stories of people having 3-4 exams but for whatever reason they weren't able to land an internship in college (possibly even due to insurance companies not recruiting there) and they could not find any full-time work and had to forfeit their dreams and pick a different line. 

In fact, the Casualty Actuarial Society recently reported that it was estimated that 70% of aspiring actuaries will *not* be able to find an entry-level position, no matter what they do.  Sounds very depressing.

The reason I ask this is because on the flip side of this, many people seem to think or advise that anyone can go into actuarial work as long as they have a degree and are willing to pass a couple exams.  This seems bizarre when otherwise you hear people describing that the process of getting into this profession is so delicate that the slightest miss-step can force you out of this field for good. 

Which is it?  What is the state of the entry-level market right now and how is it projected to become?  Is there a difference in this regard between the CAS and SOA routes?  "

Please help me on FM practice problem!,2,0,False,False,False,actuary,1484419403,True,"At a certain rate of compound interest, $250 deposited on July 1, 2005 has to accumulate to $275 on January 1, 2006. Assuming the interest rate does not change and there are no subsequent deposits, find the account balance on January 1, 2008.

The answer is: 402.63, but I get 401.36 as an answer. I think I still have a problem with counting the actual number of days between two dates. From 07/01/05 to 01/01/06, I got 184 days.

 Since we are not counting the 07/01/05, and there are 31 days in July, it must take 30 days to 07/31/05. From 07/31/05 to 08/31/05, we have 31 days. 
Likewise, from 08/31/05 to 09/30/05: 30 days.
From 09/30/05 to 10/31/05: 31 days.
From 10/31/05 to 11/30/05: 30 days.
From 11/30/05 to 12/31/05: 31 days.

Rather, my question is how relevant in the actuarial field is it to have an undergraduate degree in Accounting along with a few summers of internships (including one with a Big 4 firm)? It seems like entry level positions are becoming more and more competitive, and I'm not sure if leveraging that previous experience is something I should focus on. At this point, I feel like anything would help.

Almost all reference sites that I have seen encourage undergraduate degrees in a variety of technical fields (math, stats, econ, etc.), but a few have also listed accounting. Even outside of the context of job hunting, is that experience ever going to be useful? I really enjoyed many of the aspects of an accounting career and it's an area I have interest in, but it just wasn't quite as technical or ""mathy"" as I had hoped, and I feel like many of my skills in that area were underutilized. On the other hand, a career as an actuary seems like it would be a perfect fit for my interests. 

Thanks in advance for your input!"

Would it be smart to go back to school for an Actuarial Science Degree?,11,3,False,False,False,actuary,1484609029,True,"I'm strongly considering pursuing a career as an actuary, and I'm looking for a bit of advice. I just graduated with a double major in physics and chemistry (with a math minor); my gpa is 3.79, and up until recently, I've been planning on going to grad school for polymer science and engineering. In fact, I just got accepted into one of the top polymer programs for next fall. However, I've come to realize that I'm simply not very good at lab work or doing any type of hands-on work, and therefore I am having serious doubts as to whether a phd or a career as a research scientist would be a wise decision.

Three years ago, I became very interested in actuarial science. I was able to talk with 6-8 actuaries at a large company, and they seemed to love their job, and I also did a fair bit of research into the field. I feel I am naturally suited towards the type of work actuaries do; I am good with deductive reasoning and analysis, and I am good at seeing trends from existing information/data. My analytical and math skills carried me through my undergrad education. I started studying a bit for the FM exam (about 30 hours total), but I quickly burned out, as the material seemed somewhat difficult, and the financial terms used were all unfamiliar. Also, I was taking a lot of courses that semester, and I wasn't fully committed to the actuary route.

I'm thinking if I go back to school for a B.A. in actuarial science, I could better learn the material for the exams (such as FM), learn more relevant information/skills, and boost my networking and internship prospects. It would take me 2-2.5 years to go back and complete the degree, and tuition would be around $13,000 per year. Would it be smart to go back to school for the degree, or just get a job with my physics degree and study for exams while I work? If I go the actuary route, I for sure plan on studying for exam P in the spring, as the material for that exam looks more accessible for someone not familiar with financial terminology. Also, am I crazy for abandoning a career as a research scientist to become an actuary? I've had an internship for 3 years at a well-known research company, and I could probably get a job there after grad school. I think science is somewhat interesting, but I more like it for the analytical thinking employed, and not as much the lab work.

- Pension regulations and litigation risks are moving companies away from creating and maintaining pension funds. Its a dying practice, hence less actuaries will be needed in these fields.


- Obamacare has reduced the need for assessing risk. This may be irrelevant following last November, but universal health care might, in some way, be securely put in place.

Friend told me its too late to consider an Actuarial career,23,2,False,False,False,actuary,1484735864,True,"So a few weeks ago I found out about actuarial work and begin looking into the work.

So I made the decision to start studying for the exam P coming up in March and start applying for internships/jobs.
This was during winter break.

Fast forward to now and I am back in school. I told my friend, who already has a full time job offer for an Actuarial position and she told me I should just look for another profession instead. She told me that to land your first entry level position you have to already have Actuarial work experience (getting an internship). And she went on to say that companies only recruit Actuarial interns IF they are Juniors. She said that Me as a Senior would not be able to land an internship thus not be able to find an entry level job. 
I just want to know if there is any truth to this and IF I should really start looking for another profession instead. This has been troubling me as I've spent my winter break studying for the exam only to be told it was too late/impossible.

From Consulting to Insurance,12,6,False,False,False,actuary,1484744519,True,"Hello fellow actuaries.  I am currently trying to change careers from consulting in a DB retirement practice to a life insurer.  I have an interview scheduled and I am seeking advice about to impress.

Some background... I went to a solid University where I studied economics, deciding to become an actuary my senior year.  I passed the first three exams very quickly and thought my personality was well suited for consulting.  Having gained 2+ years of experience in consulting, I find certain aspects of my current job unfulfilling.  I feel more like a pure consultant and less like an actuary than I thought I would.  I spend more time doing non-actuarial work than I do creating and evaluating models and making informed decisions about risk - what I thought being an actuary would entail.  That is why I have decided to pursue a job in the life insurance business.

For those currently working in the life insurance space, what are some things you would like to hear from a former retirement consulting actuary?  What would you like to hear as a reason that someone is interested in moving from consulting to insurance?  How can I blow my interviewers away?

Some things I think I will need to hurdle in an interview.  I got out of the gate quickly with the first 3 exams (6 months), passed MLC a year after MFE, and have failed C twice.  My first failing of C was non-excusable.  I had time to study but just came up short.  The second time I fell really ill (like nearly hospital) a week before my second sitting.  At any rate, I plan to be through preliminaries, have all my VEE credits, and be through my interim assessment before the end of the year.  I feel like my slowing pace of passing exams could be a knock on my resume.

Also, my college GPA was not super high.  I was a D1 athlete at a very very competitive business school which contributed to the low end GPA.  I have yet to deal with questions about my college experience, but constantly fear that they will derail me from taking on a new role.

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.

Exam C SOA #8,1,0,False,False,False,actuary,1484773194,True,"I can't seem to derive the conditional variance for this question. Maybe you all could help.

Claims are distrbutes poisson with mean M.

Claim sizes are distrubted exponential with mean 10M.

They are independent given M.

In the work below let the moments refer to the moments conditioned on M.

So, Var(NX)=E[N^(2)]E[X^(2)]-E[N]^(2)E[X]^(2)

Where E[N^(2)]=M^(2)+M, and E[X^(2)]=2*10^(2)*M^(2)

Hence, Var(S)=100M^(4)+200M^(3)

However, SOA says it should just be 200M^(3). There isn't a factor of 2 in the E[S]^(2) term so M^(4) shouldn't cancel. What am I missing?

"Risk Neutral, Risk Premium, and Arbitrage",5,3,False,False,False,actuary,1484855348,True,"Hey,

These concepts have been bugging me recently, the way I see it is this:

Premise 1: A risk neutral person is indifferent to risk, and would accept the risks on a process with positive expected value.

Premise 2: The risk premium is a margin added on top of some process to compensate for downside risk. A risk adverse person would need a risk premium on a process with positive expected value to compensate for downside risk (the risk premium would scale with the size of the risk). However, it seems like the risk-premium *over*compensates for credit-risk. Where's the risk neutral investor who is willing to accept a smaller risk premium until *all* investors are indifferent to creditworthiness

Conclusion: Risk aversion and ~~risk premium~~ risk premium profit would be ~~arbitragged away  by risk neutral entities~~ driven down by risk neutral entities and competitive market forces.

Obviously my conclusion is wrong since both concepts exist in the real-world and in academia.

Can someone help reconcile these things for me?

EDIT: 


As I think things through some more, arbitrage is not the right term I'm thinking of. The effect I'm trying to attribute to arbitrage should be attributed to competitive market forces.


I'm specifically thinking about risk neutral, risk premium, and market forces with applications to creditworthiness and interest rates."

Disadvantages of starting at a smaller company (UK - Lloyd's syndicates)?,8,2,False,False,False,actuary,1485025545,True,"Hi all,

I currently hold an offer for an immediate start at a Lloyd's of London sydnicate which has a GWP of about ~$200m. The member of the company is in fact a large us commercial insurer but they've only been competing for around 5-7 years. I have a few other interviews coming up with syndicates which are a lot more ""respected"" in the market (XL Catlin, Liberty etc.) but need to make a decision pretty soon.

Pros of joining this syndicate:

- Role is in pricing, which from my research, seems to be a lot more interesting but I guess I won't know this until I actually start

- Got on well with the head of pricing & head of actuarial during interviews

- Opportunity for a lot more responsibility as compared to other places; not sure if this is a pro per-say as this may take time away from passing actuarial exams

- Firm seems to be really decentralised and are using more than just excel/vba to price products

Cons:

My main worry is that the work I could be doing is not what ""is usually done"" throughout the industry. Meaning I could be working with limited data, and not really be able to use more advanced techniques that bigger syndicates would be using so when the time comes from switching to another job I could be at a large disadvantage. I am not too worried about the syndicate exiting the market (though they may exit some classes of business) as they seem invested in London.

I'm leading towards accepting the offer as the other roles are in reserving/capital (and I obviously have no guarantee of getting them); but I am not sure if it's a good career decision per say. If I wanted to move to a larger syndicate in 2 years or to a consultancy, how much of a problem would I have exactly?

However, I have not passed any exams yet, and I feel like this is maybe something I need to address in my cover letter. However, many websites indicate that you shouldn't focus on weaknesses, but rather on strengths. That being said, isn't this a large enough and relevant enough issue to address in the letter? And if so, what would be the best way to do so? Should I address that I am expecting to have completed P and FM by June of this year?

I'm registered for Exam P in March and have intentions of passing FM in June. Given my technical background and education, I really don't think that passing will be an issue (I'm also more than stacked with study materials atm). Although I don't have any actuarial internships, I have 3-4 internships in various accounting firms/companies, have an excellent GPA, and a very technical master's degree, so I am not a completely poor candidate.

On one hand I dont want to write more exams to achieve my ASA. But on the other they may be beneficial to my work and/or interesting as well. Not to mention possibly more exam raises depending on how employers approach it.

Two exams, Two VEEs and the modules left plus a full time job. Curious if there is anyone else here battling with the same time frame and how you've decided to approach it.

Why is there a large disparity in EL salary for Life and P&C actuaries?,5,8,False,False,False,actuary,1485834241,True,"Most of my upperclassmen have all gotten full time offers starting this summer and there seems to be a large difference between the compensation for EL P&C Actuaries who tend to start of at $60k (with 3 exams and 1 internship) and Actuaries working in Life who start of at $67k (with 3 exams and 1 internship).  These jobs are all at downtown Toronto with the major companies for both P&C and Life.

I've heard that life generally has a higher starting salary anyways but I didn't suspect that the disparity was so large.  Considering that reaching ASA is also faster than ACAS, it seems like there is a high distortion in the compensation between the two fields.  I was wondering if there was a reason that the compensation was so different - i.e. generally life companies are larger, or actuaries there have more responsibilities etc.

From internship experiences, it seems that P&C actuaries tend to have a bit more sophistication in their work than Life (but these are just internship responsibilities, I'm sure they differ from fulltime) so it is a bit surprising.

I definitely like GI and the work I've done but it's a bit discouraging when my peers who are equivalent or even a bit lesser in qualifications still have about 3-4 exam's worth of compensation above to begin with.

Also in case I came across snobby or misguided, that was not my intention.  I was just wondering if anyone could enlighten as to reasons for the disparity at EL and if there is some parity in the near future."

As for myself I'm pursuing a double major in math (not doing actuarial specialization b/c I don't want to limit myself to that) and computer science, so naturally people tell me I should be a data scientist, quant, software engineer, etc. But I still have a ton of interest in the actuarial field because I like that it is more business-y, yet technical skill is still required. If data analytics were to become more and more relevant to the job, it would draw me towards actuarial science even more.

Some atypical advice for FM,19,0,False,False,False,actuary,1486065513,True,"* Use a scientific calculator:
    I finally ordered a financial calculator two weeks prior to the exam. Greatest mistake of my life. By repeatedly plugging the equations, I not only memorized them, but I was able to recognize the mathematical patterns of the many ""different"" equations.  Once I got to the test, I stayed consistent and used the scientific calculator. I was able to finish 30 minutes early; plugging the equations didn't take that much time.

* Just study Interest Theory:
    Obviously, you should try to learn everything the SOA expects you to know. But if you're strapped for time, you should learn just what you need to pass. So based off what the [SOA has posted](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-exam-fm-detail.aspx), you only need to know/master Interest Theory, which comprises 65-80% of the exam. If the test is 65% Interest Theory, then you can expect a score of 72% (getting 20% of the remaining questions right). Pass. If the test is more, then you pass regardless of chance. This will probably change come July though.

Edit: Obviously this is not ideal. I used these strategies to pass with one month to study and with little prior exposure to the material. "

Ugh... derivatives,11,7,False,False,False,actuary,1486069025,True,"21 days to exam FM. Soon, I know. I'm solid on the interest theory stuff, but derivatives (which I understand to be about 1/3 of the exam) are still escaping me somewhat. I'm trying to truck through the final chapters of an old Actex manual but the chapters are SO LONG and SO BORING I don't feel that I'm truly absorbing the material or utilizing my time most efficiently. 

I also have an Adapt subscription and I feel as though I'm learning more by doing the low-level derivative questions, getting them wrong (of course) and then making flash cards from the concepts. I've also been watching some Youtube vids to supplement this.

So my question is this: Has anyone else learned derivatives this way? Or have any recommendations for alternate study materials? I'm terrified that I'm not going to fully cover the material if I give up on the manual, but I'm really just not connecting with it right now.  

Edit: Thanks everyone for the unanimous and awesome advice! I'm looking forward to my weekend of payoff graph memorization :) 

Edit edit: Just passed and everyone's advice was spot on. The derivatives material was minimal and most questions simply asked for the correct graph. Only one question on the put-call parity. Probably a level 5 on Adapt. Thanks again!!!"

"Is getting a new job the easiest way to increase salary after getting credentialed? I need help navigating rotation programs, bonuses, and salary increases. (Huge wall of text warning!)",13,8,False,False,False,actuary,1486272890,True,"Northeastern US, go to ""**So here's the problem**"" to skip the backstory, salary at the very bottom.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
I'm going to get my ASA in about five months, which will be right after department rotations. Rotation is different for me, since I'm actually one of a few actuaries in a subsidiary company that does ancillary benefits compared to Retirement. So ""rotating departments"" will basically be moving to a new company, as I've never done that exact work before and there's nobody in the parent company that I know personally.

I get an $8000 ASA designation bonus (from parent company), but no subsequent increase in salary. I know that I can definitely make more than I'm making right now, which will only increase with the ASA designation. Probably an unpopular opinion, but I'll never feel loyalty to any company so long that I'm not in senior management, so I have no reservations of leaving my current company promptly after getting my $8k bonus. 

**So here's the problem**, I want the $8k bonus that I deserve upon getting credentialed and I also want a salary increase. This would be easily attained by switching jobs after getting credentialed. I feel like I'm a very good candidate for new jobs since I'll be credentialed right after turning 24, I have experience with a bunch of different LOBs and programming, and frankly I don't look or have the personality of how actuaries are typically perceived (Not tryna go all /u/CoffeeAddiction, but it does make some difference). This all gets muddied-up since rotations occur right before I'll get credentialed.

Possible options/repercussions:

1) I get my current company to withhold rotation, and then leave shortly after getting my bonus (probably won't work because rotation is technically mandatory). The repercussion being that I'll leave them out to dry since nobody would come in from the parent company. Also, I have a lot of respect for my boss and would feel uncomfortable lying to him with ""I'd prefer not to get rotated because I want to work here so badly...""

2) I get my bonus, rotate, and then leave the new company about a month after joining. I feel like this would not go over well and be considered a slap in the face, but maybe I'm over thinking it? Leaving my current company after getting my bonus probably wouldn't make them happy, but doing this feels like it would burn bridges. 

3) Ask for a raise in between rotations. Not really any repercussions, but very slim chance of it happening. I don't know how it would come across to my new company or how I would even bring it up - I wouldn't ask my current boss since he has no say in the matter, and I don't know anyone at the new company. Also, wouldn't I need an offer in hand anyways? Like if I *do* get an additional raise but it's way short of what I want, then I'll end up leaving them anyways and probably burn a bigger bridge.

4) Stick with the new company and accept my lower salary because I'm softer than butter.

Has anyone been in this situation before that can offer advice? I'm sorry for word vomiting, but this will be the first time switching jobs and I really don't know what to do. 

For reference, my salary right now is $66k and $72k on my W2 after all company/exam bonuses (1.75 years experience). People recently got hired with 3&4 exams and ~a year experience that make more than I do, and are honestly just not great workers. I think I could easily get $85k+ after ASA by switching jobs."

I had always been very interested in becoming a quant, but I discovered the actuarial profession and thought it could scratch the itch for financial math or computational finance. I don't have a passion for traditional insurance, but the 40 hour a week and low stress job appealed to me.

I'm sitting for Exam MFE in 5 weeks and 
after passing FM and P, I realized that I really love financial math. MFE is by far the most interesting/stimulating material of what I've seem of the prelims.

I know there is the QFI track which I fully intend to go down. But would I be doing myself a disservice if getting a masters in quant. finance would be a better fit?

Pros of QFI:
-Never have to go back to school, but especially incur debt from a 50,000-100,000 masters program

-I get to be paid to learn curriculum that has a lot of overlap with what's taught in a Masters of financial maths

-Would likely still have the perks of being an actuary (low stress and hours compared to banking, probably a better work life balance)

Cons of QFI:
-Getting to the QFI exam material means sitting through uninteresting prelims geared towards insurance, especially since I won't be an ASA by June 2018. Not the biggest deal I suppose, but will take another 1-2 years.

-Likely won't be programming in C++ as part of my job, or programming in any real sense at all (something I enjoy)

Pros of a masters in mathematical finance:
-Would be studying exactly what I'm interested in with the bloat of insurance concepts

Cons of a masters in mathematical finance:
-Debt + 1-2 years of lost earnings

-Extremely competitive field where you're competing against the brightest PhD students in maths and physics for jobs

-Long hours, stress, low job security

-I am definitely well above average at math, great even, BUT not elite. I have always gotten by hard work and dedication. I may not have the raw aptitude though for literally cuttinf edge PhD level maths

In the field of Actuarial Sci/Math, I see there are various jobs one can pursue. I do occasionally see posts that contain the words ""billable hours"". I was wondering what types of actuarial jobs implement the concept of billable hours. 

Is it just with consulting jobs that use billable hours? 
Or are all actuaries required to bill their hours? 

This question came up because I honestly don't know how or what actuaries do. Studying for exams is one thing, but I have no idea on specific jobs actuaries do. Thanks in advance!

Let's talk about the SOA,8,0,False,False,False,actuary,1486412987,True,"Starting next year, Exam FM, MFE, MLC and C will be undergoing drastic syllabus changes.

FM will no longer have derivative markets.
MFE will no longer have stochastic models.
C and MLC will be getting neutered.

In the end, all 4 exams will be significantly easier content-wise.
I'd like to know why the SOA is hell-bent on watering down the exams. Is it to reach diversity numbers? Is it because insurance companies bribed you to make the exams easier to pump out more candidates?"
Worth it to try to get ASA before changes?,12,6,False,False,False,actuary,1486417778,True,"Hey everyone, I'm in a weird position with the upcoming SOA changes and am looking for some advice. I still have MLC, C, and both modules to pass before the changes take effect in July 2018, so I am right on the edge of being able to make it in time. I am a senior set to graduate in May, and part of my dilemma comes from wanting to enjoy my last semester of college with my good friends before graduation vs spending the last two months locked in my room to study for MLC. I already have a job for after college, is it worth it to work my ass off for the next year and get the ASA before the changes? Can I take MLC in the fall and still have time to get everything else before July 2018? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

To anyone who has used The Infinite Actuary,8,1,False,False,False,actuary,1486429967,True,"I started studying with the infinite actuary back in October for my FM exam and I loved it. Naturally when I started studying for exam P I decided to use it again. Well I don't know if I just don't have as much background with statistics as I do with financial math, but I don't understand it at all. When I was studying for FM, I felt like James was really explaining everything in a lot of detail....maybe even too much detail at times, but I liked it that way because I knew every step he was taking and why. I find the P seminar to be much different. I feel like he starts skipping steps because he assumes the audience knows what they are doing and doesn't go into as much detail as to why we are doing what we are doing.

I guess my question is, did anyone else have this problem? If so, did you pass the actual exam? Did you have to use other resources? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."

How long did it take you guys to hear back from job/internship interviews?,7,2,False,False,False,actuary,1486516094,True,The reason I ask is because I recently had an internship interview at Willis Towers Watson that I thought went great.

Just got entry-level job offer - need advice ASAP,32,1,False,False,False,actuary,1486532448,True,"After several months of focus and un(der)employment, I've managed to get a few entry-level actuarial job offers at the same time. For the past few days, I've narrowed my decision to my historical top choice (it took months to receive an offer) and a wildcard firm. 

The top choice has many things going for it: salary, bonuses, profit sharing, location, location, location. 

The wildcard has other advantages: negligibly lower salary, more exciting work,  a probably more interesting field, more programming and working with data (a plus for me). In fact, I nearly opted for the wildcard, except for one tiny detail: the position starts as hourly, not salaried. Of course, I would likely become salaried at some point ""based on my performance,"" but the top-choice offer starts me on a salary. 

My question is, does this matter? Am I right to reject an offer because it is hourly when I might accept it otherwise? 

Please don't hesitate to share your thoughts and experience. Thanks!"

I have M Finan's study manual and a coaching actuaries two week subscription. I also can study 3 hours Monday thru Friday (12 days) and all day on the 4 weekend days I have until the test.
How do you recommend I prepare to give myself the best chance come test time? Any suggestions on what to focus on? I know I can pass with this amount of time, but my chances would be much better with some advice from someone who has taken it.

I know that I can't get away with doing this for future exams, so you don't have to comment: ""Good Luck trying this in the future"". Working overtime + studying has been hard.

A few mod notes,33,23,False,False,False,actuary,1486691426,True,"Hello all.  I wanted to mention a couple things as moderator, just as an FYI on the subreddit.  Of course, suggestions are always welcome.

**Spam**

Spam has increased dramatically over the past few weeks.  The major source has been a reddit-wide problem with sex ads.  Please keep reporting those threads and I'll send them away as soon as I can get to them.  These ads aren't just on /r/actuary, but can be found all over the site, especially on smaller subs.  

We also had an issue recently with a user posting her ebook and YouTube channel as her first post.  While I appreciate the reports and don't feel any remorse for the comments pointing out the shortcomings of her offering, I have a problem with the subsequent mock-posts that appeared.  The user is currently under a temporary ban and appears to have good, although misplaced, intents, so please let her have a chance to respond once the ban expires and she starts posting again.  Of course, if she starts spamming, it is your duty to report and downvote to oblivion.

**Trolls**

We've also had an increase in trolling in the past few weeks.  Some of them are just off-the-cuff remarks, but there have also been some more persistent trolls that are coming back under multiple accounts.  Please continue reporting these folks, and I will continue to swing the ban hammer as necessary.   I'd like to remind anyone reading that it is a violation of reddit's [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy#section_prohibited_behavior) to make new accounts to circumvent a ban.

**Automoderator**

I would like to implement automoderator on the subreddit in order to help deal with several of the above issues.  As I implement and fine-tune the program, some legitimate threads or comments may be removed.  If so, please message the mods and we'll look into it.  I'd also like to start up a couple of recurring threads to help guide activity.  Stay tuned.

Edit: OK, I've taken my first swing at AutoModerator.  Hopefully it doesn't eat too many innocent posts!

**Newbies**

As always, please be patient with newbies.

Just a reminder that we have flair on this subreddit.  I grant them all individually.  Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/p0xp9/hello_there_ractuary/) for the choices and message the mods if you'd like one.  "

Is it worthwhile to study programming?,4,2,False,False,False,actuary,1486700564,True,"Hi everyone - this is my first Reddit post

I live in Australia and most universities here offer double degrees (quite different to the US). I'm currently enrolled in a double degree of Software Engineering and Actuarial Science which is 5 years, but if I'll end up finishing it it'll probably take me 6years since I'd underload to make things easier.
My intention is to work as an Actuary, so my question is whether it's worthwhile to finish the Software Engineering degree and how valuable it'll be in the workforce. I've finished a whole year of uni, and completed a mix of Actuarial science and engineering, so I could still finish the Actuarial degree in a total of 3 years.
I'd appreciate your opinion whether it's worthwhile to continue or not and if the programming skills will really be able to get me a higher paying job in the long term after finishing being a fully accredited actuary.

Questions from an aspiring actuary,26,3,False,False,False,actuary,1486790060,True,"Hi, I'm currently a senior in high school who really wants to become an actuary. I have a few questions

1. I keep getting mixed input regarding how much people enjoy a career in actuarial science. Lots of people have said that everyone they know who is an actuary hates their job, while other places I see it as one of the most enjoyable. Anyone have any insight into this? 

2. Regarding time commitment.. I am really excited for the college experience, and would like to participate in things such as student organizations, going out a decent amount, having a life, etc... Is this possible while getting an actuary degree and taking exams? Obviously studying for exams is very time consuming, and with my program I am planned to complete 3-5 exams before I graduate, all while taking difficult courses. Here is a sample of what my curriculum will be - https://math.osu.edu/sites/math.osu.edu/files/undergrad_current-majors_requirements_actuarial.pdf - I will be also completing all the VEE's and getting a minor in statistics (only a few classes added). What does the time commitment for this look like? Will I be able to have a social life? 

3. I know the organizations such as CAS/ SOA are very popular, but I have no clue how popular the ASPPA is. Is this organization known amongst actuaries? Long story short, I have really good connections with the president, and I'm just curious as to how big of a deal that is (if I have connections with the president of one of the biggest organizations known amongst actuaries, or just a smaller organization that isn't very popular). 

4. Any comments on the curriculum of the program I will be doing? (see link above) Any important classes actuaries should take that aren't required there? Again, not listed there are the VEE's classes I will be taking (Investments, Intermediate Data Analysis 2, Time Series Analysis)

But the more ""career exploration"" I do, the more I find myself coming back to actuarial science, and the more I desire to concentrate my efforts in subject areas related to it. For now, I feel like I am at least focusing on subjects that could be useful to someone in actuarial science (machine learning, algorithms, general comp sci subjects) but I'm not necessarily focused on studying for exams, for example. 

I already passed Exam P and have an actuarial internship this summer that will hopefully tell me more about if I like the career path. With all this in mind, I guess my questions are:

1. Do you for sure need 3 exams passed to get an entry level job at this point?
2. Would it hurt me if I were to do an actuarial internship this summer, but then do a job in something else (like software engineering) for the summer after my junior year?
3. How likely am I to get an entry level job if I do decide to pass 3+ exams and have a GPA of 3.8+ with one internship? It seems like this should make it easy (granted I put in a lot of hard work to try to accomplish these things), but I don't have a sense of exactly how hard the job market is.

Advice for EL candidates with Low GPA,12,32,False,False,False,actuary,1487258898,True,"**My background:**  Just accepted first permanent actuarial position and had a 2.38 GPA in college.  I've never been in a position that hires so take my advice for what it's worth.  HM's can explain better than I what they're looking for, but I just want to share my experience from a job seeker's perspective.

**Advice:**  
First evaluate why you want to be an actuary.  You need accept the fact that it's going to take some work and some time to land that first EL position with a low GPA.  

**Find any positives possible in your GPA:**
Being entry level, your only full body of work that HM's can evaluate is your school work, i.e. your GPA.  If you're still in school, turn it around for whatever amount of time you have left.  This way after you provide an explanation (not an excuse) for your previous GPA, you can point to the success you've had since and have evidence.  If you have a strong math GPA be sure to highlight that.

**Get some transferable work experience**
If you've recently graduated, I would plan on getting a related non actuarial position.  Work a year or two in a position while building strong references that will speak to your work ethic and ability.  Underwriting positions provide a nice way to network and learn the insurance business better.  Data analytic contract positions through tech recruiters are pretty easy to find if you are fresh out of school and have strong tech skills (which you will likely need to get an actuary position anyway) like Excel/VBA/SQL.  Think of work experience and references as a way to replace your most recent body of work (school/GPA).  Some places will still focus on the low GPA, but many others will be more interested in hearing about your work experience and how it will transfer over to the position in question.

**Speaking of tech skills...**
Compensate for your poor GPA and learn some strong tech skills however you learn best.  The ones I've seen the most in job postings are Excel, Access, VBA, SQL/R, and sometimes an OOP language like C++/Java.  For me learning tech skills is just about being creative with things I enjoyed.  I end up following tutorials like a robot, instruction by instruction, so these typically are not very helpful for me.  For instance, instead of doing an excel/vba tutorial, I found some fantasy football stats, cleaned it up with VBA code, then played around with some excel lookup functions and a pivot table to create a rankings.  If possible use these skills in your work experience so you can reference examples you've worked on in interviews.  

**Exams**
Keep studying and passing exams, especially while working.  To many, passing an exam while working full time with no study hours is far more difficult than passing exams while in school.  I would shoot for at least 3, but 2 may be enough to get you to a phone interview.  Exams are another way you'll need to compensate for a poor GPA.

**When applying for actuarial jobs**
Apply for as much as possible.  Don't stop no matter how many interviews you have until you have an offer.  Network as much as possible.  It can't be said enough that networking is the best way to find a job.  If possible expand your geographic preferences as wide as possible.  I left my GPA off my resume and job applications hoping this would reduce the chances my application/resume would be filtered out or never looked at.  I've heard plenty of conflicting opinions on this though.  Highlight strong exam progress, strong work experience, and strong tech skills on your resume.  In my experience these 3 things were enough to get me plenty of hr screenings/HM phone interviews.

**During Interviews**
Sell your communication skills!  It is important to do as many practice interviews as possible to strengthen this for interviews.  The employers I spoke with want to see how you can explain technical processes to non technical audience.  Describing technical projects you have worked on is a great opportunity to show your work experience, tech skills, and communication skills all in one response.  If your GPA comes up show how it was a learning experience and then point to the successes you've had since.

Moral of the story is that all is not lost if you have a low GPA.  There will be some companies that won't even consider candidates with a low GPA, but there are still plenty that will.  It's a hurdle that can be overcome through compensating with above average work experience, communication, tech skills, and exam progress.  Hope this helps someone!"
Exam Pay Increase Process,6,2,False,False,False,actuary,1487273929,True,"I'm curious as to how other people's companies go about instituting pay raises.

A weird situation that's left me confused,16,5,False,False,False,actuary,1487284661,True,"About two weeks ago, the professor at my college that does the recruiting for the actuarial and mathematical degree tracts informed me that a very prominent insurance company was looking for interns and potentially full-time employees and all I had to do with email my resume to someone. What made this situation even better was that I had met this someone several times at career fairs and had talked to her for a few hours about the company, her position, the job, and all that jazz. I wasn't too surprised when I got an email back that I'd be getting a preliminary phone interview in a day or so, though I was surprised since I'm what I would consider to be the most average actuarial student.

I schedule this phone thing, get the call that's supposed to be just a half-an-hour, but end up laughing, joking, and shooting the shit with the guy for over an hour. The guy hangs up after telling me that even though he has no control over in-person interviews, he's going to really recommend that I get to come in and meet with everyone. If I said that I was ecstatic, it'd be an understatement.

So, I get an email the next day, asking me for my availability over the course of the next week. I tell them that I absolutely cannot make it one of the 10 business days because I'm sitting for FM (2nd try) and after another day goes by, I'm emailed directions to one of the main offices, a collection of names of everyone I'll be meeting with and when, a list of several nearby hotels and motels to crash at if I don't feel like making a 3 hour drive home after the day is done, and everything seems peachy. An hour later, though, I get an email back that tells me that the interview will unfortunately have to be rescheduled, but no explanation or reasoning for it, even when I responded asking what had went wrong.

It's been 3 days, and neither the HR lady, my contact that I know, or phone interview guy have responded to any emails. A classmate of mine, whose name I recognized on the initial email about phone interview times, got the same treatment. We're both pretty much confused as to what has happened and why we suddenly got the silent treatment when we both were on our way to get an in-person interview.

Should I be worried? Is this typical and just occasionally happens?"

In a few weeks I'll be debating the points for working in pensions as opposed to life insurance.

I've done a fair amount of research online but there's only so far you can get with figures and general ideas without having worked in either industry.

So, if any pensions/life actuaries could share their views, or anything at all, about their actuarial sector, that would be a huge help!

Cheers

MLC Video Lessons from Coachingactuaries,3,2,False,False,False,actuary,1487497649,True,"Anyone passed MLC with the aid of video lessons from coachingactuaries? The official website states and claims that ""Learn everything you need to know to pass with our in-depth Video Lessons"" and I really doubt that. The video lessons are just simply slides with some simple explanation, some colorful highlights and show some substitution. I have played a few video lessons and I noticed that there are very limited animations and time diagrams. Isn't it easier to explain some topics like introduction to insurance, benefit reserve with time diagrams? I personally think that terms like insurance, initial benefit reserve, terminal reserve, net cash loss and calculation of reserve would be best explained with time diagrams. (Just draw a time diagram and labelled the premiums, benefit and what you are going to find, either prospectively or retrospectively would be helpful.)   
However, I could hardly find any time diagrams in the video lessons. Besides that, I think I could not understand many of the lessons if I was not taking a similar course in the university.
Nevertheless, I had a really great experience with exam P and FM from Coaching Actuaries. The video lessons and ADAPT were impressive and helpful and the explanation is crystal clear but I really disappointed with their MLC video lessons. "

Quick FM question.,6,1,False,False,False,actuary,1487566143,True,"I'm using TIA to study for the FM exam in April..kinda blazing through it but I'm confused about how this question was solved.

Solution:
100 + 200v(4 periods, 0.03 interest) + X(10 periods, 0.03 interest) = 500v(6 periods, 0.03 interest.

Choosing a college major,11,8,False,False,False,actuary,1487720378,True,"Hi, I'm a senior in high school (US) and I've been accepted into a school which provides an actuarial science degree. Financially, they've given me a full ride and emotionally I have an SO of 2 years who already goes to that college and a few friends who are going into act sci. I really enjoy my AP Econ classes and I'm pretty good at stats, I love cal, and physics isn't too bad. I was considering going into Industrial Engineering, but that market seems a bit saturated and the pay is lower. From what I've read on here, going into act sci ""pigeonholes"" you into one career. So my questions for the act scis: 
In your experience, did you feel that you would have an enjoyable and secure job coming out of college?
Is there any advice you wish you were given before going into act sci?
Do you think an act sci degree is more valuable than an engineering degree when it comes to life after college?

Will a ~3.2 overall GPA hold me back from getting an internship?,7,0,False,False,False,actuary,1487767450,True,"It looks like that's around the overall GPA I will be at after completing my freshman year.  I'll be looking for internships in the fall.  

First of all, I'm not an Actuarial Science major, but a Statistics one.  The reason it's on the lower side is first semester I had trouble adjusting and fell into depression and then overall I've been having to take a lot of classes in my weakest areas.  I've also been getting sick a lot which got me behind in classes a lot as well so I've often been stuck playing catch-up.  I expect to graduate with a higher GPA in the end, but at the end of this year it won't be quite that high.

I passed Exam P in July 2016, sitting for FM in April, and if I pass that, I'm planning on sitting for MFE in July and C in October.

I'll also be taking the TIA technical skills course over the summer so I have the necessary computer skills.

At the moment, although I'm a freshman, my expected graduation date is May 2019, although if I fail to get an internship in summer of 2018, I'll stay another semester to have an additional summer to get one (in summer of 2019).  I know I want to go CAS-side and once I'm done with preliminary exams, I plan to start taking the CAS ones - MAS-I, 5, and 6.

Asking for advice for studying to pass FM,16,2,False,False,False,actuary,1487887836,True,"Hello,
I've been studying FM for about a month and half . I am scheduled to take my exam tomorrow, but I don't believe I will pass it based on my knowledge.
I am hoping to get some feedback on how I can go about studying from this point on, to pass the April exam.
Part of the struggle in the past was studying regularly, because my current work is very demanding (Sometimes I work until midnight and weekends). I've been trying my best not to work after 6pm since last month, so I was able to put an hour or two per day, but now I realize that it was just not enough time for me to study FM since I have never studied finance or financial mathematics ever before and my math was rustier than I thought.
Anyhow, I'm trying to make sure I have a great plan for next exam, since I really want to pass the FM before the syllabus change. Granted that I'll put in 1-1.5 hour per day, how can I strategize studying for the next 55 days or so?

Should I try to go back to learning contents and solving problems? Should I do that for all sections or start with mastering high yield sections, and do whatever I can for the remainder of the time?

I am not sure if I should prioritize sections, and how I should go about studying them. Should I do section quizzes and then go back to the materials for where I don't know? At what point should I start taking exams? and how many mock exams do people usually take?

I've never had any difficulty passing exams in the past. I got perfect score for GRE and SAT math and almost perfect in Verbal. I know this is only the prelim for actuaries, but it's really no joke! I think its the hardest exam I've ever taken... or maybe its because I'm trying to study while having a really demanding full time job. How do other career changers think of FM and P? Studying for this exam made me believe that all actuaries must be really smart and hardworking...

Are my plans for my next steps worth it?,16,2,False,False,False,actuary,1487968495,True,"This may be long-winded, apologies ahead of time.

I have a BS in Mathematics and will be finding out if I obtain my MSc in Actuarial Science in March. Before you criticize my decision to get a Masters, please note a few things. In March, I will also get my results for Exam 1/P, Exam 2/FM and VEE Finance exemptions. My Masters was in London, UK and I had the time of my life. So it was my decision and it's done. Right now I'm working towards credit for VEE Applied Stats (should be done in about a month) and I already have credit for VEE Economics in my undergraduate courses. I plan to take Exam MFE in July and Exam C in October.

I've been applying to entry-level positions for a few months and have not had any luck. I live in an area with no actuarial positions and limited analyst positions (think south, small town). I am about to go back to a part-time retail position for money so I can save to move.

Is it worth it for me to continue living here for a few months to take Exams MFE and C? I'm fine moving pretty much anywhere and have applied pretty much everywhere with very little response (never asking for relocation fees in applications). To be fair, I'm really just at a loss for what I should do next and exams are the only sound thing in my head.

Would a Masters degree with exam credits really make me more hire-able when I don't live in the area? I have no preference to SOA or CAS track and have been mainly focusing on things that are transferable.

Area's (small scale / non corporate) that you think can benefit from implementing the concept of capital ?,3,2,False,False,False,actuary,1488124524,True,"I worded this question pretty bad, but I'll give an example to show what I mean:

bob own's 10 houses that he rents - as revenue property, he has a fund (reserve) to cover maintenance and repairs, the odd month that rent isn't paid or the place is empty.
if recession occurs maybe 3/10 houses are empty, and bob still needs to pay the mortgages, the fund is nearly depleted so has to sell one of his houses at a huge discount since there is not enough liquidity in the market for him to get a loan... if bob knew about the concept of capital / planning for unexpected events, he could have had enough liquidity to either ride out the recession or last long enough and give him more opportunity to plan and find sources of liquidity. 

This is pretty basic, but I'm curious if there are areas of society that are missing this concept and could benefit from some actuarial type help.

Oversea internships—how to reach out and land a job,10,2,False,False,False,actuary,1488271893,True,"So I've been lurking here for a bit and figured that I wouldn't bother to ask questions relating to exams and which one to do first...

I've done about 3 semesters of research, only one of which is in statistics. I know R, SPSS, all Microsoft suite, and Spanish to boot. On top of that, I lead 3 organizations on campus.

As it stands, I'm making over $41,000/year (I became homeless so I qualify for tons of money, plus I work as hard as I can) in scholarships and I am happily applying for unpaid internships, but I just don't know the exact medium to reach out to people.

Debating on actuarial vs computer science careers.,9,19,False,False,False,actuary,1488365318,True,"Up until now, I've been vastly committed to becoming an actuary.  However, computer science has lately been looking like a great option as well.  I really love problem-solving, the application of math in this respect, and logically rigorous tasks in general, and figuring out solutions to very difficult tasks in this respect, which is why so far I've been having a great time with the actuarial exams (I enjoy studying for them and I've been doing pretty well).  

However, I hear that the actuarial field in terms of job responsibilities isn't actually that technical and that the upper-level exams become mostly qualitative in nature, so I'm not sure if it's something I really enjoy in the long-run after I'm done with preliminary exams.

It seems in that respect, computer science may appear to better cater towards my strengths and likes in the long-run.  Again, I am really liking the preliminary exams and the skill-set they require to do well on them, but I'm not sure if this is how it's going to continue to be like.

"First time with a multi-interview process on Friday, any tips?",11,4,False,False,False,actuary,1488822450,True,"TL:DR- Any tips for multiple interviews on-site for entry level actuarial work?

In my current position, I was hired as an intern and was hired after only 1 or 2 phone interviews. From there I stayed onboard after the internship and I'm still here nearly 2 years later. It's a startup company.

I've landed an interview with an established company for this Friday, going to be spending a few hours with them in-person interviewing with about a half dozen people, varying from directors to VPs.

While in school I worked as a waiter so my people skills are quite good, provided I'm prepared enough and don't get thrown too many curveballs, but I can handle a few because I know I won't be able to foresee every question of theirs.

Does anyone here have any tips for interviews like this? I'm not sure what they could want to discuss with several higher-ups. I already know what I like about the company and how they appeal to me, as well as everything I've written on my resume. So that should answer a decent number of questions.

Alternative professions for a wanna-be actuary?,3,0,False,False,False,actuary,1488839337,True,"Not sure if this is the right sub but I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions on other professions an actuary can get in to?

However, so far I haven't heard anything back and I've run out of places to apply. I don't really want to move, so I don't know what to do now. 

Does anyone have suggestions on alternative career paths that I will learn skills that can later be transferable to being an actuary? I've passed 2 exams so far so I don't really want to give up on that dream.

Also, could the lack of opportunities be due to the season? Do you think more job openings will open up late spring when people are graduating?"

Psychology Honours into Actuarial Sciences?,5,1,False,False,False,actuary,1488867047,True,"I am a 3rd year honours student currently studying psychology with a minor in statistics at a large research university in Canada. I am beginning my thesis within the field of consumer behaviour under the supervision of a professor of marketing and expect to graduate next year. While I had originally planned to pursue graduate studies in marketing, I had managed to land an job as an financial analyst for my provincial government where I still currently work part time. This experience, however, seemed to have directed my interests away from the study of behaviour and towards actuarial sciences (my research regards mostly regional differences in costs of living derived from a large range of indicators and forecasting). As a result of this, I have decided to pursue a side-project under the supervision of an actuarial sciences professor who admittedly was quite fond of the idea that I and honours psychology students have the requirement to write a thesis. In fact, he said that this would likely make me a good candidate towards an actuarial sciences program given that the Master's program at my school requires a thesis.

Is this true? 

I see that most applicants are maths majors, and while I have taken calculus, micro/macroeconomics and basically all statistics courses offered by the departments of statistics and psychology, would I still be looked down upon? My current GPA is 4.45/4.5 and I am not too worried about the GMAT."

Attempt exam twice in same sitting.,6,0,False,False,False,actuary,1488907249,True,"Is it possible to take an actuary exam, fail, and schedule another sitting during the same testing period?

I'm pretty confident about my MFE.  I have a 6.5 earned level in ADAPT and don't really feel like studying more for the exam so I would reschedule my exam for this week, make an attempt and then if I were to fail just take it the next week after if possible without having to wait a long time to take the test again."
Is this still worth pursuing this as a new career? Outside the East Coast? After 30?,22,0,False,False,False,actuary,1488907994,True,"My boyfriend in college had a father who was an actuary. He extolled the wonders of the field, that it was a rewarding job that allowed his family to live well despite his parents' lower-middle-class upbringing. He himself declined pursuing that career because he wanted to move to Florida, and said that outside the Northeast Corridor (especially Hartford and NYC), and possibly LA, there are few opportunities for actuaries.

I myself didn't fare well in college math courses the first time around. Neither did I have any internships, so I didn't entertain the idea to break into an actuarial job straight out of college. My life has changed since then; I've moved around the country and back, then went back to school, where I've done well in my calculus coursework. My immediate goal is to complete an MS in statistics because of the versatility of such a degree; one such path I may follow would be becoming an actuary, but it seems that it is more difficult than my college boyfriend led me to believe.

My current SO has a mathematics PhD from a Big 10 university. His current job is teaching in a visiting professor capacity, at least until this semester ends. He's still in the Midwest and is trying to break into the actuarial field in that region. He's taken and passed at least three of the exams, two out of his own pocket, but it's been over a year of searching and struggling. It's been demoralizing, to be honest, because we both thought this would be a slam-dunk with his math background, and that perhaps the PhD would offset his lack of industry experience and internships. We're both entering our 30s, which also makes me wonder if it is ""too late"" for either of us to break into this field.

I'm wondering if his limiting himself to less urban areas the Midwest is part of why he's having trouble with finding a job, or if there's more at play. This is a field that I am open to pursuing after graduation from graduate school, or maybe sooner if possible, but it sounds like P and FM aren't the hot tickets they were ten years ago."

Actuary EL Jobs,3,0,False,False,False,actuary,1488945701,True,"Hi all.  I'm hoping to get some perspective from you guys.  I graduated from a US News and Weekly top 5 college with a 3.9 GPA in May 2015.  I learned what the actuarial profession was in October 2016, started studying for P and FM and passed both (10 on each) in November and December of 2016 (I studied approximately 100 hours for each exam).  

The only thing is, I've never had a professional job or internship.  I did some resident life work and coached a high school sports team for fun but I've made a living since high school as a professional gambler (online poker mainly but fantasy sports and pretty much any zero-sum game).  Money isn't an issue, I've won enough money to comfortably live off my investment income (mostly quant trading based) but I'm looking for interesting colleagues and engaging projects to work on.  

I'm taking MFE this March and planning to start applying for jobs after.  Should I talk about my income from poker in interviews?  (It's higher than the starting salary at most actuarial firms and I don't want prospective employers to think I'm trying to demand a higher salary.)  I'm looking for general feedback from you on which companies would be most interested in hiring a candidate without internship experience and how I should frame my slightly off the beaten path background.

Calculating VaR with trade suspension,1,2,False,False,False,actuary,1488946431,True,"Dear users, I'm in the middle of learning how to calculate VaR/CVaR with Parametric/Historical/MC method.

Apparently, as we need to calculate log return, we cannot put them to zero, and it's also bad to give it the price of previous day (or the next day). I'm thinking about using linear interpolation.

I was wondering for those who passed MLC in the past few years what they used to practice for the exam.  I have ASM from my employer and finished the lessons, but I've heard that the ASM exams are not really indicative of the actual exam difficulty.

Did I screw up my internship?,15,9,False,False,False,actuary,1489257007,True,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I am in a bit of a pickle. I received an offer from an insurance company to be an actuarial intern in December, which I accepted. After I accepted it, I was sent a package of documents over email. In one marked ""Actuarial Training Program"", there was a line about a drug test saying ""(iii) the successful completion of a drug test, which will be initated 30-45 days prior to Start Date. AFTER receiving drug test instructions from your recrutier, you will have TWO(2) business days to complete your drug test"" with the internship starting in May, I assumed that meant that sometime in March-April they would contact me about the drug test. 

However, I was looking over another document I received, named the Welcome Package, which says ""any job offer you may receive is contingent upon your passing a urinalysis drug test before your start date. Your drug test must be scheduled AND taken no later than two(2) days from the date you verbally accept the offer of employment.""

I had not seen this information earlier, as I had only skimmed the documents when I first received them. I am also certain that if I had taken the test then, just as if I were to take it now, the test would pass. 

And to confuse matters even more, I received another email on February 13th saying welcome to the company, and a new person outside the recruiter talking about how she would guide me through the rest of the process.

Am I in the wrong here? Have I lost my internship? And is there any way for me to save it? Thank you for reading a lot, hope that I didn't bore you."

Need help figuring out if this is the right career for me,11,0,False,False,False,actuary,1489291849,True,"I am currently a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, trying to transfer to the Actuarial Science program here. The career attracted me because as far as making a decent living goes, something math-related is the only thing I can comprehend. I have tried to get into bio/chem (med route, dont wanna be a doctor) and the engineering discipline but the topics bore me and I don't think I am smart enough anyway.



There's my issue. I tried to convince myself that I am smart enough to be an actuary but I am starting to think that is not the case. I took 1 gen ed, a microeconomics course, a CS course, and insurance course last semester and got a record high GPA of 3.8. I thought the trend could continue this semester. Taking another gen ed, intermediate microeconomics, Actuarial Statistics, and Theory of Interest. The 2 math courses are extremely difficult but I am trying my best to push through. My Actuarial Stat midterm did not go well, despite me feeling extremely confident going into it. It seems I know how to calculate probabilities and distribution models, but I don't know how to derive them from a word problem. I take advantage of every possible office hours and spend hours on my own and with others studying this material but I still don't understand the concepts. Only the calculations.


Anyway sorry for the diary entry there, but have any of you been in the same boat? Were the introductory actuarial math courses difficult for you as well? I need to get As in both courses to be CONSIDERED for transfer, and my chances are bleak now.


TL;DR: Not as smart as I thought I was, thought I could be an actuary but having a hard time grasping concepts. Only reason I am pursuing this career is because other ""well-paying"" and ""secure"" jobs don't appeal to me. Truth be told, I don't even want to be an actuary, I just thought it was the only thing I can go for in order to make a decent living. Insurance bores the hell out of me."

Should a friend of mine give up on his quest to be an actuary?,3,0,False,False,False,actuary,1489606090,True,"EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted?

My friend has been trying to become an actuary for 2-3 years. The market is very very competitive. He's passed two exams but has stopped applying to focus on his 3rd exam (he says it's been awhile since he's passed the 2nd one so he has to pass the 3rd one to look good).

Meanwhile, he's been on less than 5 interviews (some phone ones as well.) From what I know about him I'd say he's a bad interviewer. Not very engaging or charismatic and I think he mentioned to me that he is one. Less than 5 interviews is over 2-3 YEARS I want to remind you. 

Meanwhile, I feel that this search for an actuary job is destroying his life. No hobbies. Stays in a job he hates. Doesn't date (he's almost 30) because he has low self esteem due to his job. Doesn't really explore programming, which he might actually be very good at (his dad is a programmer). Regular public FB status updates on how miserable is, ""GOD WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME"" posts, I don't think its healthy. 

I'm not even sure why he wants to be an actuary so bad. To my knowledge he hasn't ever job shadowed one. He just hangs out at actuarial outpost, reads about the cool benefits (brags to me how great they are), lives vicariously through the success stories, etc. 

To be honest, I have no idea what to do. 

What do you guys think? I was thinking of stop supporting this attempted career move once he turns 30 (this of course is very arbitrary).  I was advised to keep my mouth shut by a very good friend of mine (he is, afterall, trying very hard at passing exams.) "

[Update] A few mod notes,8,14,False,False,False,actuary,1489668096,True,"Hello /r/actuary.  I wanted to give you an update on how Automoderator is doing.  See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/5t4hku/a_few_mod_notes/) for its introduction.

Automoderator has done pretty well with the first set of rules.  We've had a few false positives, and I thank the users who have helped me work through those.  Some pretty reputable submitters had posts removed for silly reasons which helped tweak the rules, so if you're one of them, know you aren't alone.

I have tweaked our Automoderator rules to try to deal with one of /r/actuary's perennial issues: newbies asking the same questions over and over.  There is now a rule in place that accounts under a certain age will automatically have posts removed and be sent a message describing our weekly threads and the search function.  The message also says that they can let the moderators know if the removal is in error and then we may approve it from there.  

**There are a few things I need from you, the community**

* Please continue reporting and downvoting as appropriate.  Downvote = does not contribute to the discussion (not just you disagree).  Report = severely unprofessional, violates rules of reddit, etc.  If you wouldn't say the comment when making small talk at work or an actuarial conference, I don't think it's needed here, either.

* Please participate in the weekly threads, especially the Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday ones (Newbies, Careers, and Exams, respectively).  Since we're now suggesting a lot of posts be funneled into those threads, we need to make sure they are useful to the newbies that follow that rule.

* For the established professional actuaries out there, please continue submitting professional links, actuarial organization announcements, industry news, etc. to add to the subreddit discussion.  AMAs are also welcome, but follow the same rules as /r/AMA.

One other small thing: we had a few posters create job listings awhile ago, and [I asked about the community's thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/5xgxvz/community_question_do_we_want_job_listings_here/) on those.  What I decided to do was to funnel job postings to the Sunday Career Thread.  There are also strings attached, like needing to link to the job posting and/or provide an actual, corporate email attached to the listing.  If this doesn't work, we can change it.

As always, your comments and suggestions are welcome."

Another question: What if someone got their ASA in time before July 1, 2018 but didn't do anything extra towards their CERA. Would that still mean they have to do something different than just the ERM Module and ERM Exam to get a CERA after July 2018?

It also says, ""Candidates who have completed requirements under previous systems have them first moved to the current system using previous transition rules and then moved to the new system."" I have no clue what that means though, can anyone explain that?

"Just started looking into being an actuary, but unsure if it's the right path for me, any advice?",4,0,False,False,False,actuary,1489857770,True,"I've gone back and forth between so many careers, but I think I have finally managed to find something that I may enjoy doing. I do need to refresh myself on math, but I think I could handle it. Being 27, I was worried about being too old to try to start back into sophomore in college, but I'm not going to let that stop me.

I’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety, ocd, depression, bi polar disorder and sleep problems. I also tend to be slight paranoid always thinking about the ' what ifs'  I and the probability  I or something happening, I mention this because I'm not sure if any of this could prevent me from getting a job, Even though I am seeing therapists and taking lots of medicine for the issues.

Currently I'd like a career where I didn't really have to do presentations, dealing with clients ( I'd rather go through the manger), sales pitching or being in the public eye. I'm still trying to work on my issues so I think starting out those are things I could not handle currently, maybe/hopefully years later I can handle it better or as I get more confident, but not currently. So I guess a behind the scenes type career is what I'm looking for right now. I don't know if this matters, but I have a 3.4 G.P.A, it used to be around 3.6-3.7, but getting a C in a science class dropped me down. I want to be able to help others, but without (at least for now) without having to be in public eye that much. I can be social, but only with people I trust and even then I'm the quiet one who only really speaks when I have something to say and even then that's after I usually think it through before saying anything.

This user VioletINFP, I was looking through posts on another subreddit and found her/him and a part of a description she made sounded exactly like me, and I couldn't have put it any better, so I'm going to copy and paste a part of her post she made, not sure how to quote on here exactly.

“ I like working alone, but I don’t mind being in a group either (but not a lot of people because too many and I get really drained emotionally). I’m also the type of person who has a hard time asking questions and tries to figure out the problem on my own (I got yelled at a lot and told to stop asking stupid questions/ told that my opinion didn’t matter much/whenever I tried to give my opinion got told to be quiet when I was younger up to when I was 20 by people that I knew and didn’t know that well, so it’s been stuck with me and I got a defense mechanism to just keep quiet and figure things out on my own, not to ask questions -unless I truly can't figure it out in fear of annoying someone/seeming like I'm stupid and don't know anything), but I’m trying hard –seeing a therapist too- to change. I used to think I was shy, but I am good at putting on masks of happiness and having a chameleon personality (where my personality changes depending on who I am with).”

So, I'm hoping that one of these careers would be a good match for me. If not, then I'll start from square one again, I feel sort of overwhelmed trying to figure out which one, if any is right for me even after looking up things online.

If you don't think being an actuary would be a good match, let me know if you think of something else (I'm pretty open minded, I just want a career that will pay well, so I'm not having to penny pinch every month) that might work instead.

Thank you in advance for your help."

By say above average in R, I have coded many algorithms for calculating things like MLEs (multi parameter and relevant confidence intervals), rejection sampled data (and other MC methods), ridge and LASSO regression, and a plethora of numerical methods in mathematics (where I focused in pyhton but can apply to R).

Should I bother trying to focus more on say SQL/VBA that I feel decently comfortable with or just wait until I'm on the job to learn more of that and just continue learning advanced techniques in R so that I can try to shine when it comes to predictive modeling? I feel like so many people say they know VBA and Excel and show up knowing next to nothing so I feel like on paper, getting better at Excel won't stand out any more than it does now but so few entry level candidates know very little when it comes to actual programming, especially with an emphasis in statistical computing.

Also, what techniques are especially useful when it comes to predictive modeling in the actuarial career field? I know a lot of times people just use GLMs but if I can easily create different models to ensemble with little extra time or complexity, I feel like it would be very useful. Buzz words like random forests and nearest neighbors come to mind when I think about what to learn next.

Are any notes allowed on the exams?

Considering I am working full time, when should I take exam P? 

Is studying on the weekends only good enough? If not, what's recommended? Make a schedule?

Is finding a job easy with just one exam passed? I'd love to hear stories about how many exams you've passed/salary/etc.

"I am the <10%. EL of 7.6, 1488 practice problems, 460 hours of studying and failed MFE. Feeling a bit lost.",17,5,False,False,False,actuary,1490018010,True,"In total I did 1488 problems and studied 460 hours. I know this because I keep an excel file where I log all of my time and problems. I did every problem in the ASM manual except for the practice exams.

I thought if I had perfect preparation, I would for sure pass. 

I also did (included in the 1488 total) 19 ADAPT exams, 2 TIA exams, 1 SOA exam, and 2 ASM exams, all under exam conditions (timed, no notes, no breaks). 6 quizzes focusing on my weaknesses. The last 4 weeks was all practice exams. I purposely drew from a lot of sources so that I would be prepared for how different authors might ask different questions.

I will say that I never got a high pass on any of them. The final exam was a 24/30 on a level 6 exam. In hindsight, I never was able to get through every problem on the practice exams. 

I think the thing that did me in was speed. I didn't set the tempo I knew I had to set from the practice exams. 

With an hour left, I had roughly 11-13 unanswered problems. The final 10-12 problems, and 2 problems I skipped from the first 20 questions. Instead of using good judgment about which problems to work on, I ended up staying too long on many problems, and ended up not even getting to work on the final 6 as a result. I know now that I have to immediately skip and move on if I'm not nailing the problem. 

I don't feel like this bad performance is an indicator of my MFE content knowledge. I feel like I had a very strong grasp of ""what was going on"" theoretically. It just wasn't my day. But I don't have any excuses, I failed fair and square.

I was thinking for the next 4 months I could focus on speed, and make sure I'm nailing every problem in under 6 minutes. And if I don't get a problem in 6 minutes, determine what aspect of the problem is getting me hung up.

I still don't have a job as an actuary. I've been working as a non-actuarial pension analyst. So I'm gaining relevant experience.

TLDR;

-Failed MFE, despite what I think was optimal preparation

-Not working in an actuary, working in a very closely related field. Hoping to move into actuarial work as soon as I can

-I was thinking I could do practice problems (with an emphasis of speed) 1 day, then work on technical skills (VBA, Excel, SQL) on the next day, and repeat until July (with more emphasis on practice exams in the final month)

Seeking Career Advice,6,1,False,False,False,actuary,1490216592,True,"Hey y'all,

In June of last year I graduated from a top university studying math with a minor in statistics and a citation in Modern Chinese and a 3.2 GPA. 

Until about January of this year I worked on a software project with two friends who graduated with me. One handled the stats, one handled finances, I was the code monkey. We built a sports betting system that focused on exploiting weak bookmakers and finding arbitrage opportunities. It was moderately successful, but overall didn't make that much money* and was a huge timesink. As the code monkey, I was responsible for writing the code that gathered data on lines being offered as close to instantaneously as possible, and also writing the code that gathered relevant match data and historical lines data to build the stats guys' models and backtest them. The ""finance"" guy had a spare 70k to bankroll us, but was also responsible for setting up the accounts on various sites, which included doing things like setting up proxies so we could bet on sites that don't allow Americans**.

(* - It did decently actually in terms of beating lines, but our project encountered lots of problems. These sites don't like winning bettors and we got our accounts closed multiple times, including one shitty offshore site just straight up taking our money period. After that we have basically no profit to show for it)

(** - Arbitrage opportunities occurred far and away most frequently between books with different customer bases)

During this time I also played ridiculous amounts of small stakes poker and was moderately successful, making about $10k.

Round about January I think we realized we weren't going to make any real money on this. Actually the stats guy and finance guy had already moved on since I bore the brunt of the work and gotten jobs, with the former waiting for me to finish my end before he dug into modeling and the latter never actually having too intensive of a role. I had moved back in with my folks in the summer and now I had to actually get a job. Around that time I decided being an actuary was a career path that was interesting and one for which I might be well-suited.

Monday I passed P/1.

Reading through some of the other recent resume/interview advice on here, people are saying that being nine months out of school with absolutely no full-time work experience is a killer. However I've also heard people say that having something to show for your time out of the workforce counts for something. 

On one hand, I feel like I was working on a project that was non-trivial and perhaps interesting to some of the more statistically-minded.

On the other, it failed and I can't imagine interviewers are going to like to hear the I've been out of work for nine months so I could take a shot at being a professional gambler.

What are your thoughts on this? How qualified am I ""at a glance"" as a grad from a top-tier school with a quantitative major/secondary but mediocre GPA? How damning is the gap in work experience and should I or should I not bring up the sports-betting/poker? Does one exam basically count for nothing?

Thanks in advance"

For those of you who have experience/or know someone working at Wills Towers Watson.,16,1,False,False,False,actuary,1490451752,True,"Hey I'm about to B.S in Actuarial sciences and take exams 1 and 2. Do any of you have any experience or have happened to start off working at Wills Towers? The position they're hiring for is a retirement Analyst (however they keep saying it’s an actuarial analyst) the only thing I'm concerned about is 

A. They don't seem to really care about exams passed or even raise your pay much when you pass exams (which is to be expected of a consulting firm). 
B. They don't seem to really give you time to study exams (infact after the 4th exam they don't even seem to encourage you to take anymore.

Unfortunately they're pretty much the only place hiring in my area that will benefit me and my GPA is sadly only around a 2.5 (switched majors late in the game electrical engineering killed my GPA). 

So my question is 

Would it be better for me to work there ? Or find a random finance job out of state since most firms hiring actuaries prefer for the actuaries to be near them? I’m assuming having actuarial analyst on my resume will look really good, but will moving closer to areas that actually have actuary jobs be better?

Doing VEE AS outside of university,5,2,False,False,False,actuary,1490458030,True,"I'd like to complete my VEE Applied Statistics before the SOA transitions to the new system next year.

Passed Exam P! Advice for FM?,17,13,False,False,False,actuary,1490463086,True,"I realize that the first test may not be a huge deal, but I'm super glad I got [a preliminary pass](http://imgur.com/GpSuxrI). (Does a preliminary pass mean that I might not have passed?)

Are there real benefits to captives or is it accounting wizardry?,7,7,False,False,False,actuary,1490467808,True,"From what I understand, captives are (re)insurance companies owned by a parent insurance company.

Captives re-insure some of the risks from the insurance company and as a result the insurance company may reduce its reserves and surplus. But now, isn't the capital strain on the captive? The total amount of reserves (insurance company + captive company) decreased but the amount of future liabilities did not.

Given an amount, x, of future obligations and f(x) = the prescribed amount of statutory reserves required, how does moving x between insurance company and captive affect f(x)?

The only way I can seem to come to terms with it is if the captive doesn't need to hold regulatory reserves (or isn't publicly reported) which seems like regulatory-loophole-exploitation.

Also, how does the bank, and surplus note come into play? It sounds like the bank helps the captive put up ""collateral"" or a letter of credit for re-insuring the insurance company. But where does the captive get the assets to back the collateral? If its from the premiums from the insurance company then isn't this all a zero-sum arrangement?

This whole arrangement sounds like rearranging grease on a pizza and saying we don't need as many napkins anymore.

Can someone clear up any misunderstandings I have about captives?"

"Exam MLC question, Bathroom break",5,2,False,False,False,actuary,1490480995,True,"So for all the other preliminary exams I've taken were CBT and were done in a prometric testing center, where they would allow you to take the bathroom break while the clock still ticks.

Since Exam MLC is paper based, do they allow you to take bathroom break in between with the clock still running or is that not allowed? Do they have lockers prepared for the test takers so that they can put away their notes, etc.? I couldn't find any information regarding this (specifically for paper exams) on the MLC page.

Or is it the case that the answer to my questions vary wildly depending on the testing location?

I know this is a bit of a weird question, but sitting through a 4 hour exam while holding my coffee urine will be very distracting... If they are so cruel as to allow no breaks under any circumstances, then I need to start breaking my caffeine addiction now. "

I didn't put my gpa because it sucks. It REALLY sucks. I probably have around half the average gpa of the resumes posted here. I have no idea what to do about that. I am trying to boost it up, but it still probably won't be high enough at the end.

I do hope to negate some of that by enhancing other aspects of myself; So I tried putting my volunteering activities. Idk if it helps.

I have a bachelor's degree in Math, which I know many actuaries also have. Some have a dual degree or a minor in economics/finance, which I do not have.

I don't have a very strong background in economics/finance. I don't know too much about insurance or contracts or any of that.

I know very well that cramming in 3 weeks is a really bad idea, but I have work/school from 7:30 AM till 11:30 PM each day (after which I have to study for classes), so spreading it out wasn't much of an option.

It's bugging me out a bit, since I can't seem to figure out when to solve it completely, and when to leave them until combining to formulas - or even which direction to go! I don't want to get stuck here, as I still have (probably) 75% of the material to go. Do you guys have any tips?"

Is majoring in Actuarial Science only a bad idea due to the fact that if you can not get a job as an Actuary then you are basically stuck? How are actuaries with a Mathematics major viewed compared to actuaries with a Finance or Economics major?

Significant changes in FM syllabus for June 2017 - advice on new materal,1,1,False,False,False,actuary,1490796483,True,"Hi all,

I was planning on taking the April FM exam, but life got in the way and I put it off to June. Comparing the two syllabuses it looks like there's a large portion removed, specifically the Financial Economics section, which I'm more than alright with.

However, in the June 2017 syllabus, they go a bit more in depth with Interest Rate Swaps and added on Determinants of Interest Rates. Will ADAPT be proficient in teaching these concepts? I have the 11th edition ASM manual for FM which doesn't seem to cover these.

How does one split their time between learning to actually be good at their job (I tend to go home and still do some office work just ot make sure it is of good quality... not sure how feasible this is long term)?

Pre-Existing Conditions and the ACA,11,27,False,False,False,actuary,1490824661,True,"Hi all,

In the interest of becoming a more informed citizen regarding the recent legislative battles over the ACA, I've been reading up on what exactly the ACA entails (tbh I never fussed about it, I had insurance so it didn't really concern me at the time or since), and in the course of my reading developed some questions. So who better to ask than a bunch of actuaries?

One thing I read is that the ACA has made it so that applicants seeking health insurance cannot be refused on the basis of pre-existing conditions. Perhaps it is clearer to somebody who has read the actual bill, but this seems confusing to me. So here are my questions regarding how the Pre-Existing Conditions business works:

1) Can insurance companies charge customers who come to them with pre-existing conditions super high rates? Say I want to purchase health insurance and I have cancer. Even though I can't be refused coverage, cant the insurance company just charge me $30000/month for coverage?

2) If the answer to the above is no - aren't insurance companies guaranteed to have to insure some customers at a loss? And if so, how are these companies being compensated for having to do so? "

Planning out my next exams. Currently have passed P, FM, C. Taking S in May (I know this is a weird order, long story). For now let's assume I pass - if I don't obviously plans will change. Going for CAS not SOA.

From what I understand, MFE is getting easier in July (no more stochastic calculus, addition of FM material I already know), then potentially getting harder in 2018 when it becomes IFM (addition of corporate finance and portfolio theory).

The only other exam it makes sense to take next is 5. However no CAS plans to change 5 from what I am aware of.

So does it make sense to shoot for MFE in July to give myself two chances while it is ""easier""? Or am I missing something here and it makes sense to take 5 next? This would only give me 2 months which is quick....but I think i can do it since I already know some of the stuff from FM (took last August).

dear SOA/CAS, plz stop changing so much shit while I'm in the middle of taking your tests. sincerely everyone.

(I currently have 4 exams as a Junior at a CAE.)

From one perspective, I have had one of my professors claim that having more exams cannot possibly hurt potential candidates, as companies that are intimidated by people leaving college with 4-5 exams are probably not companies that they should want to work at anyways.

The other side, however, claims that passing too many exams makes candidates unattractive for companies, as it causes these students to be difficult to price, as there is a mismatch between their experience and exam knowledge.  These people tend to claim that passing too many exams too early in their career limits their earnings potential, so it is better to slow down.

Best Course of Action: Exams MFE and C,6,2,False,False,False,actuary,1491362573,True,"Looking forward to this summer and the summer of 2018, I'm trying to determine the best course of action with these two exams. I also have one university course I'm trying to take during either of the summers.

My two options are as follows: 

1) Take my university course this summer, followed by Exam C in October. This would give me the summer to learn the material with ASM and go at a relatively slow pace. I would then plan take MFE in July 2018, having taken a university course Spring 2018 prepping for MFE.

2) Plan to take MFE this July, with 30 days learning the material with ASM followed by 30 days of Adapt. I would then take a week off before preparing for C. This would give me 50 days to learn the material with ASM followed by 30 days of Adapt. I would then take my university course in the Summer of 2018.

Thoughts on Option 1:
I would have plenty of study time for both exams, but I would have to be thinking about exams until July 2018. I would really like to not have to do this. 

Thoughts on Option 2: 
I would potentially be rushed studying for both exams (thoughts on this?), but would finally have an exam free summer in 2018, where I could enjoy myself and focus on an internship (fingers crossed). 



Thoughts on my two options? I would prefer to get the two exams out the way this year(will I have enough prep time for these two?), and not have to think about any more exams until I'm employed.

Side note - I was able to pass Exam P with my only preparation being a university course teaching the material followed by less than two weeks of grinding Adapt.

Thanks for any input! 



Edit- Main question wanting an answer to: Is 50 days of ASM a sufficient amount of time to learn the information for C? "

The actuarial field is growing, and so is the quality of candidates. I have 4 exams, and am now seeing many new hires starting at the same level. For college students, be prepared to come in and produce quality work.

For those in actuarial student programs, try not to be spoonfed your career advancement. Exams are so important, but try and network and meet new people at your level and above you. It will be very beneficial in the profession. Connections are huge for promotions and advancement opportunities.

If you think actuarial work is not for you, don't fret. If you have 0 geographical restrictions you will be able to high high quality, high paying analyst work outside of the industry. Be prepared to defend your work though, as my new firm didn't even know what actuarial work was (large IB.)

Be sure to have fun. Enjoy life. I've connected with over 120 actuaries at my firm, and many just watch the days go by while they take exams and sit in spreadsheets. Work is vital, but work to live, not live to work.

I've used Excel a lot before but I'm not familiar with VBA/macros. Thank you!
[Rant] This is frustrating,66,7,False,False,False,actuary,1491796984,True,"Throwaway. I just wanted to post this so I can finally say it somewhere, so please bear with me:

I'm about a year out of college and I've got no job, and I'm still trying. The market's hard, and I've got to deal with it. I don't know what to say to my parents who slogged their asses off to pay 200 grand for my education at a top 20 university, and are looking at me crouching over my study table hoping I pass or have at least something to start my career with.

I keep asking where I went wrong, and I don't know. I do have the exams, I'm going onto my 4th exam because some say it's fine and I don't need to worry about 'too many exams', and I'm done with my VEEs. I have the skills and I can demonstrate them. I went through my career center and a few actuaries for the usual 'resume review' and 'interview prep' two dozen times to get comfortable, and come career fair time I couldn't even submit my resume to 75% of the companies out there because I didn't have an unrestricted right to work in the country.

I did land a paid internship but it got cancelled halfway due to a governmental issue, so there went junior year, and there's no internship to show for it, and that usually means it's pointless to even list my skills. There's a gap between my exams and people keep thinking I failed them, but I can't write on my cover letter (I'm not sure how many read them) that I was recovering from something pretty major.

I did network with people but aside from a LinkedIn greeting every Christmas I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm still in touch with a few people but I'm pretty sure most of them know I'm shit outta luck, they can smell the desperation now that I tried so hard to hide. There's nothing in my own country, and I keep applying thinking there's a shot at sponsorship at the places where they do have a record of sponsoring, but a lot of them don't seem to sponsor anymore. I've got barely any time left on my OPT and all I can think of is whether I can pass that exam that's two months away.

I'm trying to be positive, I swear I'm trying really hard but this is close to breaking me. I don't know if I can maintain that smile anymore when talking to people and recruiters. I know this is the line for me and I really want to get in, but my drive's been wearing away fast."

There's no closure and nothing to take the the place of studying that gives a feeling of success upon accomplishment.

Normal pastime activities like reading, watching TV, or playing video games feel empty. I think I need something that feels like it actually matters, but I'm struggling to get motivated enough to do anything.

I've done some reading on a similar phenomenon amongst PhD graduates. So I'm hoping that if any of folks here have had similar post-credential experiences, you can shed light on how to got through it. I'm considering finding a therapist if I can't shake the feeling soon.

I Need Some Honest Advice,12,0,False,False,False,actuary,1492004744,True,"Long post, I apologize. 

I discovered this subreddit semi-recently, and I have read all the reasons that people have said NOT to major in Actuarial Science. I am now worried that I may have made a huge mistake.

I am a student at Georgia State University and am finishing my Sophomore year. I will be taking Exam FM (My first) in June and am planning to take Exam P in December. I currently work as an RA and have a GPA of 4.22 on a 4.3 scale. I have made Dean's List every semester.

I give you this information because I'm not sure if my own personal situation changes things. I am currently an Actuarial Science major and I chose this major due to the exam prep courses and the reimbursement options. The head of the program is an FSA designated actuary who I have personally spoke with and has told me that so long as I complete 3 exams and an internship by graduation, I should have little difficulty finding a job. I KNOW that I want to be an actuary.

I am on track to graduate early and I could potentially do a double major in another business field such as finance and graduate in May, 2019. I am scheduled to speak with my adviser regarding this soon. 

My question is this: Is it really going to be worth it to do this double major, and is there anything else that I should do to help myself, or am I worrying too much? Have I screwed myself? I apologize if this post is rambling, I didn't want to leave out any information. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your fast and helpful responses. I really appreciate it.

Edit 2: My advisor got back with me. In order to double major in Finance, I only need to take an extra five courses. I see no reason not to go for it, based on what I've heard here. I of course also plan to keep up with exams, networking, and internships. Thank you again to everyone!"

Finance Major vs. Math Major,20,1,False,False,False,actuary,1492032055,True,"Before anyone roasts me for not googling this, I promise I did and I could not find much on this specific question.

My university only offers a math major with a concentration in actuarial science. Currently that's what I'm doing with a finance minor. This seems to be the common path with people planning on joining the actuarial field at my school.

My question is: would it be beneficial to double major with finance? Would doing a finance major with a math minor be acceptable? Or should I just stick with the current path?

Money is not an issue as my current job pays my tuition but obviously I don't want to waste time. Currently I'm a little behind. I will be going into my 3rd year in the fall but still a sophomore credit wise with no substantial math classes, so a finance major would probably help graduate faster because I started out as an accounting major and have a lot of business classes and gen-eds.

Pursuing a career in actuarial while in the reserves/guard,5,3,False,False,False,actuary,1492082570,True,"Not been able to really find anything on the topic through google.

Currently I work nights at a company that pays my tuition in full. It's a great setup however I would like to be able to complete internships while in school and my schedule will make this extremely difficult. I work from around 12am-6am, M-F.

I have considered for a while joining the reserves or the guard to pay for school and to serve my country. 

If I'm in a contract and required to go to drills on weekends, do you think I'll have a hard time getting internships, and more importantly a job out of college? I'm mostly concerned if this will help me or hinder me once I graduate. It's currently the best alternative to my current situation and would allow me to have more time for studying and a schedule more suited for internships and classes.

Actuarial Path and advice (UK),24,3,False,False,False,actuary,1492127181,True,"So I've been browsing this subreddit quite a bit and the information and advice on exams along with reading about others' experience is a really nice addition to the research I've been doing on this career.

Unfortunately I haven't found that many threads based in the UK here, not that it's much of a problem since I have a good idea of what to do. However I would like to ask for some guidance. 

I'm going to be doing my GCSEs next month and I would like to have a firm career path planned. I know I want to study maths at Cambridge university and am willing to put in all the work required and more for it. 

I would like to know, what kind of skill sets and experiences should I gain over the next two years in college that will really help me stand out or make me more desirable as a candidate who wants to study maths there.

Also, I know that statistics and probability and anything like that is definitely something I should take when I have options, what other modules/topics are recommended? 

Also how difficult is it right to find a job or gain an internship upon graduating university? 

Also, at what point do you *really* gain responsibilities in your actuarial career? Because honestly, the only thing putting me off is the fact that I'm afraid I'll make a mistake and cause some huge uproar by, I don't know, mixing up important data or creating the wrong model or whatnot. 

Like, I understand when you're starting off you're probably left to handle spreadsheets and participating in probjecrs where you're very closely superivised but once you're set free into the bone crushing world of actuarial work, do you not feel like you're making a mistake in your work or you feel like you don't have the sufficient knowledge to complete a task?
Like when do you know that you *don't know* what to do on a task and how do you overcome it?

Apologies for the long post and if I don't make sense. I will add more any further questions later on. Also please excuse any grammatical errors as typing on the phone can be a bit taxing.

Exam C after FM/P,11,3,False,False,False,actuary,1492452888,True,Just passed exam FM and I don't know what exam to take next. I know MFE is typical but I have a course at school in fall that almost covers that exam perfectly so I want to wait until early next year for it. I also know that exam C is changing a lot after February of 2018 so I think I want to finish it before then. Is it practical to take C after FM/P or do I need to take MLC first?

When did your job become interesting?,4,8,False,False,False,actuary,1492645236,True,"I've been in P&C for a few years now, having gained experience in the major actuarial functions. Initially I found the work pretty interesting and challenging. There were times when I was excited about my work.

Generally speaking though, pricing was pure drudgery, and now I'm growing to resent my job more and more. I'm curious if my experience is unique to my company or pretty standard for the industry.

Without divulging too much information, pricing analysts make up the majority of the department, which I imagine would be the case at most insurers. These roles, however, require little thought whatsoever. Credentialed actuaries have nearly all transitioned within the department to analytics while the ones who remain in pricing are incredibly bored, as these roles kill creativity and the desire to innovate (I'm hoping this is unique to my company- this is my biggest gripe). We run indications, get feedback from superiors, act like the proposed changes are our own, present to underwriting and the field, and capitulate to their whims (which is generally based on anecdotal information from producers).


In my experience, in order to be a successful actuary in pricing or reserving, the key proficiencies are copying and pasting and updating dates for database runs or queries. If you want to be a good actuary, having an intuition regarding the reasonableness of data is a great skill to have, though nothing on the exam syllabus truly fosters this for real world application. Instead of providing something useful to learn, there's just another list to commit to short-term memory (see steps in a reserve review, #1).



TLDR I can't tell if my experience is unique to my company or systemic. Were my expectations unreasonable? I can't study for a job I don't enjoy, and I'm not sure if switching companies is the answer or simply the key to more suffering."
M.Sc. Applied Mathematics in Germany,8,4,False,False,False,actuary,1492667953,True,"Hello /r/actuary, I am considering doing a Master's programme in Germany, and I wonder what are the top courses to take in the country. Specifically, I intend to pursue mathematical finance and actuarial science. As I understand it, there is not much of a rankings system in place in Germany; however, there are a few factors that come to my mind when I try to assess this:

1. Rigor of the course material. I assume that this is uniform across nearly all universities however.
2. Breadth of courses. Will I be only restricted to courses in mathematics?
3. Employability/Connections with employers. This might be the most important factor. It's a combination of ""who comes to this university to recruit"" and ""how well am I prepared to enter a job by the course"".

Based on these factors, and others that I may have missed, what do you consider to be the best place to study? Based on my research, I have found that the University of Ulm and Technische Universitat Muenchen (TU Munich) appear to be the best, but seeing rankings can only tell me so much. I understand that I must also learn German, and I am fully willing to put in that effort, however I cannot expect to reach a level of proficiency before I send off my applications and documents by this month or the next, so I am currently only looking at English-language Masters programmes."

Paying taxes on exam/study expenses,9,0,False,False,False,actuary,1492700263,True,"Hi all, I've just started work as an actuarial student and am ready to start studying for my next exam. My employer reimburses me for study expenses (for study manuals, exam fees etc.) if I submit the receipts, but those reimbursements show up in my paycheck and are taxed like income, which means I'm on the hook for a good chunk of my study expenses. (It's better than the 100% I paid when I wasn't working as an actuary, but still!)

Is this normal? Before I worked here, I worked in insurance in a non-actuarial role, and my employer signed me up for a licensing class and sent me a textbook that I didn't have to pay for. I expected exam expenses to work the same way. I doubt I can change my employer's policy since I work for a big company, but this seems weird. How does reimbursement work with other people's employers?"

Is it significantly harder to get an actuarial job on the West Coast?,15,3,False,False,False,actuary,1492720597,True,"Edit: I just meant the West in general, not just the coast (particularly, Denver & Seattle metro).

Are there any opportunities near Seattle or Denver? I'm not sure how to find out what the major companies in each city are, or how to find if they're hiring.

(I grew up in NYC and want to get out of there as quick as possible. Connecticut is nicer, but still pretty similar, and Hartford doesn't seem to have much in it when I visited.

How beneficial would an actuarial program be to me at University?,5,0,False,False,False,actuary,1492734429,True,"I am currently attending a junior college and looking to transfer to a University soon.

3 or 4 exams for an EL Position in NYC?,18,0,False,False,False,actuary,1492786456,True,"Hey all! I posted before regarding my failure to get even an interview for an internship thus far, despite good credentials. I'm working towards getting one, and some potential opportunities are looking good. General consensus in the other thread was that I should have more than 1 exam for an internship, and that I should omit my high SAT score. Other than that, there weren't any red flags.

So, assuming I manage to get an actuarial or finance internship before I graduate, should I aim at 3 exams or 4 for graduation? I took both P and FM with only a few weeks (2 for P and 3 for FM) of studying for each, and want to give myself the time to properly study for MFE now.

Work Situation,4,5,False,False,False,actuary,1492788657,True,"I think our actuarial department needs a new hire.  Our workloads are high (I work 50+ hours per week), we have actuarial projects/work that we're leaving on the table, and I could reallocate a lot of EL level work to an analyst to free up more time for me.

However, while I am about to be an FSA (and probably be promoted), I am not a manager.  On a recent campus recruiting trip for another department, we met a strong EL candidate who went under the radar.

Our senior manager actuary (my boss) is reluctant to hire anyone right now because he doesn't know what that person would do (because no one has pulled out a job case).  

Our 2 managers (we share the same boss) have not acted to hire anyone new even with rising workloads.  Even the actuary who recently fired one of their direct reports hasn't made any attempt at hiring anyone to replace them (partially because I took on some of the higher level work that person was slated to do).  The other manager has no interest in a new analyst.  

Is it a bad move to propose an open position to my boss (senior actuary) with specs for potential projects that this person could take over?  I am not a designated manager now so I feel like I'm stepping on people's toes.  I also don't know if its simply out of place."

"Late career shift at middle age, from software to actuarial work",19,2,False,False,False,actuary,1493250601,True,"Hi.  I'm an EE/CS grad with plenty of software development experience (20 years' worth), working recently on statistics/prediction applications.  I also have an MFE (financial mathematics, statistics) but have been unable to get quant work with this.  The content of the MFE has quite a bit of overlap with actuarial science, so I decided to sit some actuarial exams for the heck of it.  So far I've sat 4 and got through them, so now that I've progressed this far, the thought of actually doing something with this is coming up.

So what are the possibilities for someone in my situation?  Is software development experience something I can leverage in an actuarial job?  Is the actuarial field less age-discriminatory than software? (this is something that's got me worried, as I'm not getting any younger, and I'm really not interested in moving into software development management).  Is it easier to find work as an actuary than a quant?

Question about securing a first job,17,0,False,False,False,actuary,1493824141,True,"I'm sure you guys are sick of questions like this, but I would be truly grateful for some advice. 

At this point, I've been a graduate with a BS in Mathematical Sciences (Actuarial) and a minor in  Computer Sciences since last November, with a 3.3 GPA, Exams P and FM passed while in school, and am currently studying for the July MFE exam.

Up until this point, my only experience is as a part time Calculus/Statistics tutor since September of last year.

As a result of a combination of my school not having a very developed actuarial program, and me not picking up the slack, so far I haven't been able to secure an actuarial internship for this summer. I know it should be way too late, however throughout the past few months I've found and applied to a handful of different internships all over the country, making it clear I'd be willing and eager to relocate. (For instance, for whatever reason it looks like an internship in Jacksonville with allstate opened up in the last week looking for recent graduates). 

For the last month or so, I've also been applying to the underwriting and risk management  related summer internship positions that have been posted recently. I'm not sure how likely it is to secure an internship out of state though, no matter how clear I try to make it that I'm in it for the long run. I'm not really holding out much hope for an internship this summer.

LONG STORY SHORT- For reasons I won't waste your time trying to explain, I'm out of sync and fear that after this summer, even if I do pass the MFE exam, I'll be out of the running for anything directly actuarial related (internship or otherwise). In addition, it's starting to seem like any Business or Financial analyst position I look at either requires way more programming experience than I have, or I appear overqualified when I leave actuarial exams on my resume so it doesn't look like I've been doing absolutely nothing these past few months.

How can I get back on track? Is there any way for me to sneak my way into an insurance company as an intern (paid or otherwise) for the fall? Is there any shot in hell of me getting any of these out of state internships? Is my only option graduate school?

Basically - what am I not doing now that I'm going to regret this fall?

I have exam P coming up in 2 weeks, and want to get some advice!

The materials that TIA teaches in the video seem to be too ""basic"" and the question it gives me is like so different that I always wonder whether i am in right section.

Entry Level Advice,4,0,False,False,False,actuary,1494206211,True,"Hello all,

I'm looking for some guidance in locking down an entry level position in the NYC metro area. To start, here is my brief background:

1. Graduated in 2011 from Northeastern University with a B.S. in Mathematics (have 3 publications under my name prior to graduation among other honors and Deans List awards)
2. One year experience working in finance
3. Five years experience working in a start-up private laboratory (working with health insurers/contracting/projections/financial evaluations/cost+benefit analyses, a lot of face to face with potential clients)
4. Passed Exam P in March
5. Strong grasp of Excel, some VBA
6. Currently studying for FM and starting to work on SAS
7. Effective communicator and a team/goal oriented leader

I've gotten referrals to Prudential in Newark (no response from HR), Mercer, MetLife, and New York Life. I've been told to try using a recruiter (D.W. Simpson) and that hasn't worked out so far. Essentially I'd like to know if there is anything I could add or work on to make myself a more appealing candidate to land an interview. I deem myself a ""people person"" and due to my experience working on the front lines of a start up laboratory which has grown to a multimillion dollar company I'm confident I could win some hearts and minds.

Which course in R should I take?,7,1,False,False,False,actuary,1494339994,True,"My school is offering two new courses for math actuarial students in preparation to the new curriculum and the change to insurance companies using R more often. The two courses come out in about a year, and I am currently a sophomore. Both courses are equally interesting, but with my double major as well as fitting VEE requirements into my degree I can only take one. So here are the courses and their descriptions.

MATH 455: Intro to Regression Models

This course covers mathematical foundation and practical implementations of linear and generalized linear regression models. Topics include estimation and diagnostics of linear model, transformations of variables, model selection, polynomial regression and logistic regression. The emphasis of the course will be on applications.

MATH 457: Intro to Statistical Learning

Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. This course covers such topics as regression, classification, resampling, model selection, regularization, tree-based methods, support vector machine, principal components analysis and clustering methods. It concentrates more on the applications of the methods and provides students with valuable hands-on experience. 

I honestly have no idea which one is more applicable to the work force. I just want to take the course in which the material I learn will be used regularly (doesn't necessarily have to be actuary if you know other economics/mathematic jobs that would use the modeling from these courses)."

My strategy was to read through the material and do a limited number of practice problems (done), then move on to ADAPT 5-question quizzes until I felt comfortable with each section (in progress), then take ADAPT practice exams and do flash cards to memorize any formulas I'm still struggling with at that time, targeting an earned level of 7 or above by exam day. 

I have been giving almost all my spare time to studying and taking 9 hours a week off work to study as well, but I'm not getting any better at this stuff. I'm struggling with the same problems as before (simple problems in probability functions, deductibles, etc.) and am getting anxious that I could fail after putting in more time studying for this exam than I ever have before. I got a 9 on Exam P a few years ago, so it's not like I am incapable of doing probability-type problems.

Advice on what to take in college to build Actuarial skills,6,1,False,False,False,actuary,1494610742,True,"So I am currently a finance major and want to go into investments (potentially), but the program here isn't as quantitative as I would like to be exposed to.

I have 3.5 semesters free so I am trying to see what I can fill in terms of coursework (that is after accounting for all of my finance courses). What advice would actuaries today give in terms of what I should learn/focus on (both hard skills like math/programming but also soft like speaking & presentation; what do you feel is needed)?

College student seeking advice,2,2,False,False,False,actuary,1494630151,True,"To give a little background:


-Applied and Computational Math Sciences Major with a focus in Mathematical Economics at a top 50 University

-Good GPA (>3.6)

-No relevant work experience

-No internship lined up for summer 

-No exams

-Projected graduation early 2019 (Junior but I switched majors so I need an extra quarter or two to graduate)

I *recently* decided I wanted to pursue a career as an actuary (like fucking yesterday), and I have a few questions about what to do next. I am currently taking a Probability I course and I am registered to take Probability II this summer (B-term ~7/20-8/20). In addition I am registered to take real analysis this summer (full-term ~6/20-8/20). 

I am considering taking the P exam in September after I have taken Probability II, which would cover the syllabus for the P exam. I am concerned that taking the exam in September would mean I won't find out if I pass until after I apply to internships for next summer (2018), and without ANY relevant work experience I don't know if getting an internship will be possible with no exams. 

The other option I have is to study on my own and take the P exam in July. I would only have about a month to study for the exam but I would still be coming fresh of a probability I course so I won't be starting from scratch. If I do this route I probably won't be able to take a real analysis class and cram for the P exam at the same time although I suppose it's doable. Also, taking the Probability II class after taking the P exam will be pretty redundant but it is a prereq for higher level classes (stochastic processes). 

In addition to the P exam I was wondering if there is anything else I can do to boost my chances of an internship? I am going to become a member of my school's actuary club ASAP, but I was wondering if something like a certificate of proficiency in excel would be useful?

Whoa that post turned out to be longer than I thought! What do you guys think I should do? Any advice is welcome.

Graduated college with a 2.6 GPA, 2 exams, no internship. Resume never made it past the automated system (rightfully so). 8 month gap between graduation and my first job because I was strictly applying to actuarial positions with no luck. Settled for a data analyst position , passed another exam , gained some technical skills (Excel, VBA, SQL) while working there for a year. Decided that field wasn't for me, started applying to insurance companies via SOA directory, literally emailed everyone in the directory within the New York City area (not kidding, pretty sure I emailed everyone from A-Z) . Got a couple of interviews and accepted a position at a health company exactly a week ago. 

Long story short, don't give up. If your resume is shit, work towards bettering it. Take an analyst position that gives you working experience in Excel, SQL, or anything statistical programming language. Take exams, learn how to speak to people ( I was terrible at interacting with people, one actuary i emailed told me to try toastmasters. signed up for a couple sessions and now I'm a lot better at speaking and articulating my thoughts ) Hope this helps"
I need help on a question for Exam P.,2,8,False,False,False,actuary,1494886078,True,"Hello friends, I have stumbled upon a question while I was doing practice problems on the Actex Exam P Manual.

I understand that the first term when X=Y is 11 and from there the next pair that matches this criteria is when it increases by 12. I have figured out that it is 25 / 100^2. However, is there an algebraic way to solve this question? If the term was 1000, it would take forever writing out the numbers. I have looked online and the manual solution but I cannot seem to vision this problem in an algebraical way? If you can help me and explain, that would be really great as I am interested in seeing the reasonings. Thanks! "

I have been studying the ASM manual made for the old FM Exam. I just got onto the bonds which is chapter 8. The financial economics is chapter 10-20 which focus on derivatives.

My question is what does the word payment mean in this situation and what does it mean to have a payment of 144 at time 2 and another payment of 144 at time 3? 

It kind of seems like when it asks for the present value of a payment of 144 at time 2 and a payment of 144 at time 3 it means the present value where we can get to time 2 and remove 144 and then get to time three and remove another 144 and then be left with nothing.  "

How can I squeeze anything out of this? I work for a house flipper. We renovate homes he bought on a foreclosure auction. 

I do dirty work. Painting, flooring, tiles, carpentry, etc. However, if theres anything good I can say about myself its this: I give alot of input on ""my vision"" on how the home should look. I am sometimes stubborn on my opinions and insist on them, but i'm never pushy. He takes my advice quite often, and when he does the houses sell rather fast, and sometimes with multiple offers. I never do anything with numbers, or excel or anything.  The only thing I do on a computer is ""interior design research"", which is just browsing pintrest to get new ideas. When he leaves to run errands, he leaves me in charge, but in our field nobody has an official title (i.e. manager, supervisor, etc.). 

I have alot of time off in this job. When we finish a house, i have to wait, sometimes 2-3 weeks, before he buys another house we can start. So in those ""gaps"" I have some other people that will always take me for work. I worked for many different people and they are always satisfied my work. I have a very ambitious heart and I guarantee that whoever hires me will not regret it. 

The problem is that I am not a desireable candidate on paper. I have no reason for anybody to hire me for an EL position. I understand I need to find a data analyst job or something similar first, and then work my way up to an actuary job. But theres some internships I can apply for that my friends can give me a good word. I want to at least have something presentable.

Finally secured an EL position! Here's some advice for everyone that can't find a job,10,63,False,False,False,actuary,1495322445,True,"I am bragging a little bit but mostly I want to inspire confidence in the entry level job seekers in similar situations. My situation:

-3 exams, all after graduating
-2.97 GPA
-0 internships
-an entry level processing job at an investment bank for 6 months that could not be less relevant to actuarial
-I'm not very outgoing, really thought interviews would be my downfall
-out of school for 2.5 years, the first two years spent delivering pizza

What helped:

-the bank job. Having any professional experience at all is really easy to sell in an interview. Any office job can be talked up in terms of transferable skills, working with a team, using computer programs, etc

-passing 3 exams over 14 months

- The Infinite Actuary technical skills course. Can not stress this enough. It's been brought up by all of my interviewers and even though most of the course is introductory (except Excel stuff goes over a lot of functions), I was at least able to say it gave me comfortability working with large data sets, basic concepts for programming in SQL and VBA

-being specific about skills on my resume. I mentioned specific projects I worked on in school and in my own time but I wasn't too specific. It helps to give just enough detail to intrigue the person reading it. Then elaborate in the interview

-basic ratemaking book on the CAS website and other actuarial literature. The job I landed is in P&C and before my interview I read the majority of Werner and Modlin's book. At my interview I brought up the fact my daily fantasy sports spreadsheets used similar concepts to underwriting principles and using rating variables. The more you know about the job you're applying for, the more talking points you have to make a better impression

-if you don't already have some technical skills get some. Hopefully most people on here have used some sort of stats package or matlab or sql in college. Mention these on your resume. Again be specific but be able to elaborate. If you have no experience with anything there are so many online resources for Excel, Access, SQL, SAS has a free version, R is probably the most powerful open source tool for analysis with tons of free packages.

I was at a point where I thought I would never get a job. After 3 exams I wasn't getting any call backs. 3 months into my bank job I was getting call backs nearly every week. I still felt like I could never compete with students that have 3+ exams and internships and good grades. I believe now that if I can get in so can anyone else but it's definitely a lot of work. In college I was naive thinking I would have no trouble because I had a false sense of the size of the EL market and demand for jobs. I had a huge reality check over the past couple years but I persisted and now it's paying off. Better late than never, but I can't wait to finally begin my career, right before I turn 25.

I also want to thank this sub for critiquing my resume several times and for all the advice I read here on a daily basis

Advice to Land EL Position,4,2,False,False,False,actuary,1495326822,True,"Hey all! 

As I only have one more year of undergrad, I am looking at exploiting any and all ways to become more marketable in a somewhat saturated EL field.

I have very high Excel skills due to a relevant course at my university, and am looking into buying TIA's Technical Skills Course for even more learning over the summer.

When applying for internships for this summer (I did not end up landing one), I simply sent in applications online to all of the companies that I could find with open actuarial internships.

Dynamic Lapse Assumptions for Savings products,1,4,False,False,False,actuary,1495371186,True,"Hello there!

I'm trying to calibrate dynamic lapse assumptions for the projection of future cash flows of savings products. 
Basically, the dynamic lapse function would modify the base lapse rate depending on the diferential between the reference market rate (RMR) and the policy credited rate (CR), thus increasing lapses if the market rate is higher than the credited rate and reducing lapses if the market rate is lower than the credited rate.
It should look like this:

http://imgur.com/a/esIwf

The parameters that have to be estimated would be:

-First Trigger (value of RMR-CR) where the lapse rates start to increase

-Second Trigger (value of RMR-CR) where the lapse rates stop increasing and remain at the cap (maximum lapse value).

-Maximum lapse value

-First Trigger (value of RMR-CR) where the lapse rates start decreasing.

-Second Trigger (value of RMR-CR) where the lapse rates stop decreasing and remain at the cap (minimum lapse value).

-Minimum lapse value.

I believe that the idea behind the first triggers is that, small differences in lapses do not heavily affect lapse rates. Second triggers are in place because, after a certain gap between market rate and credited rate, lapses are no longer affected further.


I was wondering if there was any way to model these parameters or at least a function (maybe a GLM or an arctangent function) that could help identify these parameters, apart from relying on expert judment.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!


Edit: Forgot to mention, the data I currently have includes aggregated trimestral lapse rates for the last 10 years, reference market rate, and credited rate. policy data isn't available :(.

Where to purchase ASM FM manual?,3,0,False,False,False,actuary,1495393256,True,"I'm planning to take exam FM (my first exam) in August and was wondering where a good place to purchase the ASM manual is. Not sure if certain places have lower prices or anything. Also, how badly do I need the new 12th edition that's geared towards the re-formatted exam? What would be places to learn the new material if I end up with an older edition? Thanks in advance!"
Applying for jobs while still in school?,7,1,False,False,False,actuary,1495407987,True,"I'd like to start applying in my last semester, but most job listings require you to already be a graduate when applying. That seems rather late, and would probably waste a good few months.

New ASM MFE manuals suck?,18,7,False,False,False,actuary,1495413998,True,"I used the ACTEX manual for exam P, and I used the ASM manual for exam FM (along with a little bit of Adapt). I really liked both of these manuals. I ended with 9's on both of these exams so it's safe to say I understood the material quite well. With the 10th edition MFE manual, I feel like nothing is explained very well, especially the solutions to the practice questions. I am able to do the questions on Adapt, but I'm often unable to understand the questions from the manual, even after I look at the solutions. Also, I'm having difficulty understanding why so many of the questions aren't multiple choice. I'm considering switching to the Actex manual or getting infinite actuary. I'd like to hear some opinions on the Actex manual before I buy. Are the questions multiple choice? Is there adequate explanation of the topics?"

Just passed P! Advice for FM preparation?,2,5,False,False,False,actuary,1495421198,True,"I passed P today and am getting ready to begin preparing for FM.  

Background: To pass P, I studied from Finan's P guide and then purchased ADAPT to prepare for the exam.  Before ADAPT, I felt I knew the material but I didn't feel prepared for the exam and didn't pass the first time. I purchased ADAPT and took practice exams for a month and a half, and I ended up with an EL score of 9.3.  Passed quite readily today.

I have two main questions:

1. I felt that Finan prepared me for the concepts but not the exam. I have heard really good things about ASM, but I might not be able to afford ASM 12th AND ADAPT together.  Finan has updated his manual in March 2017 (presumably for the new syllabus).  I also have a copy of ASM 10th Edition. Either way, I am definitely purchasing an ADAPT subscription after studying.  Considering my views on preparation after Finan, and knowing the changes to the FM exam, which route would you suggest? I am confident that ADAPT can fill any knowledge gaps I might have after either choice.

2. I have read in this subreddit that the BA-II Plus/Professional is almost mandatory for FM.  I currently have the 30XS Multi, and I am completely comfortable with its functions. I understand that you can take multiple calculators into the exam. Would you recommend purchasing the BA-II to use for FM in addition to the 30XS? If so, which variation do you recommend?

Thanks in advance for all of your help and advice."

Advice on Networking for EL,8,38,False,False,False,actuary,1495616411,True,"I seem to see a lot of entry-level folks around here that ask for career advice on how to get started, and a large topic that always comes up is the topic of networking. I don't consider myself a networking expert by any means, but I do know that I was able to utilize my network very effectively early in my career all the way up to now, and I want to share some insights. Here I go:

**The end goal of networking is to build relationships, not to get a job**

I can't stress this part about effective networking any more. Far too many people view networking merely as a means to gain what it is that they want, while completely forgetting about the simple fact that networking is the art of meeting other real people, who are likely to just want a simple, professional **relationship**. Every professional can sniff out from a mile away by the wording of your e-mail if all you really care about is just getting a job, rather than being genuinely curious about the field and the work. People don't feel so fond when they know they are being used, and will respond much better if you demonstrate that you care for them, professionally, at least.

We all know that if you're sending those e-mails out, you probably want a job. That's a given. But try taking the approach of actually getting to know that person and the work and industry that they reside in, and *let that job referral be a byproduct of a successful networking relationship*, rather than the end goal. 

Perhaps you're not the best at creating conversation or you're a bit socially awkward. My best advice is, then, to *prepare* in advance what you are going to say and ask them. It's always a good thing if you can get them to talk about themselves a lot, then have them ask you questions about you, rather than you talking all the time. Some good sample questions to ask:

- How do you like working for company X, and can you compare it with your experience at other companies?
- What do you do in your day-to-day job? Can you describe to me in detail one project you worked on?
- What are some useful technical skills required for the job that you do?
- How did you get into your specific industry, and do you enjoy working in it? What are your opinions on the long-term prospects and job landscape of that field?

Ask good follow-up questions to their answers as well, especially when it comes to their day-to-day job. Show that you are critically thinking about what it is that they are saying. Don't be afraid to look dumb, it's way more important to show that you are curious, passionate, and willing to learn. 


**Always remember that every encounter with a working professional is an informal interview** 

Even if it's you're college bud or relative - treat them with respect and be adequately professional. Remember if they refer you and you turn out to be bad, it will reflect poorly on them. Do not approach a friend and ask them to ""hook you up"" with a job, unless you guys are seriously really close.

Some practical ways to network in this day and age, especially if you are recently graduated.

- Reach out to your social network - including friends, friends of friends, family, friends of family, etc. The profession ""actuary"" tends to be one of those that sticks out, and one that people remember even if they have one friend that does it. Be friends with other aspiring actuaries who don't have jobs, either. You never know if they'll be able to help you years down the road.
- Research all the companies hiring actuaries in your area - by the end of this, you should have a very strong grasp of which companies there are to work for, and which companies to target when you search and apply.
- Utilize LinkedIn. Brush up on your profile, and start connecting with some actuaries in your area. You can try to connect with random people, but the preferred method might be to reach out to your alumni at your university (type in your school name and ""actuarial"" or something in the search engine). Alumni are much more likely to help you than some random post-grad. If you can meet with them in person, that would be ideal, otherwise e-mail or phone call would work just fine.
- Look on the SOA directory for some e-mails to ask for advice and some time.
- If you are blindly applying to a company, try to find that company's HR recruiter on LinkedIn, get their e-mail, and e-mail your resume and application directly instead of going through their site.

In general, have a long-term view of your networking strategy. Even if a contact doesn't quite pan out in regards to getting you a referral, the simple fact that you are discussing the actuarial profession with someone who is in the field gives you a better understanding of the industry in general, and really will get you much more comfortable and confident come interview time. 


**Following up** 

It's good to keep in touch with people you feel you jived with from time to time. A good time to follow-up is a few months later when you pass your exam or when you get an interview. It gives an opportunity to catch up to see how they are doing and for you to potentially ask for some advice, or have some other questions you thought of in the meantime to answer. It's also nice if you're able to inquire about another company in the area, and perhaps ask them to refer you to their contact that works there.


**Things to know from the other side** 

- North of 90% of actuaries you contact will completely ignore you or reject you. Expect it and don't take it personal.
- A good number of introverted actuaries likely don't want anything to do with you, and may even find you annoying. Again, don't take it personal.
- Most people don't have time to read your long e-mails. Keep it short and sweet, trust me.
- Actuaries often get small referral bonuses if you get hired - this gives them an incentive to give you a shot if you're competitive at all.
- Other network savvy actuaries are always looking at you as a future investment. If you turn out to be good, 20 years down the road, you'll be in upper management at a competitor to which they'd be more than happy to cash in on their favor. The industry is very small, especially if you zoom in on a specific region, and actuaries know each other.
- You not only need to network, but you need to be lucky/patient enough for that specific company to have a specific EL opening for you at that very specific time. People may love to help you, but the company might not have any room on any of their teams for you.

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day, networking is a people skill. Some people are better than it at others, but I firmly believe it's something you can really work on, even if you'll never be awesome at it. It does involve you taking risks, putting yourself out there, selling yourself, being uncomfortable, and being vulnerable to lots and lots of rejection, but it can be very well worthwhile. Just be mindful of how you go about it, and when in doubt, be humble and curious. There's probably plenty of other ways you can network out there, but this was just the bulk of what I did. Good luck to all, and feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions!"

Career change advice,11,1,False,False,False,actuary,1495665092,True,"In 2011 I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics with a goal of becoming an actuary. I signed up to take Exam P and purchased manuals and an online video course. I began studying but when my Exam P test date arrived I knew I wasn't prepared to pass but I took it anyway. I failed the test but decided to sign up for the next test date. After studying for another month I lost interest and just quit studying. I failed Exam P again. 

At this point I went back to career in technical support and I've held a few positions since then. Lately, I've been thinking about a career change and I'm in a better place in my life where I can dedicate the time and have the motivation to study and pass exams.

This may be a hard question to answer without really knowing me but would you advise I start studying again for Exam P? I also thought I might try Exam FM first. 

Any advice or opinions are appreciated.

Relocation packages offered by consulting firms for EL positions?,29,3,False,False,False,actuary,1495995677,True,"Hey all!

**Strength:**
1. Good grade on paper (Exam 1-4 scored 9 or 10; pending result for 5 & S). Good GPAs. 
2. Strong technical background in VBA, R; experience with SQL, Python.  

**Weakness:**
1. no actuarial experience.
2. too many exams.
3. one year employment gap (due to many reasons: PhD application; SO; relocation constraints. I used the time to study for exams, some predictive modeling, and Python.)

**Background:**
I am a career changer who initially planned to pursue an academic career. I have pursued research, both in school and at work, that were centered around environmental and climate risk. I got interested in the industry of insurance early in my career (registered for exam P in 2013 but did not show up since I was pretty comfortable with my then job). I believed it is an industry where I can apply my modeling skills to social-business problems that add social value to the economy. Personally, I also enjoy being the technical person that my colleagues gravitate towards. 

My SO is a data scientist and we currently live in DC. We are planning to move to metropolitan areas where we can both find employment. 

I have some preference for property (re)insurance (incl. brokerage, consulting) due to some background in urban planning and real estate. I am also interested in CAT modeling as a stepping stone. But I am open to any analytical work in the industry. 

So the question is, as an actuary with hiring experience, will you give me an interview? Why or why not? I appreciate any feedback from redditors.

**tldr:** While I have made stupid decisions in my career planning, I have good technical skills and strong academic background. I am looking forward to hearing opinions from hirers' point of view. 

**update** 0601: Updated a newer version of resume. Thanks for people who reach out to me and give me concrete advices. Many thanks to redditors!"

Coaching Actuaries FM Question Help (Annuities),3,6,False,False,False,actuary,1496354218,True,"So I'm going through the FM Manual on Coaching Actuaries, and there's a problem I can't seem to get the right answer to. 

>In four years, Heidi wants to purchase a car. She plans to deposit X into an account at the end of every 3 months for 4 years, and then use the accumulated amount to pay for loan payments starting in exactly four years. Loan payments are $200 per month for 2 years. At the end of two years of making loan payments, her account balance is 0. Using an annual effective interest rate of 4%, calculate X.

The first thing I noticed was that the FV of the savings deposits had to be equal to the PV of the loan payments. 

I adjusted the interest rates per period accordingly (4% annual effective is 0.3274% monthly effective for the loan, and 0.9853% quarterly effective for the deposits) and then adjusted the number of periods for each payment (16 for the deposits and 24 for the loan.)

So then in the TVM I start with the loan since we know all of that info. I input: n=24, i/y= 0.3274, PMT=-200, FV=0 and compute PV to be 4609.012.

Moving to the deposits, I input n=16, i/y=0.9853, PV=0, FV=4609.012 and compute the payments to be 267.37.

However, the manual solution has 268.24, which is a difference of nearly a dollar. I'm confused as to where I went wrong.

Any advice for someone two and a half weeks before Exam C (learning from scratch)?,24,10,False,False,False,actuary,1496357785,True,"I had a personal situation where I couldn't fathom studying because I was extremely stressed. I finally got better and I started to study 2 days ago. I barely skimmed over ASM, skipping over every practice question. 

I bought ADAPT but I don't seem to have the basics down yet. Should I spent the last two and a half weeks focusing hard on ASM or should I just grind out ADAPT problems until I just memorize problems? I'm really scared I might fail this one since I had months to study for Exam P and Exam FM.

Thank you for any advice/comments in advance!

EDIT: Thank you for the witty responses! Thank you for all the responses actually, I do appreciate it. I know I screwed up and some of these comments made me chuckle, especially the 7th grade one XD It lifted a bit of the tension I was feeling. I think I'm at a point where I will try to not stress about the result but still try my best until it's over. Maybe I get lucky and I somehow pass! In case that happens, it might give a lot of students hope that they can still pass preliminary in 2 weeks from scratch even if they screwed up, and never give up. My current plan is that I'm going to be working on ADAPT section quizzes for 6 days while going over ASM (goal is 5 a day), take 2 ADAPT practice exams a day for a week, and finish off with as much of SOA 305 questions in the last 4 days, then take the exam on the 20th. Hopefully I can do it! I'll update in 2 weeks to see if this is possible :)

EDIT: Passed! I answered around 25-27ish questions with moderate confidence. The rest were iffy and I straight up guessed for 3 of them. I ran out of time because I spent the first hour panicking and answered like 5 questions. Thought I was going to fail for sure at that point. But I picked up the pace by doing the questions that seemed relatively easy first. I bought ADAPT for my two weeks of studying, and I used it soley for section quizzes after I read that topic on ASM manual. I finished simulation the day before the exam and ended up not doing any practice exams. Definitely do not recommed leaving it up to 2 weeks before exam time. I had a very miserable and depressing two weeks, although it payed off at the end. Good luck to everyone taking exams this sitting!"

Actuarial jobs that are less rote and detail-oriented?,7,3,False,False,False,actuary,1496456920,True,"3 years experience in health consulting, probably getting my FSA over the next year. Mostly work on Medicare (clients outsource this work to us, so I often feel my job should be called “actuarial outsourcing services” rather than “actuarial consulting services”).

Out of actuaries (and yes, I consider this a rather particular subset of the population), I am definitely not a ""dot the i's and cross the t's"" kind of person. Compared to other credentialed actuaries, I have worse natural detail orientation - no way around it. On the other hand, I believe I am better than most actuaries at seeing the big picture of the business and understanding 'why' things work the way they do. On Myers-Briggs, I'm INTJ.

So here’s my question… Are there actuarial roles with the following?:

- Relatively less detail-oriented type of work
- More of a focus on high-level results, product, and strategy
- More emphasis on analyzing data and business operations, rather than just doing a rote outsourced task
- More leeway in developing an approach to solve a problem, as opposed to having a process already very strictly assigned
- More of a “design the system” than a “check the boxes” type of job
- Ability to write SAS/VBA code to build tools and analyses, rather than simply recycling/updating code somebody else wrote

Thanks in advance for any input. As a final note, I would absolutely be willing to take less money for more job satisfaction.

"Taking jobs as a ""stepping stone""",14,3,False,False,False,actuary,1496940225,True,"I'm sure this sub knows that EL actuarial roles can be few and far between- this leads to people considering and taking relevant jobs in hopes to build enough experience to be a better candidate for an actuarial position.
 

This is where I am now- I've graduated almost 2 years ago (so I'm pushing the definition of a 'recent grad'), been at and excel in my current job in finance/ERM for about 1.5 years, have 3 exams passed, and no bites on an actuarial job. So I've been considering looking for *yet another* 'stepping stone' job (such as an underwriter or data scientist) in hopes to work up from within, since working outside of the insurance world seems to be a hindrance.

Advice/ Opinions,7,0,False,False,False,actuary,1496992543,True,"Hey. I'm a Long Islander currently in the summer between my Sophomore and Junior years of a New York State college (Stony Brook, for the curious). I am an Applied Mathematics and Economics double major with a 3.6 GPA and have just recently gotten into the idea of being an actuary and would like some advice/ opinions. Currently, I do not have any exams passed and do not have any internships. I have taken calculus based probability classes and calculus up to and including multi-variable.  If I started studying for exams now, is it 1) Likely/possible for me to get a summer internship for the summer leading into my Senior year and 2) Likely/possible for me to get an entry level position by the time I graduate.

For example, if I take an exam with a difficulty level of 6, how many questions do I need to get correct in order to have my EL jump up to 6? 25 (out of 35)?  

How about if I take an exam of difficulty level 3?  Would I need to be almost perfect on it, getting 32 or so correct?

Thoughts on becoming an actuary,15,0,False,False,False,actuary,1497120070,True,"Hello, I need some advice on if becoming an actuary would become a pipe dream, or if it is something that could still be attainable.

I am 29, and I have a BA. During my undergrad I never had to take a math class, and the only math that I have is high school level.

I have never taken Calculus, or statistics or anything like that. I enjoy math, but don't believe that my current level of math would be enough to even consider becoming an actuary.

I am married, but have no kids, and have a full time job servicing annuities and also dealing with death claims. I also have other responsibilities that take probably around another 8 hours of my time a week.

I have come to enjoy annuities and only recently learned about the actuary profession.

Any advice at all is welcome, from how long it would take to if it's still a viable option, or if I would need to get another degree, etc.

I appreciate any and all help, guidance, and responses.

Thank you!"

* Go to your ""[my exam](https://netforum.casact.org/eWeb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=Exams)"" page. 
* Under the ""Official Grade"" table, the ""Current Exam Credits"" column seems to be updated to reflect if you passed exams in Spring 2017 (exam 7 is missing in action for everyone right now).
* Right click on the ""Print"" button, and say ""Copy Link Address"".
* Paste the link into your address bar, and edit the following:
  * ""sittingcode = 2016/10"" changes to ""sittingcode = 2017/05""
  * ""&cexid=5"" changes to ""&cexid=6U"" (these values are different depending on your previous/current exam).
* This link should open your ""Official Grade Report"" with your numeric score.

Edit: I think they caught on....the page now shows ""Our records indicate that no grade report is currently available...""

**New Method**

* The URL looks something like this: https://netforum.casact.org/eWeb/Reports/ReportStart.aspx?ReportKey=0cbe6932-96ee-439f-b1f1-35cde5076386&Key=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE&sittingcode=2017/05&cst_key=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE&cexid=YOUR_EXAM_NUMBER_HERE
* Replace YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE with your ""remote key"" on the main page of your [CAS profile](http://community.casact.org/p/us/sn/req=ext).
* Replace YOUR_EXAM_NUMBER_HERE with the exam you are interested in (normally just a number, but it is a bit different for 6 because of the two versions).
* That should generate your grade report."
Other quantitative professions,4,9,False,False,False,actuary,1497796613,True,"I'm trying to branch out a little and find some other fields where you need a strong mathematics and computer background for business. One of the advantages of actuarial science is its specificity. ""Actuary"" means something very specific and outlines a fairly clear series of steps to making a career. Other things I'm aware of, analyst, data science, quantitative finance, all seem highly unspecific. I really don't have a good idea what any of those jobs really are. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with other specific jobs that someone interested in actuarial science could be good at."
Cyber risk model - production model in pricing/RM,0,3,False,False,False,actuary,1497799695,True,"I am trying to find some resources on how to model cyber risk. I found one SOA ""cybersecurity insurance"" report, one slide from Aon, that are helpful. But I am still unclear about the modeling process in practice. Esp.
1. How do you model correlated risks? (Copulas?)
2. What model fits best? Do you apply extreme vale theory (fit a generalized Pareto distribution)?
3. Do you model loss by ""attack type""?
4. How does the parameter estimated via a GLM get used in simulation model to price the risk? Do you use simulation model at all?

Does anyone have experience with such model in pricing or risk management?"
Arcones slide equivalent for exam p?,3,1,False,False,False,actuary,1497809847,True,"Hey all! I recently passed fm and now I've been looking to get a head start on exam p, which I'm hoping to take in January.  For fm, I used the arcones slides as my main study guide to learn the material.  Is there something equivalent to these for exam p?"
Immunization question (for exam fm),6,1,False,False,False,actuary,1497810533,True,"I would post this on Act Outpost, but my registration still hasn't been approved there.

Anyway:  I think i'm confusing myself with these immunization problems.  

What interest rate are we supposed to use for the problems?  The interest rate on the assets, liabilities, or market rate?

For example, let's say a question goes as follows:

Liability: $200 at time 3 (a loan taken out at 20%)

Assets: A at time 2 and B at time 4

Market Rates: 5%

Find A and B.

So, we find A and B using the market rate (5%) in our calculations correct?

We find A to be $95.24 and B is $105.  Because these two amounts will equal $200 at time 3 at 5%.

So, the rate that the liability was taken out at (20%) and the rate that the assets were bought at (1%) are irrelevant here correct? "
asking for suggestions - entry level job in Canada?,2,1,False,False,False,actuary,1497813505,True,"Hi everyone, 

Would it be almost impossible for someone without a math/actuarial science BSc degree (I have PhD in a non-statistical field, but guess is irrelevant here), but with a few exams passed (let's say 2-3) to land an entry-level job in Canada? How much would getting a Masters in statistical science/actuarial science in a Canadian university helps?

Also, how about the same questions for the States?

How long does it take to understand general probability?,7,2,False,False,False,actuary,1497830561,True,"I passed FM about a week ago, and jumped right into P hoping to pass it by September. 

I've put about 20 hours into P, and I am definitely struggling with general probability already. It seemed like I was making much quicker progress with FM. 

How long does it take to understand general probability, and does the rest of the material build on general probability? I'm worried I'm spending too much time on these first few sections, but I don't want to rush through it, and ultimately struggle with all sections. 

To be honest, I had a lot of confidence when I cracked open the manual after my FM pass. Unfortunately, that's already gone away after getting destroyed by chapter one of P. I appreciate any advice/comments. "

Recently, there have been signs of improvement."" on beanactuary. So I still see projections of growth at a higher than average job growth percentage and want to know if anyone actually in the field can tell me what they think.

Btw, I am becoming a senior at Rutgers University with an actuarial degree, Exam P passed and taking Fm in August. I should have all my VEE's finished by the time I graduate as well as 2 courses, Life Contingencies 1 & 2, no internships, and I will be learning C++ by this fall."

I am just now starting to study for FM (taking before P). If all goes well, I hope to have both P and FM completed by 1Q of 2018. My question is-which should I take after these two? I'm hoping to complete 3 before the July 2018 changes.

I'm guessing MFE would seem to make more sense to take 3rd, since it sounds like SOA/CAS will only have 3 prelims in common now after the changes. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! "

MFE exchange options,4,2,False,False,False,actuary,1497904323,True,"I'm having trouble with the wording of the text and MFE exams. In an exchange option example, given the wording ""Calculate the price of an option to exchange 10 of S for 20 shares of Q"", which stock do you receive and which do you trade in? 
In basic English, exchanging A for B means you receive B and ""pay"" with A (according to a quick google search). However, I found in my ACTEX study manual, it says that you ""obtain 10 units in exchange for 20 unites of Q"".
These sound like contradicting rules as far as I can tell. Since the interpretation determines the whole pricing of the exchange option, what am I supposed to follow? "

Yield Quesrions,4,4,False,False,False,actuary,1497918837,True,"Hey everyone. I just failed FM, for the second time, today after studying my ass off for weeks and my problem seems to be in regards to calculating yields. I had about 7 questions that dealt with finding the yield of some pay stream.

For bonds, yield seems to be

(Face Value * annual coupon rate) / Price

from what I can tell, but how do I find the yield of something that isn't a bond? For example:

A lender is receiving level monthly payments at the end of each month for 10 years on a loan of 1000. The interest rate is 7%. Upon receiving each payment, he invests the money into an account paying a nominal interest of 8% convertible monthly. What is the yield?

It seems like I'd start by converting 7 into a monthly rate to figure out the monthly payments received for 120 months. Once I find that, I can find out how much he makes using an annuity due. How do I find the yield from that?

Thank you"
Quantitative Finance For EL?,2,1,False,False,False,actuary,1497921748,True,"So as I've been studying for my 3rd act exam and applying for EL jobs, I've found that some of the topics covered on MFE have intersection with topics encountered in the field of quant finance. I've tried my hand at implementing some of the commonly used models in VBA and MATLAB, and I find the underlying mathematics behind them to be really interesting. 

Is it feasible to land a quant position with some exams and maybe a portfolio of projects I've worked on? (along with a well-organized resume and strong cover letter of course) Applying the concepts I've learned to a programming language has really helped to nail them down, like delta-hedging and monte carlo sims, so I honestly think that regardless of whether it'll provide me with job prospects or not, I'll probably continue to apply it just for general understanding, and for fun because I strangely find it quite enjoyable"

Currently, I work in life insurance company, but just get an offer from recruiter about Life Reinsurance Broking Actuary at one company.

It would be very appreciated if anyone can share me the information or idea about this role. Is it completely different track from corporate actuary? or anything you would like to add for someone with no idea about would be very kind.

"Interviewing for non-actuarial job, but at an insurance company.",9,2,False,False,False,actuary,1498006257,True,"So, looking for a little advice here. I've been contacted about a data analyst position at an insurance company, and considering the run of luck I've had trying to find a job that will provide relevant experience, I'm pretty desperate to get this job. It employs a lot of skills that cross over into typical actuarial job requirements.

So here's what I'm worried about. This insurance company contacted me about the position, inviting me to apply, *because I previously applied to an actuarial position with them*. (Read: they are already aware that I'm looking to become an actuary, obviously, because that's the only reason they know I exist.)

Typically, I leave anything about wanting to be an actuary or sitting for exams off of my resume when applying to nonactuarial jobs because I don't want employers to think that I'm going to jet the instant an actuarial job comes my way. With these guys, that cat's already out of the bag.

So, how would any of you handle this topic in a job interview? Because I know for a fact that they are going to ask me about my career goals and whether I'll be satisfied in a role that isn't as an actuary. I don't want to lie and say that I'm happy to abandon my goals and settle for a different career path, but I also think that it would be a very good thing for me if I could get my foot in a door somewhere like this.

Career guidance needed - Any advice appreciated,16,9,False,False,False,actuary,1498311629,True,"Hi /r/Actuary

Little bit about me: I graduated in December with my degree in Finance, and passed Exams P/FM/MFE in Sept-16, Dec-16, Mar-17 respectively. I have a 3.3 overall GPA and a 3.8 major GPA. No internship experience. Currently doing data manipulation/entry work.

Currently I have 3 potential job offers and I'm not sure how to handle this

1) Financial Analyst position at small fuel wholesaler doing mainly trend analysis and data visualization. This position is nearly a sure thing, and probably pays between $55,000 to $65,000.

Pros: Great company (currently work there). Manager is great, the work seems interesting, and its right down the street from me. Work also seems to be mostly financial data analysis, with minimal accounting. Amazing work environment and they love me there. They'll probably let me do statistical analysis on our data (no one else is doing it), and this position could be very relevant to actuarial work. Lastly, I've been working there 4 months already so if I were to take this position my resume would read Financial Analyst (03/2017 to Present), it would appear as if I had more experience than I really do, which could be beneficial in getting interviews.

Cons: Not in an insurance company.

2) Temp to hire for a Fortune 50 insurance company doing mainly analysis work but my job title would be ""intermediate accountant"". Apparently the pay is only ~$42,000 a year and the work is probably less relevant to actuarial work when compared to option 1.

Pros: Huge and reputable insurance company, who houses a large actuarial team in the very same office I would be working in. Also the hiring manager knows I have done 3 actuarial exams and currently studying for 4th, yet still wants to interview me. I would probably be able to transfer internally (who knows how long though). As far as I know I'm the only one interviewing for this position.

Cons: Pay is significantly lower than option 1. Work is most likely less relevant and interesting than option 1. Work environment won't be as nice as option 1. Temp to hire, so there is no guarantee I would have the job at the end of the contract, but I would be able to put Company XYZ on my resume.

3) Internship to hire position as an actuarial intern. This is a no brainer, if offered I would take it even if its risky. This would give me 3 (hopefully 4 exams) by the end of the internship, and also relevant experience. Even if I wasn't offered a job at the end, I feel my next job would be significantly easier to find due to the internship (I have no other internship experience). Fantastic company as well.

Cons: Risky since its on the other side of the country.

So my questions is: Considering these options (really only option 1 or 2 since if 3 was offered I would take it), what job would set me up best for a career as an actuary?

I'm pretty lost as to what I should do, so any advice will be highly appreciated."

Coaching Actuaries New MLC Manual and Video Lessons,1,15,False,False,False,actuary,1498357921,True,"Greetings!

We are now offering a free trial of our MLC manual, as well as a free trial of our video lessons. The video lessons are instructed by Coach Kester. No credit card is required. 

If you are interested in a free trial of the manual, go to https://www.coachingactuaries.com/MLC/CAManual and click on ""Free Trial"" at the bottom of the page.

If you are interested in a free trial of the videos, go to https://www.coachingactuaries.com/MLC/Video-Lessons and click on ""Free Video Trial"".

Our goal is to help students to study for MLC efficiently. The new manual is created so that it teaches the concepts concisely and then illustrates how to apply them with examples. Then, to practice, we encourage our students to do quizzes in Adapt. Because Adapt has a large pool of questions, we believe our students should use Adapt to practice directly, and hence we do not have practice problems in our manual.

From our experience, many students spend too much time reading a text or a manual relative to practicing. We want to help students to stay exam-focused and invest more time in practicing rather than reading, as we believe practicing promotes active learning, and is the best way to prepare for the exam.

If you have any questions, please contact us at support@coachingactuaries.com."

But since this past sitting for C was the first one I have done all year, I will likely be required to take another exam his year. 

It took me from early January to mid-June to get to the point with the Exam C material where I could pass the exam. This was with using the ASM and ADAPT practice exams. 

I am willing to put in whatever amount of time is needed, but do you think it is possible for me to pass Exam S in such a short span of time given that July is just around the corner and the sitting is in October? I do not want to take the exam unless I have a realistic chance of passing. I'll try to do an online course or something instead.

Stat Reserve vs Tax Reserve?,5,8,False,False,False,actuary,1498597888,True,"What's the difference between Stat Reserve and Tax Reserve?

From what I know, they currently equal under CRVM, but under PBR, that may or may not be the case. (On the Life side)

My understanding...

* A **reserve** is a pool of money that the insurer sets aside to pay future expected claims. An insurer may not report all premiums as income because some of that must be set aside for reserves.
* **Statutory reserve** is the amount of reserves required by law.

My conjecture...

* **Tax Reserves** reflect the premiums held as reserves and not reported as income for fair taxation.

If this is the case, then why would Tax reserves not equal Stat reserves under PBR?"

https://bcgts.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/actc2016-3.pdf
So, there are many confusions pls bear with me.

(1) In example 2.7f it says :-
Show that a constant rate of simple interest implies a declining effective rate of interest.
and then he does( 1+ni - (1+(n-1)i))/1+(n-1)i and that this depends on n. Isnt this the same as changing focal points affect the simple interest calculation and you can only look from one focal point( because the interest doesnt get compounded unlike in compound interest where for any n , the rate of interest between 0th and nth vs (n-1)th and nth is the same? my question is . why is it called effective rate? 

(2) he says that the effective annual interest rate is
""effective annual rate of interest is defined to be the rate which would produce the same amount of interest per year;""
1+i = (1+i(nominal)/m)^m .where m is the number of times the nominal interest rate is compounded in a year.
Now, does this mean i is a simple interest rate or a compound interest rate? it could be both right ? why not? 

(3) in example 2.8b what does a equivalent effective daily interest rate even mean? does it mean ""that rate which would produce the same amount of interest per day "" 
well if thats the case then why do we need to have 91 days in the 2.8b(a) where its simple interest for 6% per annum.
Shouldnt i do like, in one day it would give (1+(0.06/365))=1+i 
the logic being :- in 1 year the simple interest gained will be 0.06 times the amount invested so in 1 day it will be 0.06/365 ?
2.8b(b) and 2.8b(c) are intuitive using this logic. However i only get confused when theres a lot of simple interest in the mix.

How many exams to take for EL?,2,0,False,False,False,actuary,1498773349,True,"Hi fellow actuaries. I'm a student almost in my last year in college, and am wondering how many exams could be ideal for someone who is starting out as an actuary. Typically I hear anywhere from just one to 4-5 exams and all VEE's for a full-time EL offer, which isn't too helpful

I think the issue for a lot of my colleagues going into this field is that we're worried about either not making the job (due to not having enough exams or experience) or being priced out for having too many

Overall I'm planning to end this summer with internship experience and 3 exams passed. I also figured that it's possible to go for a 5 prelim/3 VEE package before graduating if I study a little in my senior year, but I'm worried that by doing so, I might be screwed when it's time to get a job. On a similar note, however, I know several actuaries who couldn't get an offer with GPA's way higher than mine and a ton of exams

"CAS S, 5, or modules and VEEs?",16,5,False,False,False,actuary,1498779125,True,"I just passed Exam C, but per my employer's rules, I must take one more exam this year. I was going to just take S, but for the following reasons, I'm not sure this is a good idea:
* S is only offered one more time
* S has been unpredictable on nearly every sitting
* The study materials for S are inadequate at best

Because of this, I am considering skipping to 5 or just knocking out all the VEEs and both the online courses (I did not major in actuarial science in college). 

I would have to take either 5 or S in October or finish all the VEE/module stuff by the end of the year. My employer gives bigger raises for passing on the first attempt than they do for later ones, so not failing is important to me, but not necessarily to the exclusion of everything else. Most importantly, I know I need to choose one and get to studying.

Should I bother with taking Calc 2 in College?,7,3,False,False,False,actuary,1499305954,True,"So recently the AP scores were released and I got a 4 on the calc BC test.

Currently I am enrolled in Calc 2 for the fall semester, but I can change that come August granted there's an open Calc 3 class. 

I've heard that calc 2 isn't super essential to taking calc 3 and that the whole calculus sequence in general isn't super needed for Actuaries. Due to those reasons, I am inclined to believe that I should switch into Calc 3, but I wanted to confer with you guys first. "
What would my path to becoming an actuary look like?,20,0,False,False,False,actuary,1499306117,True,"Hey guys, how's it going. I'm a rising senior at Northwestern University, and for the most part I still have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm majoring in economics and minoring in transportation & logistics, and I have an internship this summer as an equity research analyst for an asset management company.

I've decided that I don't really like what I'm doing this summer, and I've taken a couple quick looks at actuarial sciences before but never really dove into it. I guess my first question is: would I like being an actuary? I have a pretty logical and analytical mind, but I like being creative as well. I can handle some monotonous stuff, but nothing too unbearable. On the other hand, I don't really like when problems are too open ended to solve in a systematic way. 

I think I might have the potential to really like this career (I also actually kind of enjoy studying for/taking tests!). As a result of that, I would also like to know what my path would look like. 

I've taken multivariable derivative and integral calculus, an introduction to econometrics, and one linear algebra class. I have some space in my schedule senior year, so what other classes should I take if I want to prepare to be an actuary?

Also, when should I start studying for these exams? Would it be smart to try and do them senior year of college?

And finally, how do I go about finding an entry level position as an actuary? What are the best places to look, and is it even possible to get an entry level actuary position before I've taken the exams?

This was kind of convoluted, but I would appreciate any and all help you can offer. Thank you guys so much for whatever you can offer me, I'm sure to be refreshing this thread often :)"

[ASM] Help Understanding Risk Neutral Probabilities Analogy,2,3,False,False,False,actuary,1499530770,True,"http://imgur.com/a/41yv5

I have read this over several times but it still doesn't make sense to me.  Here's how the situation plays in my head.

An American start with $1.

A Brit start with 1 pound.

Exchange rate starts 1:1.

Expected exchange rate = $1.25 / 1 pound.

From the American's perspective, if they trade their $1 for 1 pound at time zero and waits until time T they will have 1 pound = $1.25 dollars.  This means that they should invest in pounds today.

From the Brit's perspective, if they trade their 1 pound for $1 today, then they should only expect to have 1/1.25 pounds at time T.

"How Investment Fund Managers Set Investment Year Rates (Re Portfolio Method vs Investment Year Method, FM)",4,1,False,False,False,actuary,1499724285,True,"I apologize in advance if this is out of place. I know we have an exams question thread but the scope of the question seemed somewhat beyond what is covered in the exam material.


I am using [Finan's Text](http://faculty.atu.edu/mfinan/actuarieshall/mainf.pdf) to study for FM. Mathematically, I am having no trouble doing the calculations regarding Investment Year Method returns, but I still don't understand exactly how the Investment Year method works or what problem it is intended to remedy. 


Let me explain how I *thought* an investment fund worked: a group of investors deposit money with a fund manager who uses the collective deposits to make investment decisions. The return rate of the entire fund is credited to the individual investors' accounts at the rate of return achieved by the fund manager less management fees.


Indeed, this seems to be *exactly* how the portfolio method works. 


As for the investment year method, I understand that accounts are credited at different rates of return depending on the date of deposit.


What I don't understand is how these rates are set. Here are my questions:


Are these rates set at the time of deposit or at the beginning of some  period? If so, how can the fund manager possibly guarantee a rate of return not knowing ahead of time what his rate of return will be? 


Are the rates instead set retroactively at the end of some period (ie, the fund actually yielded x% on all deposited funds but your account is being credited at y%?)? How are these rates set? What problem with the portfolio method are they attempting to address by using the Investment Year Method?

Do I have some sort of fundamental misunderstanding or am I somehow otherwise missing the point?

Cyber Insurance,4,3,False,False,False,actuary,1500387002,True,"I've been in the IT security management and technical ops space for ten or so years now and continue to find myself producing elaborate spreadsheets to assist with my work.

Resume Question,3,0,False,False,False,actuary,1500411048,True,"I'm a mathematics and economics double major. Currently, my economics GPA looks like it will be a 3.74 but I'm doing poorly in some of my proof writing classes, which may drop my mathematics GPA down to a 3.25 - 3.42 range (from a 3.77).

Is it even worth having the mathematics major on my resume if the major GPA is a 3.25? My concern is they may think I am poor at math, but it's really just the proof writing that I have been struggling with.

EDIT:

My cumulative is okay but not great (3.46).The economics major GPA is high and I took graduate level courses (I have the course equivalent to a master's in econ). I'm proud of it and am curious if that would make me stand out at all.

I forgot to mention that I have a Spanish degree from a few years ago that's a 3.86. I know it's not relevant, but I'm hoping it signals that I'm capable of learning more than one type of thing and can be flexible and that I have good communication skills."

They sent their revised copy back to me today, but I'm not sure if it's up to the proper standards. It looks fairly cluttered to my eyes. I'm also doubtful that my high school needs to be included.

I have attached both resumes (personal information redacted). The original is Resume1 and the edit is Resume2. Resume2 has not been changed from the copy I received from my friend. There are areas in Resume 2 that I still need to fill in, but I would like to know if it actually usable first. 

My question is this: Which format looks more professional and is more likely to attract positive attention when I am applying? Should I use neither format and go with something else entirely?

I would also greatly appreciate any further advice on improving my resume, regardless of which format I choose. Thank you so much to all of you.

"[FM] [Finan, Problem 19.17] Need help on an annuity problem",2,1,False,False,False,actuary,1500961784,True,"Problem 19.17 from Finan's text reads:
> On the first day of every January, April, July, and October, Smith deposits 100 in an account earning *i*^\(4\) = 0.16. He continues the deposits until he accumulates a sufficient balance to begin withdrawals of 200 every 3 months starting three months after the final deposit such that he can make twice as many withdrawals as he made deposits. How many deposits are needed.

The back of the book says the answer is 26.

---
Here are two different attempts I made:

**1) Equate future value of annuity-due to present value of annuity-immediate.**

100(1.04)s*_n_* = 200a*_2n_*

(1.04)(1.04^n - 1)/.04 = 2(1 - 1.04^-2n )/.04

I don't know how to solve that algebraically, so I used WolframAlpha to get n=24.8388. Which would imply an answer of 25 (i.e. 24 deposits isn't enough for 48 withdrawals, but 25 is enough for 50).
        

**2) Equate future value of annuity-immediate to present value of annuity-immediate.**

100s*_n_* = 200a*_2n_*

(1.04^n - 1)/.04 = 2(1 - 1.04^-2n )/.04

Let x = 1.04^n

x - 1 = 2(1 - x^-2 )

x^3 - x^2 = 2x^2 - 2

0 = x^3 -3x^2 + 2 = (x-1)(x^2 - 2x - 2) [using Rational Roots Theorem]

x can't equal 1, so using quadratic formula, we get x = 1 + \sqrt(3) = 1.04^n , which yields n = 25.63. This implies that at least 26 deposits are needed to be able to make double the amount of withdrawals.

----
So am I right in assuming that there was a typo in the question and it should've read ""on the **last** day of every..."" so that approach 2 would be valid and yield the answer of 26 given in the back of the book?"

I just started to minor in Actuarial Mathematics last semester, mainly because I thought it would enable me to get better jobs later. I am starting to dig into this actuary profession and it would be nice if anyone can give me more insights about being an actuary.

How is life as an actuary and what do you usually do in your job? What skills should I get before graduating if I want to become an actuary? Where should I start to look to pursue a career in actuary? When do people usually take their actuarial exams?

Thanks in advance!"

VEE credit question,1,1,False,False,False,actuary,1501014222,True,"Hi all,

After browsing the stickied post and the SOA website, I am still very confused about the curriculum changes and VEE credits. Primarily, I am concerned with applied statistics. I am graduating next semester and am not sure if it's worth my time to move around my entire schedule to take an approved applied stats course. The website says, ""Candidates who do not earn this credit prior to July 1, 2018 must pass the Statistics for Risk Modeling Exam and unless they have passed Exam C by July 1, 2018 will also be required to complete the VEE Mathematical Statistics requirement.""

I guess my question is- if I manage to take applied stats next semester, will it still count for VEE credit? Will I still have to take an additional exam? Or a new VEE course? Also I don't have time to pass exam C before July, so how does this affect my pathway to ASA?

I also know you need to take two exams prior to earning VEE credits. I have so far only passed P with plans to pass FM before the end of 2017.

Any insight would be hugely helpful, as I would have to make sacrifices in my course load to account for this VEE."

Thinking this is for me...,11,0,False,False,False,actuary,1501080968,True,"So I didn't realize I lived math until my last year of college. Now I'm 24 and am expecting to get my passing CFA level 3 results in a week or two. 

I work in insurance and have some great connections (amazing honestly, I just transferred but my previous boss is a household name for anyone in the industry and we are keeping in touch. I was super lucky.) but I I am currently in client servicing/sales. 

I don't like my current position - it is insanely stressful and in my opinion leads to someone my age getting treated like an unskilled, low value employee. I had a talk with someone else my age in the company and we agreed that our company's strategy is designed around people like us getting fed up and quitting before a raise. I know my career is my responsibility and I really think the actuarial side is for me.

Would going the FSA route be a nice complement? The internet is telling me no, but I am already in the industry and have the CFA. Here is what I am looking for:

1. Math related work

2. A strong mathematics curriculum. I am self teaching so I want to be able to tell myself I have a strong understanding of the subject if I pass the test on it. 

3. The ability to somehow incorporate my CFA. This is what got me thinking about the FSA.

My only real hobby is Machine Learning courses and coding...I think actuarial work would really help that hobby along, no? I know applying it is a different story due to regulations, but the math base is really hard to come by outside of higher education."

I've been working in pension consulting since graduating college. Since I've started working, the amount of technical work has decreased significantly. A lot of day-to-day work is just project management and possibly answering client questions. I feel like I'm not being trained as an actuary anymore, which also makes it harder to study for exams since I feel like I won't need my ASA to do my current job anyway. The EA right now seems like it will be impossible to study for because I'm not really reviewing the technical reports anyway so the detailed material will be rather new versus review. I recognize these are rather vague feelings so I can clarify as needed!

Are there any fellow redditors who have entered the pension space recently and stayed, and can you elaborate what makes me you fulfilled at the end of the day? I'm also open to any redditors who left the pension industry (or shifted gears perhaps) to keep their actuarial skills growing!

Career switch from accounting,6,4,False,False,False,actuary,1501112013,True,"So I've been in the workforce a few years and starting to get the feeling the career path I am on is not for me.

Little background:
Just finished up my third year of working. Two years in big 4 public accounting in a major metro and one year in internal audit.

When I went into accounting I realized I enjoyed working more with numbers and financial ratios/planning etc. and auditing is obviously not scratching that itch.

I've looking into FP&A roles and others related to more financial modeling. I've come across reading more and more about the actuarial profession and it seems interesting (though quite math intensive).

Before I go too far down this route, is it worth looking into the exams and getting a feel for if this route is right for me? I was also wondering if it makes sense to go back and get a masters in mathematics or something similar.

Credentials
BS in Business Admin (3.2 GPA) - Took calc 1 + 2 and advanced stats.
MBA in Accounting (3.4 GPA)
CPA

I feel that I may need to strengthen my math skills based on what I've read but otherwise would passing 2-3 exams make me a good candidate for an entry level position?

"Disability Question: can ""Any-Occupation"" be better than ""Own-Occupation"" and they still receive a benefit?",13,1,False,False,False,actuary,1501129427,True,"I'm going to use an example from [The Rookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie_of_the_Year_(film\)).

He ends up pitching for a major league baseball team, but he has difficulties doing normal tasks. 

I have a question about the film that I'm sure most people walked away with: what sort of disability benefits would Henry receive if he were covered under a plan (**Edit: This part especially was sarcasm /s /s /s**). Assume a 2-year own-occ provision, then any-occ after.

All he's able to do is throw a baseball really fast (any-occ), but it's extremely hard for him to do his homework (own-occ). Since he can't do his own-occ as a result of an injury/disability, is he then not allowed to receive any compensation for working during the two year own-occ stage if he wants his benefits? Since in this case, his any-occ is better than his own-occ. Do they deny him compensation and risk having him get back on disability (which sorta happens in the movie)? Or are there provisions that say ""you can work any occupations in the own-occ stage, but the benefit will be reduced for each $X you make at your any-occ job""?

Capstone Certificate Program,16,1,False,False,False,actuary,1501172604,True,"Hello All,

I have been interested in becoming an actuary for a little while now, even to the point of starting to study for exam P. I have a BS in Econ from a B1G school and still live in the area. The school offers a capstone certificate program in actuarial sciences for those without an undergrad degree in the field. Currently, I work as an accounting analyst and I would start the program full time in the spring.

My thought process is since I can afford the program, it will be beneficial in terms of resources for exams and networking to get started in the actuarial field. Plus i would have next summer open for an internship.

Based on this, does the program seem worthy of the cost? By that I mean, would I be just as well of if I forego the certificate and study on my own? Let me know, thanks everyone!"

UK Graduate - deciding between Capital/Pricing role in the Lloyd's Market?,4,2,False,False,False,actuary,1501334669,True,"In the very fortunate position to be offered two graduate roles at two syndicates:

Syndicate A:

- Pricing role, relatively small syndicate. Pricing team is very small but has two guys who seems to have a ton of purely pricing experience

- Opportunity to do capital/reserving projects in the future if wanted to

Syndicate B:

- Has a slightly bigger name (if that matters at all). The role is in capital, using ReMetrica. Fairly large actuarial team.

I am not sure which to go for. I'm a fairly technical person (really into programming and stats) which is leading me towards the pricing role. I had a 3 month internship in pricing and it was really great but it was at a really technical place. Syndicate A seems like it would be a much more pricing actuaries sitting with underwriters role which to be honest is not bad at all but I am not the most ""outgoing"" person, I am definitely fairly nerdy at heart I would say. I do enjoy talking to a ton of people and I think it would be good for me to do more of it - but I am not sure if it is a ""natural"" fit for me per say? I have a ton of experience tutoring, and my communication quite good I would say but I am definitely not the type of person who would jump into a conversation which I had no interest in.

Syndicate B seems OK - I wasn't a big fan of the interview process/people if I'm honest. But it's in Capital, and I am not sure if that's much more a fit for me. I think technical pricing would definitely be for me as it seems a bit more dynamic.

Questions:

- Future outlook for capital/pricing actuaries? Are some more in demand than others? 

- I read a few things (from this subreddit) that pricing actuaries, especially in the lloyd's market are pretty much only contained to the lloyd's market. Not that I have an intention to move, but it's just good to know

- My ideal role would be pricing I would think, but I have spoken to a qualified actuary (in reserving/capital I think) who says that pricing actuaries are really outgoing and in your face, and I wouldn't describe myself as that. I'm pretty good technically and can speak well and influence people/backup my points but I am not the type who would be out most nights.

Any advice/thoughts would be brilliant."

Looking to try to land an internship for next summer. Wondering if it's possible to teach myself a relevant programming language.,9,3,False,False,False,actuary,1501566554,True,"Greetings, /r/actuary. Been browsing here for awhile, now posting for the first time. Let me explain my situation.

I will be a junior this coming fall, and I'm aware that come late-September, I'll need to start shooting out as many applications as I can to even have a chance. I go to a small university on the west coast (major disadvantage in this field, I know) but I have a ~3.92 GPA and currently have one exam passed (Exam P in May). I'm currently studying the ASM Manual for Exam FM, which I will take in two weeks. I'll be brutally honest, I'm pessimistic and feel like my chances of passing are a coin flip at best, but who knows.

I've also worked a part-time (20-40 hours/week) summer job last year and this year (work as a lego engineering camp assistant for children), am currently the sports section editor for my campus newspaper (a lot of communication, obviously, so I feel its relevant) and I grade Calculus/Statistics assignments for certain classes in my department. This is all the work experience I have over the past two years (my advisor insists I exclude anything I've done in high school.)

The one key thing I feel I'm missing (and feel free to comment if there's any other key components I'm missing) is knowledge in a relevant programming language. I've taken classes in Java and C++ (which are a requirement for my major), but these are apparently not important at all in the actuarial world. For this reason, I feel that I should spend the last couple weeks of my summer and early part of the school year taking a break from exam studying and try to learn something. Is it by any chance possible to teach myself VBA and its applications over the course of a month or two? Perhaps I could do a couple projects in my leisure time just to understand how to adequately use it? How could I go about doing this? I want to know enough so that in an interview I am capable of explaining how I learned it, what ways I've practiced it and of course be able to use it in the real world, at least on a basic level.

P.S. If I fail Exam FM, will my odds of landing an internship be significantly diminished?

Newbie here looking for advice?,8,1,False,False,False,actuary,1501617669,True,"Hey guys, I've found myself in quite a pickle. I'm an upcoming junior this fall, and so far have not started studying for any exams. My background for FM is nonexistent, and I took a course in uni last spring for P. However, I'm taking a course this fall for FM. 

I have study manuals for both exams, but I'm really torn as to which I should dedicate more time for. I know I should've studied for the P exam, but I had other issues come up that prevented me from doing so. 

So my question to any of you is which should I study for first? The exam I have prior knowledge for or the exam I will have more fresh in my head over the course of a semester.

Just want to vent..,6,6,False,False,False,actuary,1501632663,True,"Hey y'all. I'll be taking Online Course 1 tomorrow and I have to say I'm pretty nervous about it. I passed four exams in a row and failed S earlier this year, which was pretty disheartening. I failed with a 5 and it came down to two questions that should have been a breeze. 

Anyway, before right now, I've always felt pretty confident going into exams. I've kept a positive attitude and I know I'll get right back up there if I pass tomorrow. However I'm really afraid about potentially failing tomorrow. It would look pretty bad to my co-workers, I'd have to stay in study mode (which I guess I'll need to get back into anyway to prepare for S again), and it'll knock me even further down mentally.

This exam is supposedly easy, but I think that just raises the stakes. Yeah, 80% of people pass, but I'd really dislike being in that 20%. I can also retake it once more within the same sitting period, but that will end up taking time away from my S studying.

How to get from pure premium to rate or charged premium?,11,3,False,False,False,actuary,1501687223,True,"**TL;DR** I have modeled frequency and severity and computed the pure premiums. How do I proceed to obtain the rates I want to charge individual policy holders? Additionally, what are some alternative ways to do insurance pricing?

I have a dataset with 10k+ observations on individual car insurance policy holders. My aim is to obtain the rates I want to charge individual policy holders. I have information about variables like age, area, etc. plus things like each individual's total amount of claims, how many claims they have had and the duration of their contract.

I fitted a Poisson GLM in R to model the number of claims with duration as an offset, obtaining frequency. I then fitted a Gamma GLM to model the amount of claims only for the observations where the amount of claims was positive as that seemed to be a requirement of the Gamma model and I put the number of claims as a weight argument, obtaining severity. I manually put 0 for the value of severity where the policy holder had no claims as these observations were not used for building the Gamma model.

By multiplying frequency and severity, I obtained pure premiums and I summed them up but this sum was several times lower than the sum of the amount of claims for policy holders, suggesting that my model underestimated the costs. Hopefully, I fitted the models correctly. If so, I wonder how I could improve them.

Anyway, how would I get premiums that I would charge the policy holders? If I wanted a different model, which variable would I model (I assume the amount of claims) and how would I go about obtaining the premiums for individual policy holders from that instead?

Difference between excess and deductible,3,5,False,False,False,actuary,1501922885,True,"Can someone explain the difference between an excess and a deductible? I've seen the following explanation for it, but just wanted further clarificiation:

>A deductible basically reduces the maximum payout, but an excess doesn't. Let's see an example:

>Scenario 1: A policy has sum insured 1,000 and excess of 100:

>If the loss to the insured is 500, the insurer will pay out 400.

>If the loss to the insured is 1,500, the insure will pay out 1,000 (ie the sum insured).

>Scenario 2: A policy has sum insured 1,000 and deductible of 100:

>If the loss to the insured is 500, the insurer will pay out 400

>If the loss to the insured is 1,500, the insure will pay out 900 (ie the sum insured less the deductible).


In the second part of scenario 1, the insurer pays the sum insured, but given that an excess is in operation, does the policyholder still pay 100? Or do they pay the remaining 500?

Similarly, in the second part of scenario 2, I'm assuming the policyholder will cover the remaining 600."

I'm looking for some advice on the actuary career. I've only recently found out about it and started to consider it seriously, and I have heard conflicting information from friends so I'd like some advice from here.


About me:

- I've just finished my sophomore year as of Summer 2017 and I'm graduating in December 2018 (one semester early).

- I've been a computer science major for the past two years, but I've switched it to Statistics and Economics double major. I'm still a computer science minor. My reasons for changing are: I really want to graduate early and could not as a Comp Sci major, I don't really like programming that much and I like math much more, I can't do another summer internship next year (becuase I'm an international student) under the Comp Sci department, and I want to satisfy the VEEs and need the Econ classes for those.

- I'm an international student on an F1 visa (as stated above) and thus I have to do internships on CPT and work on OPT. I have 3 years of OPT before I need a work visa.

- I go to a decent state school, but it's not an ""actuary school"" and there's very few acturial job/internship connections that can be made through my school's career center.

- I have a 3.75 GPA

- I have two summer internship experiences. The first was in my home country at a start up that taught kids computer programming. The second is at a healthcare tech company where I am a product manager. I do work with excel (and VBA) a little bit in this internship. My second internship also strengthened my interest in being an actuary as my company works very closely with insurance companies.

- I have diverse extracuricculars: Vice President of Chess club, E-board position in the Ski Club, member of the orchestra, E-board member in my residence hall last year, on-campus job as a tutor, research in the Political Science department building software.


My questions are: (and any question you can answer will be really helpful!)

1. Is it realistic for me to try to get an acturial internship next summer? To do so means I would have to cram two exams this fall so I can apply for them in time. Keep in mind I haven't taken the P or FM class (taking P in the fall) so i'd have to learn the material on my own.

2. If I can't get an internship, how difficult would it be to get an entry level actuarial job?

3. How saturated is the entry-level actuarial market, really? I have very little knowledge as I've mostly been researching tech companies/market.

4. List of companies that have been known to hire F1 students? Any personal experiences and advice?

5. How much do my non-actuarial internship experiences count toward an entry level actuary job and/or an actuarial internship? Especially considering one was not in the US.

6. How much do extracurricular activities count?

7. I've heard that programming knowledge is useful in the industry. But what specifically is more useful? Machine learning, data analysis, etc.? Also what languages?

8. I have knowledge and experiences in SQL, Java, C, Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Perl, PHP, R. What more computer science classes should I take? Or should I just focus more on stats classes?

9. Any study tips/resources for exams?

10. Keeping in mind all the questions above, and that I have 60 days after graduation to find a job in the US, what should be my game plan for the next few years? Should I try to cram exams and get an internship? Should I just take it at a slower pace and try to get an entry level actuary job? Or should I try to get a job in a related industry and change careers after a few years? Or lastly, should I consider grad school?"

Is being an actuary a lifelong career?,10,0,False,False,False,actuary,1502141100,True,"Apologies in advance if this sort of thing has been answered, but I searched around on the web and couldn't find much, so if you just want to point me somewhere, that's cool too.

I know that it's very common to stop after a bachelors and then begin looking for jobs, and I don't have a problem with this. However, I have also heard that having one career for the rest of your life is sort of a thing of the past (meaning that career and/or ""position jumping"" is much more common than someone working the same job for 30+ years). 

This leads me to the simple question: Do actuaries tend to stay in the same or similar positions for their entire career? If they do not, then what do they instead? Is it easier landing jobs without any grad school (an MBA, masters or PhD) since they have experience as an actuary?

I also took AP Stats, and AP Comp Sci (we learned Java and I didn't do great, I didn't take the AP test but I passed the class, I didn't put the effort in I should have.) 

I plan to attend this community college for two years, after which I'll transfer to a four year, probably a UC. UCSB has an actuarial science program, as does UCLA (both of which I got into once already), and UCSD appears to have a strong math program. 

Anyways, I'm obviously going to be taking my normal classes, taking all of the math classes available, etc. What should I be doing outside of the basics? If I plan to attend college for 4 years and get my bachelors, (or five and get my masters), when should I be taking exams? When should I look for internships? My school only has C++ available as a CS class right now, would it be worth it to self-study C++, Python, SQL and maybe Java or Javascript? And take the class as well? Should I independently try and learn excel, if a class isn't available? 

Basically, if there are things I can be doing now, I want to be doing them. I don't want to end up with my bachelors in four years with only basic programming skills, no knowledge of excel unless I find a class, one or none exams taken, etc. 

I know you guys hate talking about majors, so I'll say that I am most likely going to transfer to UCSB and do their actuarial science program. 

Anyways, thanks for the read, and the help if you give it. You guys seem like a group of nice people so I figured asking here couldn't hurt.

I'm sorry if this question has been asked before. I was wondering if the TIA package for C can completely replace the manual. I'm not going to lie, I hate reading the manual and I don't get too much out of it - a majority of my learning comes from practice problems and the video solutions from adapt. I'm trying to figure out a way to avoid reading/buying the 1000+ page manual for this exam. Can anyone give me their insight on using this package as opposed to the traditional ASM + Adapt combo (I've done that for the previous exams but this manual is definitely the longest by far). I plan on starting to study sometime next month for the February sitting.

Could someone explain rate change - UK Lloyd's,7,1,False,False,False,actuary,1502218642,True,"I get the rate change methodology as specified out by PMD, where you have your expiring premium, change due to limits, coverage, and other and effectively build up to your renewal risk at expiring rates. From this we can get the rate change by comparing to the actual premium.

I have also read online that rate change is defined by the change in rate adequacy and that the PMD is measure the change in rate adequacy. For instance, define rate adequacy by premium/modelled premium. If the rate adequacy was at renewal, 120% and at expiring 100% (i.e. you charged 20 percent more than what the model has suggested, and the same as what the model has suggested respectively) then the rate change is 120/100 - 1 i.e. 20 percent increase. How is this, intuitively, the same as what the Lloyd's PMD says?

What's the role of a pricing actuary in speciality lines/Lloyd's market?,6,8,False,False,False,actuary,1502309179,True,"I'm currently working at a syndicate, and I am still relatively new so perhaps I'm being naive but what exactly is the role of pricing actuaries at these places? The place I'm working it is very very underwriting driven, they talk with the brokers, they decide on the price, and they care about broker relationship and sometimes write terrible risks just to keep a relationship with a broker. In this case, the pricing actuary is just an assistant to the underwriter in a way, they may have a model which says the premium should be this but there is no obligation to follow it and most of the time it is just used as a base number.

I understand in casualty pricing actuaries may be useful, due to being a long tailed business - but that's mainly reserving focused rather than anything else. I also see the need for reserving and capital actuaries, but for pricing other than rate monitoring what else is there? It seems as though it is just a nice addition to have to an underwriting team, rather than a necessary member - especially for short tail classes like property, they would rather talk to exposure management than actuarial.

Perhaps it's just my place which is like this - appreciate any input."

They were saying that people were just totally incapable of doing vlookups or nested if functions. One person even said that being able to do conditional formatting makes you at least an 8/10.

"Welp, I am going to switch to accounting: a cautionary tale",22,1,False,False,False,actuary,1502365090,True,"Greetings!  I hope this finds you well.


After over a year of searching for an actuarial position, I have reached the end of my rope.  I will give it one last shot for this month, but after that I am going to take up the offer of the accounting firm I am at and begin the journey to CPA.

So, I have a warning to all those youngsters looking to be an actuary: ask yourself the following:

1. Are you in the top 20% in terms of qualifications?
1. Are you in the top 20% in terms of interviewing skills?
1. If not, are you capable of getting to the top 20%?

If you answered 'No' to 1 or 2, and 3, then really look inside yourself and ask if you want to go down this path.  I am not saying it is impossible, just extremely difficult.  The Entry level market is heavily saturated, with estimates from hiring managers I spoke to giving me a 1:4 to 1:5 jobs to candidates ratio.  Their are success stories of underachievers on this very subreddit, but those are lottery winners, not the norm.
 But if you answered 'No' to 1 or 2 but 'Yes' to 3, here is some advice:

Networking: surprisingly straightforward

1. If you are still in school, find insurance or related conferences!  They usually offer big discounts to students, or are even free.  Find the faculty with links to said conferences, they can also get you in.

1. Bring resumes and business cards, lots of them.  I have found you can very forward when speaking in person, and can usually ask if they have actuarial positions directly.  Have the said professor in 1a introduce you to key persons.

2. On LinkedIn and cold e-mailing, you have to dance around a bit.  Ask for only one piece of advice on how to 'break into' the field.  Do not spam all the actuaries at a certain company; try to send to directors and other higher ups.

3.  Join candidate connect on the SOA and student connect on the CAS.  Listen to their entry level webinars.

If you have the Dollars, use them!

1. Get a job coach if you can afford them, especially if you are getting interviews and not offers.  Even if they are not specialized to your field, they can be an invaluable resource (make sure to get a good one though)

1. Get the infinite actuaries technical skills course: it will look good on resumes and hopefully keep you refreshed on your technical skills.

1. If there is happy hour or similar event nearby, attend it!  They usually do not cost much and you can be more forward asking for jobs.  (I would not recommend drinking though, bring sparkling water or something if you want to fit in more)

Interview skills: more important than qualifications

1. It is true.  Because the field is so saturated, having merely good or even very good interviewing skills is not enough.  You must have the best interview skills of any candidate the company is interviewing.  Spoiler!  It is a lot of people.

1. Practice in mock interviews with career counselors or the job coach, if applicable.  Read up on forums how to pass behavioral actuarial questions.  Get a nice suit and make sure it is clean.  You must master every type of interview, from phone and video to group and panel.

1. Ask for feedback after interviews.  Be prepared for ""you did well on you interview and I did not notice any mistakes.  There were just better candidates.""

1. And the most important advice of all, have a back up plan.  Look at those ratios I posted earlier.  Simple math dictates 75% to 80% of you will not get an actuarial job.  Although I may be disappointed I am not getting into the field, I will be fine knowing I have my tunnels dug with the accounting job.

This is a bitter pill to swallow for some of you, but I do hope you can make it.

FAQ

Q: So what stopped you?

A: Although I did follow my own advice above, I was only able to get merely good at interviewing, in spite of my job coach and practice.

Q: Why are you at an accounting firm right now?

A: To pay the bills, as well as to have professional experience."

But, a positive is that you are on your own time for the most part.  So, I can keep up with my entry level actuarial job search and keep up with my other part-time gigs (Uber Driving, etc).

Is Actuarial Science Right for Me?,26,2,False,False,False,actuary,1502683377,True,"Hi there. I've currently got some questions about actuarial science that go beyond the basic answers found on beanactuary.org, actuary outpost, etc.

I'm currently a 17 year old high school senior looking at applying to colleges. For a while now, I've been considering actuary science and I'm wondering if this is going to be a good decision. I've always been good at math, scoring a perfect 800 on my SAT math section without prep but only a 34 on ACT math. Last year I took AB Calculus and got a 5 on the AP test. That's when I fell in love with Calculus and this year, my senior year, I'm taking BC Calculus and student teaching AB. 

I've heard actuary math and the tests, however, are a whole new beast. My current ""life plan"" would be to be an actuary, make enough money to retire by 60ish at the latest, then maybe be a Calculus teacher in retirement. Does this seem like a bad idea? Math and risk do fascinate me but I'm sure you all have some advice.

Also, what universities have the best reputation? A lot of websites have University of Illinois ranked pretty high and that's my state school. Their website says it prepares you for 5 tests but after reading some stuff about the tests, that seems a little too good to be true.

To me that's just rent-seeking. You're raising the price without adding any value. You're charging people for being too lazy to switch to another insurance company, or punishing them for not switching fast enough. If every insurance company uses price optimization then it's effectively a cartel without any verbal agreement.

Advice for recent grad trying to return to field?,9,2,False,False,False,actuary,1502724626,True,"I got a B.S. in Math/Act. Sci in 2014 from a Big 10 university, never got an internship (not for lack of trying) and stayed at the university for another year working on a masters, in an attempt to have one more chance at getting a summer internship, which was unsuccessful. I sat for all five exams, passed P and FM, failed the other 3. My grades in grad school were less-than-stellar, so I cut my losses and joined AmeriCorps, where I've been for two years now, learning carpentry and other useful, yet non-actuarial skills. Masters was not completed.

My contract with AmeriCorps is ending soon, and it's time to find a real job. I haven't completely forgotten my training with math, stats, etc. but I basically haven't been practicing those things at all for two years, and I've gotten a little rusty. I want to start applying for EL positions, but feel under qualified because I've kind of ""gone cold"" actuarially. I know that exam progress is important, and fluency with computers (Excel, R, Python, etc.) is as well, but as I said I've quite fallen out of practice with all of these, and whenever I think about picking up somewhere to start practicing again, I feel overwhelmed and unsure of what's most important.

Does the community have any advice/insight into what's the best approach to re-ignite the actuarial engines, and make myself a competitive job-seeker? Is it as simple as just trying to sit for the next MFE and not focusing on anything else? Or just focus on relearning programming? Both? I feel like my brain is in knots. Your advice is appreciated."

Summer internship advice,2,3,False,False,False,actuary,1502737718,True,"I recently decided I wanted to pursue a career as an actuary at the beginning of the summer. I just passed exam FM last week and I am sitting for P on September 25th. I am confident I will pass P because I have taken multiple probability courses in college. I am also out of summer classes next week so I will have a month to do nothing but Adapt exams. 

My question is whether or not I should hold off on applying to internships for next summer until after I pass exam P. I know that companies have already started looking for interns so I will be slightly behind if I wait until the end of September. I was just wondering if you guys thought I would have a better shot at getting a good internship with 2 exams starting to apply in six weeks, or one exam and starting to apply now. Thanks!"

Failed exam FM,19,3,False,False,False,actuary,1502756654,True,"I know nobody cares but I needed to let it out. I got ""low"" on everything. I know most people say this, but I really honestly thought I did better than that. At least when I failed Exam P on my first attempt, I had one ""high.""

Does low on everything mean I got a 0?"
Dumb Exam P question on joint distribution,5,1,False,False,False,actuary,1502757944,True,"So I'm doing this problem in the ACTEX book: ""Let X and Y denote the values of two stocks at the end of a five year period. X is uniformly distributed on the interval (0,12). Given X=x, Y is uniformly distributed on the interval (0,x). Determine Cov(X,Y) according to this model.""

So the way I went about it was I found the double integral of c with 0<y<x and 0<x<12 and set that equal to c. I got c=1/72. Then I found E[XY]-E[X]*E[Y] When f(x,y)=1/72. Long story short, I got 4. 

Now I am absolutely confused because the book went about it as finding the distribution on the x axis and y axis. By that I mean they took 1/12 (the ""distribution"" on the x axis) and 1/x (the ""distribution"" on the y axis) and multiplied them. So basically, their ""c"" was 1/12x. 

Then they found the expected value of xy and y by finding the double integral of y/12 and y/12x (respectively). Then they found the expected value of x as 6 because X is uniformly distributed on (0,12), so it would have to be 6. Their final answer to the question was 6. 

So I am not sure where to start with my confusion. I thought we found the ""c"" by finding the double integral of a constant and setting it equal to 1. But then they found it by (I think) assuming that the distribution is discrete and not continuous. Should I always make this assumption unless told otherwise? Also, for the expected value of X, I found it was 8, which looking back at how they did it, makes no sense. Could someone clarify where I've gone wrong on this problem? If it helps, I can provide my own calculations. Thank you!

P.S. I apologize for using ""c"" and ""distribution"". I'm not sure the proper language I should be using here"

2) Or, should I put sitting MFE in March of 2018 and also put down that I'm currently taking the applied stats course somewhere else on my resume to show that I'm currently not just bumming around?

Fresh Grad Resume Critique,21,2,False,False,False,actuary,1502848404,True,"Hi! Would anyone give my resume a look and kindly give me suggestions/ critics/ advice? 

I am a fresh graduate (graduated in June). I am well aware my standing is pretty weak to obtain an entry level actuary position (low gpa therefore not stated, no internships, and having just one exam passed). In addition to actuarial jobs, I will also try to go for non-actuarial jobs as well (e.g. entry financial analyst) because of my finance background.

I know that my resume's longer than a page now (I'm planning to keep it within one page after editing)

If I'm applying for an actuarial job, I'll push the ""credentials"" part up and it will say ""Actuarial Exams""

- Should I keep the summary part? or an objective saying ""i want a job"" would do? or nothing at all?
- Since I have no experience, I included ""Related Coursework/ Projects"" part to showcase what I did in school and the skills I have. I will tailor the list depending on the job I'm applying to. Is this part redundant and I should keep it off?

Oh and I'm an international student if you have any comments/ insights on that.

Any comment/ criticism / advice to any part of my post/ resume will be appreciated. Thank you!

Video Lessons,14,3,False,False,False,actuary,1502915961,True,"I used the coaching actuaries videos for FM and loved them. I learn very well from Coack K's style of teaching. I recently got the MFE video lessons from coaching actuaries since it went so well the first time. 

Although there is sometimes an improvement in graphics there are also way more verbals mess ups. It feels like they obviously knew the speaker messed up at parts and just decided it wasn't worth their time to do another take. I would be ok with this since I like Coach K's style so much except they often have other people teaching instead like Tong and some Jewish guy that I honestly really dislike learning from.

How are the other coaching actuaries video lessons? What percentage of the time is Coach K in them versus some other person? 

What would be some good alternatives and why?

Preparing my resume for an internship search starting next month. Need advice.,3,2,False,False,False,actuary,1502945722,True,"http://imgur.com/BzfigHk

I know it is far from perfect, and that's why I am posting here. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to pass FM on Monday, so now I'll have to wait until October to try again. Fortunately, I do have P under my belt, and that's enough to meet the minimum requirements in most cases.

My main questions:
1. It seems that including ""relevant coursework"" is something frowned upon on here. Is this true? I was recommended to put down coursework by both of my advisors last year, but it turns out the unwritten rules could be different in the actuarial world. If this is the case, what should I use the space for?
2. I work for my campus newspaper, but I've held three different positions. I started out as a freelance writer, than became a section editor, and now I am set to be the copy editor for this upcoming semester. I'm not exactly sure what the best way to break this down is. Should I just say that I'm the copy editor and leave off the rest? Or should I create a separate section for each position?

Any other honest advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

Considering becoming an Actuarial Analyst,18,3,False,False,False,actuary,1503019127,True,"I graduated last year with my degree in Finance and accepted a job straight out of school as a Data Analyst. I enjoyed working with the SQL and some of the analyzing of reports.

I've been doing research on what actuarial analysts do, and I'm intrigued. I just have a few questions though. As of right now, I've only taken through Calc 1 and was wondering if it would be worth it to complete the Calc series, or just start studying for the exams?  Also, since I'm out of school and don't have the opportunity for internships through a University, what would be my best course of action to get my foot in the door? Is it as simply as completing a couple of exams and becoming a desirable candidate? I have about a year of SQL experience with a solid Excel background to boot.

Exam 4/C or Exam S,17,1,False,False,False,actuary,1503407796,True,"I just got my job offer (property pricing), and I start in 2 weeks.

How do i know that I'm suitable for Actuary?,5,0,False,False,False,actuary,1503442223,True,"I'm 17, and I am going to apply for universities soon. I just got to know about actuary and I really like the idea of how you assess the risks using maths and try to communicate with the others. My biggest concern is if my level of maths is good enough. 

I'm currently doing the IB Curriculum, and I'm doing Higher Level Maths as one of my subjects. I struggled initially and I have gotten better, but not good enough. The highest grade is a 7, and I'm getting somewhere between a 5 and a 6, with 5 being more frequent. However, I chose the Stats option and we are just about to start it. We did a stats chapter before and I really enjoyed it. I also liked the chapter of conditional probability. 

Also, I want to know how is it like working as an actuary. Is it stressful? On average, how many hours do you work in a week? And what advice would you give to a person seeking to start as an actuary?

Raises For First Years,14,1,False,False,False,actuary,1503486539,True,Hi.  This is my first year working as an actuary.

I started with a fairly competitive EL salary and have gotten standard exam raises.  Would I also get a 2% merit raise?  Smaller?  Bigger?  Does it compound on exam raises or just starting salary?  How did your early raises work?

Job Description Too Large?,9,6,False,False,False,actuary,1503525068,True,"I am feeling like my department's breadth of job responsibilities is simply too large for my role.  I would love thoughts from others.

Currently, I am explicitly tasked with:

* Developing and validating of pricing model for new products, including sensitivity tests and projections
* Maintaining, updating, and analyzing quarterly profit projection models for all life products
* Developing entirety of product specifications for new life product
* Leading forms design process with lawyers and compliance staff for new products
* Reviewing and approving IT systems/testing requirements for new products and product changes
* Providing custom health and life pricing for new commercial bids (about 24 per year) for jumbo accounts
* Reviewing training materials and marketing material for new products
* Managing filing and implementation of rate increases nationwide for new products
* Managing process of monthly data warehouse loads
* Assisting with product filing work, including act memos, objection responses
* Performing ad hoc financial analyses for existing renewal pricing bids for about 50 groups per year
* Testing of new market support tools and manual review of admin system output for new product implementations
* Building out implementation documentation such as rate cards, product rules, rate generators

Inexplicit Ad Hoc work includes:

* Responding to questions from outside brokers on functionality of new products and pricing questions
* Pulling statistical data for internal and business partner requests that come through our distribution team
* Consulting on experience analyses done annually
* Reviewing claims data for accounts on an ad hoc basis

I feel stretched out and am worried about burnout.  I am not sure how to change things because the other two credentialed actuaries also do all the same things for their respective product lines.  One has a staff of 4 while the other has a staff of 1 but works 60+ hours per week.  (I am an individual contributor)  I've had to work 50-60 hour weeks the past 4 months, I'm starting to lose hope that my workload will ever diminish.  I'm also worried about potential fallout of asking for less work.

I thought 2 months ago I'd be promoted after getting my FSA, so I was hopeful that at least I'd be making a lot, but management only gave me the stipulated amount for attaining FSA.  Therefore, I only make $110-115k with bonus included.  I know that's still good money but I don't feel like it's more than market average.

I've felt around on the possibility of being promoted to a manager, but the feedback is that I ""produce too much good work as a contributor and there is concern with the maintenance bandwidth of a direct report"".  I'm concerned in the medium term that advancement will be slower than I want, they haven't promoted a new person to a manager role in 7+ years, and there doesn't seem to be appetite to change people's roles.

r/actuary, what should I look at changing or doing differently?  "

Is this career field for me?,9,0,False,False,False,actuary,1503606891,True,"Hey everyone, 
I am a dual major in Accounting and Finance and will be a senior this coming semester.  I've heard of actuaries before but just recently started looking into them as a career possibility.

I have a few concerns after doing some research and reading through some posts on the subreddit.  

Firstly I don't have a crazy high gpa.  I'm sitting at a 3.08 right now which seems super low compared to others based on their resumes they have posted.  Secondly I haven't had any internship opportunities as of yet for either of my degrees.  Lastly, how is the job outlook?  Compared to a career field such as accounting I'm not sure how to feel about it.  Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics there is higher job outlook for an actuary than accountants but the number of current actuary jobs is significantly less than those in accounting.  Assuming I meet the requirements to apply for an actuary position is there really a good chance of finding a job compared to say accounting?  I understand there is a much higher barrier to entry for an actuary than a job in accounting but it still seems like a turn off.

That being said, pursuing a career as an actuary interests me but I really don't know if it's for me.

Edit:
Thanks for everyone's feedback.  Seems it would be best to continue my current degree plan.  Thanks for everyone's responses."
My areas of improvement in regards to Exam P.,2,3,False,False,False,actuary,1503615132,True,"Along with trying to learn a programming language, I've been studying for this exam for the past two months. The reason being I haven't touched most of the material in about a year and since I had the time I figured I should use it to better my chances of passing (I'm sitting for it in September). I've taken multiple exams on Adapt and have an EL of 5.9 right now but here are the biggest areas I could improve in:


1. Making sure I've written numbers down correctly or calculating answers correctly. I've gotten multiple questions wrong because I should have had x^3 but instead I wrote down x^2, or forgetting to square root a number. I believe this is mostly because I'm rushing the question and not paying attention.


2. Conditional Probability and Independence. My struggle with these questions is how they are worded can be confusing sometimes in regards to what they are looking for.

3. Multivariate Distributions: Bivariate Uniform. I can't say exactly why I'm struggling with these questions. This section has the lowest pass rate out of all of them but thankfully I have another month to improve. 

4. Law of Total Variance. I only get one or two questions dealing with this in my practice exams but I always forget about it. It's only after I've given up on how to solve and I see the answer that I'm like ""Duh! Law of Total Variance ya dummy!"".


For those that have taken it or are going to be taking it, what were/are your problem areas and how did you improve?

Help deciding between two EL job offers,7,1,False,False,False,actuary,1503686755,True,"Hey all!

I was lucky enough in the past week to receive two entry-level job offers. Both offers are relatively similar in terms of salary/benefits package, with the only differences coming from location and the type of business each one does. Both are Fortune 500 companies at essentially the same ranking.

* Company 1 is a direct insurer that also does a lot of financial services. The company is relatively large (10k+ employees) with a much smaller actuarial pool (&lt;300 actuaries). They offer their actuarial students two-year rotations in different departments. The company is in a relatively small city.

* Company 2 is a large reinsurer. I have been interning at this company for the past half year. It's a smaller company compared to Company 1 (&lt;5k employees) with a larger actuarial pool. There is no rotation in the plans, rather the offer is for a position in risk management. The company is in a larger city, as well as my hometown. 

I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts regarding which type of place is better to start an actuarial career in. I've heard some people mention that students learn a lot more from working in direct writers as opposed to reinsurers.

Also, does anyone have any experience working at a company that uses Flexible Time Off as opposed to the standard PTO?

Should I accept my job offer?,19,1,False,False,False,actuary,1503938794,True,"This summer I was working an internship for an insurance company and was offered a return offer to work full time after I graduate.  However, there are a few issues in my mind.  First, it's a P&amp;C job which isn't my preferred route due to the fact that it seems like I will have to take much more exams that route.  Is this a valid concern?  So far I have three exams passed and was planning on taking MLC in October but that won't help my if I go this route.  

Secondly, the pay seems to be on the lower end from what I can see for people with three exams.  It will be lower 60 thousands in a large city, which seems low to me.  And from what I can tell raises seem hard to come by, other than exam based raises, is this the norm?

Background: I work in product development in life, FSA.  Also, I'm considering asking for a little more salary.

**Current role:**

* Manage pricing and product design for one product line at a time, but then the product is ""taken away"" after the product rollout is complete 
* Received company awards, good reviews, on good terms with my manager 
* Good relationship with my Boss' boss and other senior managers
* Current salary $110k with 5% annual bonus target
* Potential for promotion to $120-$125k with 8% bonus but likely not for 3-6 months
* Currently have 1 hour commute each way as spouse is in grad school
* Currently doing about 50-55 hours/week on top of commute
* Recently offered potential direct report for 1st time ever, but wouldn't start until January
* Promotions and raises in my team are more on the gradual side, no one has really ""moved up"" or ""moved around"" in awhile.


**New Potential Role:**

* Manage rollout of 3 new product lines for 1st time ever for another F500 (same products I work with now)
* Seemingly great potential to manage all 3 products and grow with the business
* Role will be virtual but with 30% travel, probably just as many hours or more but no regular commute
* Salary $125,000 with 20% target cash bonus
* No direct reports but with product development support teams (marketing, attorneys, actuarial, UW, etc)
* Management seem high energy and smart, but my manager and his boss work on west coast, I would be on the east coast

Advice for passing November MFE with 11 weeks to study,17,1,False,False,False,actuary,1504197769,True,"The title is pretty self explanatory.

Is there anyone else here doing the same thing or has already done it? I'm just looking for advice on how to tackle this exam with a shorter than average study period. I have seen a few other threads on this topic, but they're a bit older and I know the syllabus changes somewhat frequently. 

I have already purchased an adapt subscription and am planning on going through a manual quick enough to leave myself at least a month to hammer out tons of problems and practice exams. 

I have seen Actuarial Brew mentioned here a few times for MFE. Since money is tight, I am considering buying their manual instead of ASM or Actex, but just want to make sure I'm not making a mistake in doing so.

Pricing question,14,3,False,False,False,actuary,1504350118,True,"I'm not an actuary in any sense, but I was looking for an answer regarding in insurance pricing.

Why do single payments to life insurance  policies require more capital that scheduled payments.

For example. Sample paid up policy prices, $1.2mm benefit.

Single pay - 323k
vs
Payment of 100k then 10 payments of 17k.

I don't need a pricing analysis but wouldn't theoretically insurance companies rather have the full capital up front to work with, their liability is the same.  The above is real pricing, I know it wasn't always this way.  Even if low interest rates are a factor, why would they price like this?


Additional info: to clear confusion this was from the same insurance company, just the pricing on different premium structures.   While it makes sense that the pricing is backwards, could it be the fact that the insurance company does not want the lump sum, as either from interest rates or expected investment returns they feel this is a bad time to take money, or they've taken too much?  Also fwiw no cash value component to these policies."

Actuarial students at my school typically get internships the summer after their third year, but because I'll be graduating, I'm kinda screwed for that.

Here are pros and cons of either choice.

Pros of Master's: 

* only one year

* internship/research project with a actuarial-related company will be assigned for each student

* I can look for internships in the upcoming career fair

* get to make some money as a TA

* enjoy student life a bit more

Cons of Master's: 

* many say it's a waste 

* I'll have one year without being able to pass any exams (not sure SOA or CAS)

* I don't even like academia.  

Pros of seeking employment:

* I have exams and technical skills 

* get a head start

* be independent 

* get to pass more exams without taking an year long break, assuming that I get hired

Cons of seeking employment:

* no internship :(

* maybe I'm rushing life

* perhaps I should gain some more knowledge first

[Advice] Work vs Exams,6,2,False,False,False,actuary,1504533147,True,"In Toronto*

I have a job from a startup company of 4 MBA guys, for the position of a general analyst that I started on friday. They work in consulting in a revenue management firm and work crazy hours (65+) I am not getting paid for overtime either unfortunately and my salary for the 6 month probation period is really low. The job and field is unrelated to actuarial work, however I can still learn a lot by working with these smart people.

I want to start studying for MFE in november as well, however I dont think I will have enough time after work to study for it and be successful. 

Should I continue with this job and ultimately slow down my exam progression (only have P and FM right now). Or study full time for exams? I might also have the option to teach math at an after school highschool program part time (8 hours a week) which I can take on aswell and still be successful studying instead of being completely unemployed. I will then be able to write C in february as well next year, as otherwise with the analyst Job I would not be able to for sure.

About to start looking for full-time at the career fair in two weeks. I have a few questions + resume proofread would appreciated!,2,2,False,False,False,actuary,1504589357,True,"Hey r/actuary,

I know there's a lot of these posts due to the timing of recruiting and interviewing but if anyone has time to look over my resume I would greatly appreciate it.

https://imgur.com/s6Qm88l

I left some things off there that I had on my previous resume (like part-time work experience, intramural sports, club participation, etc) that I'll just bring up in the interview if asked about but I really wanted to keep it short and have it be one full page instead of one page filled and another page 1/4 filled.

Any tips for me? Suggestions are welcome. 

If salary comes up in one of the finalizing interviews, what is a good response to that question? Would asking for $70k+ be appropriate given that I'm a great candidate?

Also, this school year there is a chance I will be doing research 
on predictive analytics and machine learning with actuarial science applications which is an area I'd love to explore more. Does anyone know of any companies that let their employees explore some of that stuff and really put their technical skills to use? Feel free to send me a PM.

Thanks in advance."
Working a non actuarial job while applying to actuarial jobs,8,3,False,False,False,actuary,1504612524,True,"I wanted to gather opinions on a ""career move"" I've sort of been considering. I graduated a year ago with a combined math &amp; econ degree. I did one 6 month actuarial internship with a major life insurance company and a previous 6 month internship with a major investment bank. I was not offered a full time actuarial position at the end of my internship because I did not yet have any exams passed (December 2015). After that, I took quite a while to make up my mind and really commit  to taking the exams, but eventually I did and I passed FM in December 2016 and then P this May. I am currently studying for MFE this November. 

I am not in any way a fan of my current job. It is technically in insurance, but I do nothing seriously analytical and it is low paying ($15/hr). I accepted it at the time because I was having a tough time finding a job and wanted something that would be flexible enough to continue studying so I could apply to more actuarial jobs this fall.

I was a D1 athlete in college and was recently offered a coaching position at an elite high school club down the street from my house. I would be working alongside my best friend and would make the same amount of money working less than half the time. I love everything about this opportunity - especially the massive increase in study time - but am concerned about not working a ""real"" job while applying to actuarial ones. 

This brings me to my main question: would it look ""bad"" to work a non-insurance or even non-office job while applying to actuarial positions? At the end of the day, I still have a math degree from a top school, 2 exams (working on a third), and internship experience at a big company. I know sports isn't actuarial in any sense, but I do feel it would at the very least demonstrate leadership ability.

Need help deciding on which exam to study for first...,6,0,False,False,False,actuary,1504718765,True,"Hi fellow actuaries of Reddit, I was wondering if anyone had any advice on which exam would be the best to take to get my foot in the door. 

For starters, my junior year of high school I had taken College Stats (A) and Pre-Calc (A+), then I had taken AP Calc AB (B+) and Intro to Java (A-) my senior year of high school.

Right now I'm starting my first semester at Pitt, and I'm taking Calc again, Financial Accounting, and Intro. to Logic, Comp 2, and Freshman Seminar... Calc is somewhat of a blow-off class, since I had already taken it in high school. And Accounting isn't terrible by any means, but my brain is more wired to think in terms of fractions, percentages, ratios, etc., rather than in terms of real-world applications at the moment. As I continue my education, I believe this will change, but for now I'm more of a straight data guy. Overall, I found my Stats class much easier than my calc class in high school.

So would it be smarter if I studied for Exam P, since I have a mindset more wired towards these subjects already, or would it be better to study for Exam FM? Any thoughts? I had heard P was significantly harder than FM, so all future actuaries should take FM first... is this true?"

"Prospective ELs and interns, read this post for all the advice you'll ever need need about your resumes",34,61,False,False,False,actuary,1504740738,True,"Be warned, this post is going to be long and some of it is going to be a little vulgar. The vulgarity is for emphasis so the message sticks.

I will be making the rounds at the local universities soon, and I will be looking at more college resumes than I care to think about. 50% of them will be shit. 30% of them will be partially shit. Here's how to make sure you are in the other 20%. That 20% gets interviews.

I have hundreds of these things to wade through, so on my first pass-through I’m only going to be looking for four things. Here they are, from what I care most about to what I care least about.

* Is this person looking for an internship or a FT position?

* How many exams does this person have?

* Does this person have a prior internship or at least other relevant white collar office experience?

* What is this person’s GPA?

The best thing that you can do is improve these fundamentals. That’s the long-term goal. People with good fundamentals get hired even if their resume is in Comic Sans and they misspell the word “actuary”.

But hiring season is upon us and it’s too late to improve your GPA or pass another exam, so let’s talk short-term.

The next-best thing that you can do is make it easy for me to find these things. I am spending *maybe* 30 seconds on your resume during the first pass-through. If I can find all of the above items in 10 seconds, that means you get 20 seconds for me to peruse the rest. If I have that extra 20 seconds, then I’m more likely to see that your hobby is painting watercolor portraits of dinosaurs. Guess what? Unless he has no exams or his GPA is shit, Dinosaur Kid is getting an interview, because I can at least remember something about him.

Seriously, most of you guys are fucking boring on paper. Please include a hobbies and interests section, and then include hobbies and interests that you actually find interesting. If you volunteer at a food bank but think it’s boring as shit, DON’T PUT IT ON YOUR RESUME. Put down things that you can demonstrate enthusiasm for. A genuine demonstration of enthusiasm is one of the giant, GIANT green flags in an interview. So include things you like talking about!

At the end of the day, the hiring process comes down to one question:

* Do I want to work with this person every day?

That’s it. So to the extent that we can see what you are actually like as a person, that only helps. Unless you are weird as fuck. But if you are, that’s probably going to come out anyway. The answer is to stop being weird as fuck. But OK yeah, if your hobby is making fetish porn, don’t put that on your resume. That’s creepy. But too many people leave their actual interests off because they think they’re irrelevant or they won’t help them get hired. YES, THEY WILL. Don’t overemphasize those things, but they should be on there at the bottom.

Let’s pause here for a few assorted thoughts:

* No one cares about Dean’s List. Dean’s List is driven by GPA, which is on your resume. Unless you totally tanked your freshman year and are selling me a great turnaround story and your evidence for that is that you made Dean’s List this past semester, I don’t care.

* I assume you will have done the relevant coursework. *Oh, this person took Calc II? Who knew?* Unless you have a totally unconventional major like Dance and you need to demonstrate that you might actually know what a probability density function is, leave the list of coursework off. It’s just more eye-clutter that makes it harder for me to find the four things I’m looking for on the first read-through.

* None of us is expecting references, so you don’t need to say anything about them being available on request.

Now let’s talk about the second big thing, writing. Particularly as it pertains to the bullet point descriptions that go with your jobs and hobbies.

Most of y’all can’t write worth shit. That’s OK. Most people in the business world can’t write worth shit, either. But for God’s sake, at least try to write clearly.

Channel Ernest Hemingway. Short, declarative sentences. No adverbs. Especially not -ly adverbs. *Especially* not “efficiently”. And no infinitive phrases, either. I see “in order to x” all the time. Rewrite your damn sentence.

I want to know *what you did* at your job or in your club leadership role. You will not impress me with eloquent phrasing; you will only gunk up your sentences and make it harder for me to understand what you did.

This isn’t an exam where you put down everything you can think of hoping to get partial credit. Nor do you need to dress things up in grandiose language. We can see right through that. Here is an example:

&gt; Facilitated efficient service by maintaining store equipment in order to be better able to adapt to customer interactions

I have no idea what the fuck this means. I see this kind of shit all the time. (Usually with a few grammar errors sprinkled in.) Let’s try this instead:

&gt; Repaired and performed routine maintenance on ice cream machines

Hey, I understand what that means! And it shows me that you can write well. And when I’m interviewing you, I can latch onto the phrase “ice cream machines” and ask you a question about it. Concreteness is good. Nouns are good, particularly nouns that you can see and feel. You'd be amazed how few concrete nouns most people use on their resume. In the first example, there’s nothing easy for me to latch onto, so I’m probably not going to ask you anything about it.

Avoid filler words. They add nothing and take up precious time and space. “Responsible for” is a classic. Instead of “responsible for tutoring…” why not just put “tutored…”?

Also, pay attention to verb parallelism. Your verb tenses should agree. It shouldn’t be hard to keep the tenses aligned if you are using simple sentences with lots of concrete nouns. If you currently hold the position, use the simple present tense. If it’s a former position, use the simple past tense. Easy.

Now, formatting.

Your formatting should be consistent. If you use a period at the end of one bullet point, use a period at the end of all of them. If you have 5 sections, the headers should all look the same and the spacing before and after them should all look the same.

Your resume should not be *pretty*. IT SHOULD BE EASY TO READ. These formatting tips aren’t here because actuaries are pedantic assholes who are offended at an almost moral level by trivial inconsistencies. (Though most of us are.) These tips are so your resume conveys the maximum amount of information with a minimum amount of effort required from the person reading it. If you have an extra space after one of your bullets, we don’t care because it shows a lack of attention to detail (though that is true, too); we care because it’s distracting to the eye.

Use one font. Use at most two font sizes. You probably shouldn’t use all-caps for anything. Bold text, bullets, and indentations help convey the hierarchy of information and which items get grouped together at which level. That is the only reason to use them.

The standard is that dates should be right-aligned, and everything else that isn’t your name and contact info should be left-aligned. This is what we interviewers will be expecting. If things are in a weird order or a weird place, that’s wasted time for us that could have been spent paying attention to something that will make you memorable.

Oh, and if you had an internship last summer and worked at a hot dog stand the summer before that, the internship should have more bullets and more detailed bullets than the hot dog job. Not all experience is equal.

And now the last thing **and maybe the most important thing**

Have people look at your resume. You might have just read through this massive post, but you didn’t grok everything I said at an intuitive level. You need help. But the right kind of help.

Your mom is going to think your resume looks great. Of course, she still has that drawing of a ""dog"" you did in first grade that looks more like a yak with glandular problems. Your mom thinks anything you do is great. She isn’t going to be brutally honest.

Your roommate has never hired anybody. The people at your university’s career services center probably haven’t either. If they knew how to write a good resume they would have real jobs.

No, if you want good feedback from people who know what they are talking about and aren’t afraid to be an asshole about how much your resume sucks, post it here.

Post it here. That’s the biggest thing you can do.

Though you have to have one written first. And it has to be up-to-date. That’s not true for 75% of you. So go write one, TONIGHT, and then reread this post and edit it yourself TOMORROW, and then post it here.

The entire reason you went to college and took actuarial courses was so you could get a good job as an actuary. Why the fuck wouldn’t you do everything possible to maximize your chances?"

NEED HELP: Engineering to Actuary?,22,2,False,False,False,actuary,1504853402,True,"Hi

I'm currently a Chemical Engineering student at UCL and have been interested in becoming an actuary for a few years now, to the point where I now realise I should have applied to an actuarial science course at university. 

I just wanted to ask if it is possible for engineering students to become actuaries, what does it take, and what can I do now to pave the way for my future career as an actuary.

I literally don't know where to start apart from the fact that you need to take exams to become a trainee actuary and get experience before you become a real actuary, but I don't know anything else.

If someone could please help me to understand the process, if it is even possible for me, and if i'm at any disadvantage by doing an engineering degree. i'd also like to understand how many years it would take to become a fully qualified actuary after I finish my undergraduate degree in chem eng.

Please help me out

Thank you!"

And to start I need a fellow of the SOA or any western actuarial society. The advantage for the fellow is that the work load is minimal and even his or her presence in Saudi Arabia is not required. 

I am willing to consider a sales royalty and/or salary arrangement. Any takers or advice on how to proceed?

I’m graduating in December and it’s currently the actuarial recruiting season in my province (Canada). Just wanted some advice on how to approach the job search.


I’m currently interviewing at my one of my previous employers (top choice), but the process is slow (and very selective), and the final decision will only be made by beginning to mid-October.


I’ve been applying to several few full-time jobs (Canada and USA), but most companies where I live (that I'm interested in) only hire their former interns. I’m debating if I should apply to their internships as a backup, should I not get the full-time offers. 


Background : 3.8+ GPA, 4 exams, 4 internships, lots of leadership experience. I would consider myself a strong candidate, but I don’t want to be too overconfident given the competitive EL market. Do you guys think I should apply anyway to those internships as backup, or just wait as the full-time process goes through?

I took this to mean F(4)/S(1) which I wrote as (1-F(4))/S(1) but this is not correct. Apparently *_3_*q*_1_*=1-(S(4)/S(1)). Does anyone have any sources of notes that explains this type of notation, or would anyone be willing to explain it to me?

[MFE] Can someone elaborate on the ASM manual answer on why projected stock prices being skewed to the right is NOT a weakness of the lognormal model?,6,1,False,False,False,actuary,1505508457,True,"The question states:

14. Which of statements (A)—(D) is not a weakness of the lognormal model for stock prices?

(A) Volatility is constant.

(B) Large stock movements do not occur.

(C) Projected stock prices are skewed to the right.

(D) Stock returns are not correlated over time.

(F) (A)—(D) are all weaknesses.

The answer key simply states, ""(C) is not a weakness, since one would expect that the multiplicative change in stock price, rather than the additive change, is symmetric""

I'm just not following at all what he means here. I know that stock prices are lognormally distributed and I know that a lognormal distribution is skewed right. But how do we know that that isn't a weakness?"

Half way through college and wanting to get started on my actuarial science career.,3,1,False,False,False,actuary,1505530347,True,"Hey this is a super noobie question and I'm a bit overwhelmed.

I had planned to go into actuarial science when I graduated, but from doing some research it seems that it's ideal to put serious effort into the actual exams while going through college.

Does anyone have any clear cut advice of what I should be doing/where I should start/if I should start right now?? What should I be studying, and when should I be planning to take my first exam with all this in mind?

Thinking about taking SAS certification exam,15,1,False,False,False,actuary,1505591375,True,"I'm an actuarial student looking for my first full time job in the field. Despite having two exams under my belt I've been having a hard time finding a job. I believe this is mostly due to my lack of experience (never took and internship in college, only started studying for exams after graduation.) 

I'm considering taking a SAS certificate exam to help myself stand out from the crowd and give tangible evidence that I can use data analysis software. I do have some background in SAS from college courses and am moderately comfortable using the program, but I could use a brush-up. 

I wanted to reach out to the community and see if anyone else has received one of these certifications and if they found it helpful in their career. I've started working toward MFE, so I probably don't want to do a complete about-face and focus on a totally different exam. However, if it will improve my chances of getting hired and is a relatively easy exam that I could pass quickly I think it might be worth considering.

TL;DR: How useful is a SAS certification pedigree going forward as an actuary?"

I am an aspiring actuary who's feeling discourages after attending yesterday's ASNY career fair.

Quick run-down of my stats:
US Citizen (Born here)
Top 20 university (Based on US News rankings)
3.9 GPA
5 exams with all 10s (P, FM, MFE, C, MLC). First exam passed on March 2016 and last exam passed on June 2017.
Have coursework for all VEEs
Lots of activities and leadership roles in college clubs
2360 SAT Score (780 R, 800 M, 780 W)

I've been applying for a year now, and I haven't even gotten a single response yet from recruiters.
I went to ASNY yesterday, because I felt it would be my only chance to get some 1-on-1 with company reps instead of firing my resumes into the black hole known as company career portals.

Needless to say, I could not believe how many people I was up against.
It's comforting to know that I wasn't alone in my struggles, but I can't shake the feeling that I'll never find an actuarial job.

Company I've been interviewing with just told me I should expect a full job offer this Friday.  Trying to evaluate this role vs my current role.

**My background:** FSA with pricing and valuation experience.  Current role I lead pricing and product development for about 1 new product per year, plus a bunch of other ad hoc work.  I think I'm overworked a bit IMO and a little underpaid - as per post history.  Also, my ownership of managing product lines hasn't truly grown, I get moved off of old products to lead work on new ones, no anticipated change in future types of work.

**New role:** The role would be a product management director with a top health carrier for a new line of products I have direct experience with from a product development level.  

**But:** My manager would not be an actuary and being an actuary was not part of the requirements.  I am basically an actuary in addition to being a product expert, but it's for 3 new product lines which I would manage going forward. **However:** I think this could provide value with commercial pricing bids, management of an in force block, and in the product filing process.  I've talked about my expertise in these areas and the hiring manager is definitely interested in that part of my background, and his manager has stated that I would definitely grow with the business, and on to other types of work too and manage the business in general.

So I just wanted stop by here and ask how I would go from my current position to being an Actuary? In my head it could go one of the following ways, but I'd love to know which is most accurate:

1. Apply to Actuary job or internship while in my current role, and then if I were to be accepted start studying for my first exam once I start working there?

2. Study for my first exam while in my current position, pass the exam, and then start apply for job or internship. After starting there I continue going through the next exams? 

3. Go and get Actuary specific education before beginning to take exams or look for positions? (It appears from my Google searches that this is not needed, but figured I'd double check that with this community) 

Those are the basic questions I have concerning what planning for this career change (or I guess career advancement since I'm just in an entry level job) would look like. I just want to get a better idea of what it takes to get into Actuary based on where I'm currently at. 

Thanks in advance for your time and assistance. 

Also, I should make a note that I am not positive what I want next in my career, I just figured I'd start doing my research on what careers may fir me going forward. Actuary just so happens to be one of those careers I'd like to learn more about in this planning process.

To whomever it may concern,

I am writing this letter to express my interest in the Health and Benefits Analyst position at XYZ Insurance in New York, NY. Attached within this application is my resume for your information.

I believe that would be an excellent candidate for this position. I am currently a senior in college at SUNY Binghamton pursuing a Bachelor’s of Arts in Actuarial Science, and I have a 3.79 cumulative GPA through six semesters, achieving Dean’s List in every one of them. Moreover, I have completed two SOA/CAS exams, and I am currently studying to pass a third before I graduate in May 2018. I have worked previously as an Actuarial Intern, and during that time I worked extensively with Microsoft Excel.

I am a hard-working person who loves both solving problems and going above and beyond what is asked of me. I consider myself to be a quick learner and I am always open to constructive criticism and/or advice. I am enthusiastic about working as an Actuary and I hope that I can one day bring that enthusiasm to XYZ Insurance.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward from hearing back from you. Please feel free to contact me anytime at (123) 456-7890 or email me at email@gmail.com. 

Kind Regards,

I received an offer this week and eventually leveraged it to get an offer from my current internship place. However, due to bad timing for everyone, I am only getting the details of the 2nd offer on Monday.

My problem is that I have not enough information about the new company to tell whether or not I should jump ships. I am expecting my current company to make me an offer slightly lower than the other place just by using my current salary as an indicator, but I could be completely wrong. The current company is great really, I get along with everyone and it's a nice place to work at. The only thing is that it's a bit lacking on the social side.

On the other hand, I have no clue how the other company is. I tried asking some people about it, but they always give me extremely politically correct answers.. However, it does sound like it will be much more social over there. What worries me is that the position is also open to people with an Administration background and does not require you to pursue exams if you don't want to. Though, most people still pursue them apparently. So maybe I'm overthinking it, but I don't wanna get stuck in this new position as a simple analyst and have to jump ship again a year from now.

The reason why I'm posting now is that the day I receive the full offer will also be the day I have to make a decision..

Any advice is appreciated!"

Salary Ceiling for an Actuary.,26,1,False,False,False,actuary,1506342881,True,"Actuary is regarded as one of the best and among the Highest paid professions. (Or so ive heard/read). However people link Actuarial Salary to exams. As long as Exam progression is there, the salary growth is there. What happens once exam Ends? From what ive read i have gotten the idea (might be wrong) that Actuary have a Ceiling of about $150-$200K. 

Comparing them to other professions such as Auditors/CPA, Lawyer, Management Consultants etc... they dont have that sort of a Ceiling. Auditors/CPA can sometimes start low but can make a LOT in the long run. Lawyers can potentially make MUCH more in the long run. MBB Consultants have very good exit opportunities and have great Compensation packages as well.

Actuary sounds like a good profession for the Early stage of your career when you can progress fast on the basis of your exams however in the long term Actuary doesnt sound as good cause of the Ceiling? Why is that. Please do let me know if im wrong. Would love to clear that misconception. (Hoping There is Big Money for an Actuary in the long term for All of us &lt;3)

While I definitely enjoyed my actuarial internship last summer a ton, I am still curious about other professions and am left scratching my head that so many people my age act like they know exactly what they want to do.

More specifically, I have noticed that there are a lot of trading internships that seem really cool, and to me it seems like there is a lot of similarities in skills between actuaries and traders. For example, both are usually good with probability, risk management, and maybe some level of predictive modelling.

So I couldn't help but wonder, did anyone here ever consider being a trader? Or maybe was a trader before? How did you become an actuary?

To me it seems that the advantages of trading is that there is more money there, the work may be more exciting, and trading firms seem to be more modern in their use of technology. The downsides seem to be long hours, a much riskier career trajectory (no clear ladder/high chance of getting fired), and sometimes nastier work cultures.

Thinking about the above has me leaning towards being an actuary since I'm not sure I want to work insane hours, and I've really liked every actuary I've met. But I just wanted to see if anyone here had any other insights!

I spent a month of summer preparing for Exam P by doing the online Sample Exams that SOA offers online but I failed it today. I am a fourth year student at UCSB with a 2.8 GPA (Financial Math and Stats Major) and no internship experience. I partied too much during my first two years of college but I have outgrown it and am now stressing about when I graduate. I am aware I need to pass a few tests to even get a shot at interning when I graduate. I am taking three upper division math classes this upcoming quarter but I feel that I need to study for Exam P during the quarter before I forget everything. I intend on retaking Exam P in January. Do you guys have any advice for me?"

I was hoping some people could look over my resume and give me their opinion. I know it looks really empty (I previously brought my concerns to this sub here: https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/712t2a/i_have_a_pretty_empty_resume_is_there_anything/) but I have no real work experience, extracurriculars, or volunteering to put down.

One question I do have is whether or not I should put down that I am planning to sit Exam MFE during the 2017-2018 academic year, even though I don't know if I'll be taking it in November or March?

Also, should I put the exact dates that I took Exams P and FM? Would the complete dates look nicer?

Can we make an overview of what the different actuarial teams in a P&amp;C insurance company do? Preferably for Ontario.,3,0,False,False,False,actuary,1506554201,True,"Correct what I have wrong or rewrite it entirely:

Personal lines pricing team:  
 - Use policy and claim data to create a pricing model, that comes out in the form of base rates and differentials, those are given to underwriters to that they can give quotes to customers  
 - Submit filings when there are rate changes. How do these filings work? Do they run their current policies in force through their new model, discover that they on average are raising their rates by 3%, and therefore submit a filing for a 3% rate change? How do rate changes actually work?

Commercial lines pricing team:  
 - same as above but with less data and more customization based on the needs of the client  
 - Is there an example somewhere of what a commercial lines pricing model looks like, with data?

Reserving team:  
 - book paid, unpaid, and IBNR claim data each month  
 - estimate how much cash the company needs to hold on hand so that they can pay out all their claims

Someone:  
 - Dynamic Capital Adequacy Testing  
 - Appointed Actuary report  

Are personal lines pricing models always in the form of coming up with base rates and differentials? And is the reason for that because it gives underwriters and brokers a way to quote prices to customers?"

General Advice For Going Forward,38,0,False,False,False,actuary,1506707811,True,"Hello. I am currently a senior in college majoring in mathematics with the goal of pursuing a career in the actuarial science field. Basically what I want advice on is the timing in which I should take my exams.

My current plan: I am currently taking 13 credits (quite demanding courses however) as well as studying for the P independently using Actex. I am also taking a current class that teaches the material of the FM exam. I plan on taking the P exam in November, followed by (assuming I passed P) the FM exam in january at the tail end of my winter break.

My problem: So, I decided very late that I wanted to pursue actuarial science and therefore I am a little pressed for time which is why I am trying to fit in 2 exams by the time of my final semester at college so I will be a more competitive candidate by the time i graduate. My GPA (2.7) is lower than the standard by quite a decent amount which already makes landing a job/internship quite difficult. I did slack off in college the first two years but have really busted my ass to get my life together since then. I have brought the GPA up significantly and have made active decisions towards furthering my career. I am in the right mindset, I'm just very nervous about my academic history. I was involved in Greek Life at my school and was elected the executive president for this school year. I think that makes my resume stand out a little bit, but I know that GPA is a real killer and so is the fact that I have never had an internship. I was never able to land one over my time at school, so every summer I was a landscaper, becoming the assistant manager of the company (very small - family owned) my last summer. So, I am trying to have 2 exams done by January to show possible employers that I do have my shit together and I'm taking the right steps in the right direction and that maybe I'm worth a shot. The problem with this is my courseload is already quite intense and to be frank I have not been able to study as much as I would like to for my P exam. 

So what I would like advice on is whether or not I should postpone my P exam, so I have a better chance of passing the first time. I would shoot for January again as that will give me plenty of time over winter break to prepare and then plan to take FM in the summer so I at least can put one exam on my resume. What do you think? Thank you in advance for your advice and I am very sorry this was a novel.

Tl:dr;

Don't feel like I have enough time to prepare for P to the point where I can confidently take the exam and pass without too much trouble, so should I postpone P to January in order to have a better chance at passing. Want to put as many exams as possible on my resume to make up for my GPA."

"[MFE] Clarification needed on short selling, haircut/collateral and the explanation in the ASM manual.",3,1,False,False,False,actuary,1506779695,True,"[I am working on this practice exam problem.](https://imgur.com/a/zqf3m)

[Here is the solution.](https://imgur.com/a/w58Ch)

[This is the author's explanation about short selling.](https://imgur.com/a/23JmF)

My understanding from this paragraph is that collateral is greater than the stock price, with the extra amount being the haircut, and so the collateral would be 3000 + 600 = 3600, which you give to the lender at T = 0 to borrow the stock. The 3600 accumulates at 2% and so at Time 1, you'd pay 2700, give back the stock, and receive 3600(1.02) = 3672 from the lender, for a profit of 972.

I don't understand where the -600*1.04 comes from because I don't know what investment the author is referring to. I thought that's already taken care of with the collateral accumulating at 2%? In the author's solution, it seems like you're gaining interest twice on the 600 haircut."

I returned to uni but was still unhappy and decided to leave permanently after successfully completing second year. This means I have a Diploma in Higher Education in economics.

Life Reinsurance: Coinsurance vs YRT,0,1,False,False,False,actuary,1506787483,True,"Hi everyone,

I have a question about the different types of life reinsurance. I get the fundamental differences between the two, and i've been trying to find each of their common uses. This is what i've found:



YRT

-Mainly used for reinsuring traditional WL products, Accidental death benefits, term life insurance riders


Coinsurance

-Reinsurance for any type of insurance (life, disability, medical, etc)

-Term products which have little or no cash value buildup



Im just asking for an explanation with regards to why each would be used for a block of business vs the other. Trying to understand the advantages and disadvantages for each. For example, would UL products be more under coinsurance treaties since the lapse risk is covered by it (whereas only mortality/morbidity is covered by YRT)

But I am confused as to what the difference would be in the work that a P&amp;C actuary does and what a data scientist does. If you ignore the rate filings and regulations, isn't the actuary using the same tools (R/Python) to analyze data and come up with risk?

When I look at salaries of people in my school, the data scientists get paid more than the actuaries, and I'm presuming this will go on after graduation as well. So, actuaries have to pass exams, they get paid less than data scientist (at least at my school) and do similar work. would it be better to become a data scientist?

As for my passions, they lie at the intersection of statistics, finance and CS (a little less towards CS). "
The Dilemma of Getting Too Far,31,9,False,False,False,actuary,1506992189,True,"So I have an unusual problem. I'm an incurable overachiever/perfectionist and graduated college with all five prelims and two internships under my belt. I've been working full-time at a life company for over three months, and I can't help but feeling dread every single day. Here I am, on the fast-track to being a qualified professional in a field I don't think I'm actually interested in. The fact that the SOA is saying ""get your ASA soon or take an extra exam"" isn't helping at all. So now I'm buried in modules, desperately trying to maintain happiness and energy as I flip through the driest educational slides I've ever read.

Actuaries are concise--and I'm rather not--but I'll get to the point. Is there anything else I can do with this exam experience? Or do you know of anyone who switched careers to take on a more technical engineering-type role? I bang my head against the wall every single day for not pursuing software engineering or something in the same vein. 17-year-old me didn't know what I know now I guess. I love solving technical problems, but I don't want to be constrained to solving insurance problems for the rest of my life. The thought of writing memos about model governance and assumptions makes me a little sick, frankly.

Truth be told, I started studying for this a little bit late as I was busy with another project until recently. I'm planning on finishing the ASM manual and the accompanying SOA notes on interest rate swaps, etc. by next Thursday, which would give me a week of just doing the 200 SOA practice problems and Adapt. Is that enough time or would you guys recommend that I rush through the ASM manual so that I have two weeks of just doing problems? 

The reason I'm going through the manual a bit slowly is that I'm doing all the accompanying end-of-chapter problems and making sure I completely understand all the material. I am confident in the material I've covered in the manual thus far (I've gone through roughly half the manual), so I feel as though my pace has been helpful in that regard. Since FM is my first exam, I'm just a bit stressed out at this moment, so I guess, more than anything else, I'm looking for some reassurance from people who've been there before.

Actuarial work and overview,7,1,False,False,False,actuary,1507050541,True,I have an actuarial career fair this friday and I'm looking for an entry level job upon graduation this May. I know the basics of what a Consulting and Insurance actuary does but don't really know the roles in details or anything.

Career Changing--Will I be competitive enough?,10,1,False,False,False,actuary,1507052037,True,"Planning a career change from teaching high school math.  I passed P last summer and am hoping to pass FM in December and begin applying for jobs during the current school year, and hopefully begin working an actuary job by next fall.  Ideally, I would like to wrap up this school year before quitting my job.  What worries me, though, is that with this timeline, I will be competing with everyone who graduated in the spring.  

Will I be competitive enough as a 26 year old to go up against recent grads like this, or will I really need to try to apply during an off-season (if that exists) instead?  If it matters, I have a Math bachelor degree from a good University with a solid 3.5 GPA but no finance experience whatsoever.  

Related questions: Are two exams enough for an EL career changer?  Do I need 3+ to make myself stand out from the crowd of younger candidates?  I was told somewhere (maybe here) that I don't need to do any sort of internship.  Does that seem right considering my lack of finance experience, though?

Career change from experimental physics (academic tenure track) to actuarial science?,12,2,False,False,False,actuary,1507053497,True,"Does anyone have experience leaving academia to be an actuary?

I am being paid little money to do what is essentially 5 different jobs and thinking of a change.

In general I would like to ask if there are there others who have made this switch who can tell me about the experience?  How hard/easy was it to find an actuarial job with this sort of background?

More specifically I have a ton of questions:
How much studying is required for someone with my background (strong math, stats, programming, problem solving)? And how does this end up affecting work/life balance?  What is the total number of work hours per week I can expect (e.g. a range or average) including studying in the first several years?  Would this kind of move actually lead to a less stressful career that still incorporates problem solving skills day to day?

"[UK] - Advice please, not a newbie at this.",2,2,False,False,False,actuary,1507054011,True,"Hello

I'm looking for some general career advice and advice on which exams I should do before the curriculum changes. I started working in September 2012 straight from A levels.  I'll set the scene by setting out my exam history:


* April 2014 - CT1: P
* April 2015 - CT2: P
* September 2015 - CT3: F 
* April 2016 - CT3: F, CT4: F, CT6: F
* September 2016 - CT3: F, CT7: F
* April 2017 - CT3: P
* September 2017 - CA2 &amp; CT5


Some notes - initially I wasn't allowed to take more than one exam at a time by my employer hence the gaps at the start.. 


For September 2017 - I think CA2 went OK.  CT5 felt awful, I was ready but in the exam I panicked and forgot a load of simple formulae :(


So now I'm in a dilemna of what to do before the curriculum changes.  I work in the pensions sector where we don't use R language at all so I would prefer to not have to do it but it's looking likely that I'm going to have to do something with R.


The 18 months of fails also aligned with when I was going through some bad mental health patch and was on anti depressants which severely affected my memory I believe, along with being extremely stressed at work.  But now that period has knocked my confidence completely and this sitting I put myself under so much pressure because I **need** to get CT5 that I was unproductive as the exam neared.


I'm now at the stage with my employer where I will soon have to start paying for my own exams if I don't pass anything next sitting (April 2018). Also, next sitting if I sit two exams I will have to use some holiday for study days.  I have not felt particularly supported by my employer and I've been made aware that there are better study packages out there.. It's starting to leave a bit of a stale taste in my mouth and I'm contemplating looking for a different job, career or just taking a break from work.


I'm thinking next sitting do either CT5 &amp; CT6, then CT4 &amp; CT8 in September which will mean I avoid R completely under the new curriculum, on the big assumption I pass everything.  Or CT5 &amp; CT7, then CT8 &amp; CP3 in September with the hopes that R isn't too bad for the new CT4 &amp; CT6 combo and technically less time spent in exams..


Thanks for reading, what would you do in my shoes?"

"Posted here a couple times regarding various topics, need some insight as to whether it is worth it for me to pursue this career.",14,0,False,False,False,actuary,1507250770,True,"Straight to the point:

I'm a Junior, major Econ, minor Applied Stats, no exams taken thus none passed, took a Theory of Interest class (prep for exam FM) got a C. Took an Actuarial Statistics class (prep for P), got a C. GPA 3.3 (will go up since I got my shit together now, Fresh and Soph years were a mess), and currently applying to all sorts of internships, actuarial or not. 

I like statistics more than math, and hate studying (I don't think anyone enjoys studying anyway), but I absolutely love working with others and the idea of conducting professional projects and communicating with clients and team members appeals to me more than just sitting in a cubicle working on models and math from 9-5 every day. 

The various careers I've been looking at are Data Analytics, Actuary, Investment Banking, and Financial Consulting. 

I know IB is the more rewarding one, but I'm shying away from that because working 70+ hours a week while being married and having a kid doesn't appeal to me. If I wasn't family-oriented then I'd go for IB without question. BUt i want to enjoy my early years of marriage and twenties/thirties.

Anyway, I was wondering if the time and investment in taking the preliminary exams and so on is worth it, if I am not CRAZY about math, but more about statistics. Turns out actuaries don't make as much as I had thought, and I know it varies. Data analysts, actuaries, and those going into consulting all start off the same. I did look at the salary figures for actuaries in the FAQ, and even then it seemed a bit low for me. Again, I am willing to work hard, but my idea of work isn't sitting and studying for hours and hours on end; it is actual professional work that I can profit off of. Reason I am even considering Actuary is because it seems to be a secure and good job to have. Low-stress once exams are over, and an enjoyable, safe career once it gets rolling. I do think insurance is interesting to work with as well, whether its life, p and c or health.

I personally just want to do something with business analysis, statistics, data, and overall business dealing. I also want a decent salary out of college (I guess 50-60K isn't terrible) but would like for it to grow to a nice six figures after 10 years or hopefully less. I don't want a Maserati or mansion; I just want enough money to be comfortable and not worry about any accidental expenses or school loans.

EDIT: Maybe not totally related, but I am discussing this with my friend and he believes I am undervaluing money and stressing too much on salary. Maybe he's right, but shit's expensive in the States. I don't know."

Should I switch into actuarial science? Too late?,14,2,False,False,False,actuary,1507266152,True,"Hi all.

I am a sophomore in college and am currently undecided. I was thinking about double majoring in mathematics and political economy, but a career in actuarial science has always been in the back of my mind.

I love statistics and discrete mathematics, but I feel like it might be too late to start?

I regret dismissing actuarial science as a career in high school, but now it is becoming more attractive to me. Specifically, I like the idea of a real career path (which is not present in political economy) and the high pay, low-stress, etc. Not to mention I love math, specifically statistics.

My problem is that I would like to find an internship for this summer to see if this is something I would like to further pursue. However, I have not taken an exam yet. I do not even know how I would go about registering or studying for one. Does anyone have any advice?

I would like to try and take at least the P exam before the summer, but I do not think I would not know if I passed or not by the time applying to internships starts to heat up? I'm just not sure what to do.

Some info if this helps: I've taken Calc I, II, and III, and am currently taking a probability course, which I think has similar concepts to the P exam (which is obviously much harder than my class lol). Will I have enough time to study for an exam administered in the late winter? early spring?

Is this a viable path for someone like me? What can I do to try and secure an internship in this field if I have absolutely no experience in this area? I've had internships before, but nothing related to actuarial science.

[UK] Exam order advice: CA1 or SA3?,2,1,False,False,False,actuary,1507275966,True,"Yes, It's that time of year again! Any advice on what exam to sit next is really welcome:

- Passed: CT1-9 and ST8.
- Just sat ST7.
- So remaining: CA1, CA2, CA3, and SA3.
(Plus a potential ST7 resit).

(Failed CA1 twice after my CTs by 2% and 1% so I said fuck it for a bit and sat ST8 and ST7 in 2017).

My question is: Should I plan to sit SA3 next? Then CA1 in September 2018? That's what I'm inclined to do, because apparently SA3 follows very closely on from ST7 and ST8(?).

Or should I try and get CA1 under my belt before the syllabus changes? The long sitting doesn't really affect me massively as I didn't fail CA1 for not starting early enough tbh.

Also: I've always done badly combining many exams (3 CTs or 2 STs) so I'm generally averse to tackling CA2 and CA3 until I've done the written exams. That's likely to be in 2019 when they are the new syllabus. Is this a bad idea? Should I just do CA2/3 whilst I can (combined with SA3 / CA1)?

Needless to say, I'm extremely nervous. I was wondering if anyone on this sub has gone through this process and, if so, if they'll be able to give me advice on what to expect and how to best prepare. I'm also open to any advice in general.

Thank you in advance to everyone."

Fuck MLC,24,9,False,False,False,actuary,1507439340,True,"Just need to vent. I passed the first 4 prelims on the first try and failed MLC last sitting with a 5. This exam sucks and they make it way more difficult than it needs to be. 

They just keep making the exams harder each time. I took the Fall 2014 practice exam for example and the MC's were so freaking easy, I breezed through them and got 19/20. When I took the actual exam Spring 2017, the MC's were so damn hard and the WA were not any easier than other sittings either. How is it fair for them to not keep the difficultly anywhere near consistent? 

Why does the pass rate for MLC have to be in the 30's while other exams in the 40's to 50's?  

Seriously screw the MLC exam. The material is interesting and I like it but the actual exam is making me hate all of it. They don't need to make the exam THAT difficult. It's not going to make or break one's career as an actuary. I really don't know what the SOA is thinking.

I have been studying hard for this upcoming exam. I am trying my best to understand the concepts on a deeper level and practicing doing the WA quickly but efficiently. There are a lot of calculations involved in the WA answer and many decimals. It's so easy to make a mistake. 

If I fail this upcoming sitting too, I really don't know what else to do. I feel like I am reaching the point where I can't improve much on what I know. They can simply ask questions that I cannot solve under the time pressure no matter how well I know the material.

Good luck to everyone taking MLC. I really feel like this is the most unfair of all of the preliminary exams so far.

Edit: A lot of people are misinterpreting what I mean by unfair, I apologize for being unclear. 

By unfair, I mean they do not need to make the exam so difficult that the usual pass rate is in the mid 30's. A more fair exam IMO is where 40-50% of the candidates are able to pass consistently. There is nothing special about MLC in particular for them to make it this difficult compared to the other preliminaries."

[UK] Best way to get into an actuary trainee role in London,5,2,False,False,False,actuary,1507487995,True,"Hi all, 

I am a mechanical engineer thinking about changing career to actuary.

I graduated last year with a MEng in Mechanical Engineering from an okay university.

I’ve quickly realised there is almost no theory that I’ve learnt at uni from my degree being applied in the real world engineering environment. Feeling disillusioned!

Studying for exams is something that I quite enjoyed and I consider myself as strong mathematically.

A question I have is what’s the best way to get into an Actuarial Trainee role? Preferably in London.

From searching the sub, I see differing ideas. Some say passing the easier CT exams (1 &amp; 3 I believe) gives my CV weight and is essential. Others argue I would be better off learning R or Python. Another group will argue there’s no point in learning anything in advance and I should grab a job semi-relevant to actuary (even an office job).

What’s the consensus r/actuary?

I need some help understanding the Geometric Brownian Motion.,2,11,False,False,False,actuary,1507492843,True,"Hello,
In university I am getting courses in which the Geometric Brownian Motion is becoming an increasingly important concept, and I'm having trouble to understand some things about this process (even though I've spent quite some time trying to figure it out). I will use one of our most recent assignments to clarify some of the points that I don't understand, and hopefully someone can help me to understand the GBM better.

We are working with monthly market returns since 1926, as can be obtained via the Fama-French data library. First we compute logarithmic returns from the arithmetic returns, and their monthly mean and standard deviation, because the GBM works with log-returns. Next, we solve the SDE dSt/St= µdt + σdW(t) through the use of Ito's Lemma to find that the mean of the monthly log returns = µ - σ²/2. Next, we are told that the logarithmic returns that we computed at the start are normally distributed with mean = (µ - σ²/2)t and variance = σ²t. Here already, I'm finding it hard to see what we need the drift µ = m + σ²/2 for.

Next, we have to compute the value at risk, using the fact that the logreturns follow a geometric brownian motion. Here also, I wonder why we can't just use m, the mean of the logreturns we computed, without having to use the drift µ, because my formula for the VaR is https://imgur.com/a/TFKOC , in which I don't see why we can't just use m, as m = (µ - σ²/2) as far as I'm concerned.

We also have to simulate GBM's, which I do as follows in Python: https://imgur.com/a/D31IS. Here also, I'm not sure if I should use the drift µ = m + σ²/2 or the mean m = (µ - σ²/2)t as the mean of my random normal increments, and why. The last thing I'm wondering about is the fact that the logreturns that I originally computed are monthly, and that this simulation is supposed to be for a 10-day VaR. Shouldn't I have started with daily logreturns in that case? And what are the implications for the standard deviation when simulating GBM's for 10 days, depending on whether we use monthly or daily data?

Thank you in advance for any help I get on this topic!"

What are my prospects if I do not intend to pursue a fellowship?,9,2,False,False,False,actuary,1507514157,True,"About to graduate in December. Failed exam FM after realizing just days before the exam that the curriculum had changed and was using an outdated study guide (this was in August).

The main turnoff for me is that I'm nearly 30 and do not want to spend my remaining youthful years studying for the exams. If it were limited to the prelims I would not dread it. In fact, I kind of like studying for them.

[UPDATE] Job Scope Too Large?,0,9,False,False,False,actuary,1507555003,True,"This is an update to a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6vmbkd/job_description_too_large/?st=j8k69ahq&amp;sh=b2dd1370).  I would **greatly** appreciate any guidance or feedback or thoughts on my specific situation...I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this stuff with.

**TLDR version:** these last two quarters have been a tough work schedule (50-55 hours/wk) caused in part by the fact that (A) I am a new FSA that doesn't have any staff and (B) my job responsibilities are basically both product manager and pricing actuary.  I've also kind of reasoned that my manager and my peers (who are also managers) are not great managers but have a ton of experience and one is a bona fide workaholic.  I am still feeling burnout at times from working 9-10 hours and then occasionally from home or on Sundays, while still being paid a bit below average IMO for an FSA.

However, I really do like my manager's manager (company president) and have positive relationships with many of the other senior executives here.  

**Update #1:** I suppose management changed their mind as my boss offered me a direct report to start sometime in 2018.  This is exciting because I feel I could focus on higher level work, leverage an analyst's work to build out a lot of great new projects, and get experience as a manager within the company.  I am also getting more exposure to senior management as well in the last month, so that is good.  

**The catch is** they haven't explicitly mentioned a promotion or a major change to my work responsibilities.  (My manager and I never really facilitate forward looking discussions, just on what work is over the next 3-6 months.)   Also, I am concerned this person will be assigned work from other people's teams.
Finally, I might not get a new hire until May 2018, since we're starting from square one on recruitment and there's another open position on another team that would have preference for an immediate start date (since it needs to be filled).  So I might be stuck still without any help regardless until mid next year.

**Update #2:**  I applied for a product management role with a competitor firm.  I have been hinted that they may extend an offer soon, which I had planned to accept if it increased my total comp by 25% or more.  However, this is a big change for me that I am concerned is too motivated by money and short term issues.  It would be 70% remote with 30% travel, and I would be starting from square one in terms of network.  It's also less actuarial/financial and more marketing/product management.

**Based on update #1, should I drop myself from the running from the new job, or wait and see if they offer me?**  We've started recruiting for my new role, before having it finally approved because of the multiple roles available.  **Also, should I have more conversation my manager about my role, progress, leaning in to promotion?**  "

Jobs outside of core actuarial departments in insurance.,4,1,False,False,False,actuary,1507571809,True,"Hey everyone,

I'm coming up on 7 years of doing the actuarial thing, and am trying to figure out my career path from here. I'm at the point where my company expects me to be in a position that I'm willing to stay in for 3-5 years. Before this, they encouraged us to move every 1.5-2.5 years so we could see all the different areas.

I've done 5 years of Reserving-ish work and 2 years of pricing, and while I haven't hated the jobs I've had, I've never really had a day where I'm super excited to go to work.


The things I love about the job are:

Analyzing the data/figures to find issues/trends

Digging into said data to explain said issues/trends

Making sense of technical things to non-technical people

Teaching people stuff (Almost went to school for teaching)


The things I don't like about the job:

The end product (picking a loss ratio or setting a price)


I enjoy everything leading up to the end product, but get so deflated/unmotivated when I think about what it's all for. It's not like I'm surprised that this is what the job is, but I think it just finally caught up to me how it doesn't get me excited to come into work and motivated to do a good job. I'm not getting that ""feeling fulfilled"" thing...

So yeah, I'm trying to think of jobs within the company that use the same sort of core skills of an actuary, but have their final product be something other than a number on the P&amp;L. I would like to work closer with the customer, or do something that directly impacts the customer (other than setting the price). Also, I really enjoy working with people. I don't want to sit in a cube by myself all day.

I'm not opposed to going outside of insurance, but want to explore all my options within it before looking elsewhere. Also, I work for a very big company, so they'll most likely have whatever role you're thinking of.

Appreciate all the suggestions/help!

TLDR: Any job in the insurance world that uses the same core skills of an actuary, but that has a responsibility other than a line on a P&amp;L or setting the price of insurance?"

What to do once Exam P/FM are passed?,2,3,False,False,False,actuary,1507617174,True,"Hello r/actuary,

I'm aware nothing is a done-deal in this field. I passed Exam P in May and am currently in the process of trying to pass FM (failed with a 4 in August, going for a second try late next week). As a college junior, I am also currently searching for an internship, and I am receiving some interest so I just need to work on my interview skills and I should be okay there.

But what I'm wondering about is this: Once Exam FM is passed, whether it be next week, in December or whenever... I'm not sure what to do for my third exam... Normally, if it were any other year, I would just go ahead and start studying for MFE after a little break when my semester schedule is allowing it... but the problem is, the whole exam system is being overhauled next July. P and FM are essentially staying the same... but the rest of the exams seem to be changing. I understand that the old exams transfer their credit... but it took me two attempts to pass Exam P, at least two attempts to pass FM and I'm not expecting to nail my third exam, which is supposed to be much more difficult, on my first try (though I suppose it's possible since I'm learning what works best in terms of self-study habits in the process, but I just don't want to get overconfident).

What's wrong with that? Well, I'll be able to attempt MFE in March... and that's it. If I fail in March, I'll have to essentially study for a brand new exam for the following July, as if the study time for MFE went to waste.

So when I pass FM, what should I do? Should I just relax and focus on other things and wait until the exam changes? Should I try to study for MFE and give it a shot in March? Or should I try to study for C (a little strange for the third exam, I know) since I could potentially get two shots at it in February and June?"

I often read on this forum that there are far better opportunities in software dev than in actuarial, in Canada, for reasonably smart people with analytical skills.

According to the DW Simspson survey ( https://www.dwsimpson.com/downloads/...ge-HANDOUT.pdf ), the estimated average total comp for a general insurance/casualty actuarial professional in Canada is about $130K, for about 10 years of experience.

Maybe I don't look at the right sources but I don't see anything close to that for software professionals with the same kind of educational background and experience.

Maybe i'm looking at the wrong numbers (I looked at payscale).
Maybe average comp doesn't make much sense for this ? What am I missing ?
Maybe it's the sheer difficulty of breaking into the profession as a non-actuarial student that makes software dev a more reasonable choice ? I'm thinking that maybe I'm just not looking at the right compensation numbers for software dev."

The r/actuary Effect?,10,74,False,False,False,actuary,1507883311,True,"People often ask: Why do you want to be an actuary?

For me, it's because of r/actuary. WARNING: Apologies for the long emotional post.

2 years ago I fell deep in severe depression. Didn't do anything with my days besides eat and try to find a reason to see another day. Food and alcohol were my only sources of happiness. I quit my part-time work, I dropped out of school, and I had no plans of the future. Every bit of my identity was wrapped up in impostor syndrome, believing I was never cut out to do the things expected of me. I had no intentions of seeing a career for myself.

12 months ago, I found myself still shutting myself in, away from the real world, playing video games and my social interaction was from joining online communities: discord, reddit, etc. I'd pretend I was unavailable IRL if anyone wanted something from me. But the truth was, I was just too afraid to face reality. I'd go weeks without leaving my room. Not sure how I survived.

6 months ago, the relationship between me and my parents got a little less rocky. Because of it, I thought I could try again at everything I gave up on. Shortly, I fell even deeper and harder into depression. After trying and failing harder at being an active, productive person, it certainly took a toll on my emotional and mental health. I thought that was my final push, and that I had failed miserably.

Over the past 6 months of ups and downs, I've been lurking r/actuary. As I read posts and comments here, the actuarial career really started sounding like a good fit for my interests. I learned about the exam process, and although I knew it was a long way away from where I was in my life, I figured I owed you guys an honest attempt at it. I decided to sign up for Exam P and give it my all.

In July I managed to pass P. I had an internship interview last week. I'm actually going back to school next semester, and I'm starting to believe I can finish my degree. I joined my school's actuary club and met some amazing people already, chipping away at my recent anti-social tendencies. Today I passed FM. Next up, MFE in November. My entire lifestyle is built around a newfound confidence and sense of self-fulfillment.

None of this would've happened if I hadn't found comfort checking reddit and reading discussion and debates here. The community here was so open and welcoming. You could've easily focused on your own self-improvement but instead decide to take the time to explain pathways and concepts, and even answering silly trivial questions from newbies. That gave me hope and reason to try my best to continue it forward, and better myself so I can one day help others as well. You guys made such an impact on my life, and so I really want to say thanks.

I love you all so much. Best of luck to all of you out there grinding and bettering yourselves as actuaries or simply as a person. Remember that people really do care about you and want to see you succeed."

And then how do we know that the relationship between \sigma and \sigma_n is \sigma_n = \sigma / sqrt(n).

I know that volatility is proportional to time, so we use \sigma \sqrt(t) in a lot of calculation, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. "
Why Hedge EIA,1,2,False,False,False,actuary,1507905590,True,"Studying for Life Pricing Exam.


Basic concept for EIA is fixed annuity + call option. Call option supports the interest credited due to index growth. The simple call option protects against higher-than-expected index growth. I don't understand the need for static/dynamic hedging. Study guide gives example of call-spread (static) and delta hedging (dynamic). 


Are there additional risks that the call option does not cover? Are theses strategies *in addition to* or an *alternative to* the simple call option?

Solution: Set up the following two equations in the two unknowns.

(1) 5000(1.03)^3 + B(1.03)^-b =  12,000

5463.635 + B(1.03)^-b = 12,000 =\&gt; B(1.03)^-b = 6536.365

Summer Plans: Please Help!,0,1,False,False,False,actuary,1508168588,True,[removed]
Summer plans; need help!!,6,3,False,False,False,actuary,1508168847,True,"Hey everyone!

So here's some background;
I am a junior Actuarial Science major at Temple University (Philadelphia, PA) (class of 2019)
I have a ~3.44 Cumulative GPA, and by May 2018, I will of taken P and FM
I have no Exams passed as of this post
I had an internship with a P&amp;C insurance company in their R&amp;D department under their actuaries in the summer of 2017

So I have a pretty big decision to make in the next few weeks. What do I do this summer? Do I return to my internship at the same company that I worked for last summer or do I go off and do another year of my traveling sports group?

So here's some more background:

I am a athlete as a hobby. In the summer of 2016, I traveled around the country practicing and competing in front of tens of thousands of people. I loved every second of it and it was my dream to do this since I was 14 (Currently 20). However, this wasn't free, and so instead of doing it again in 2017, I got an internship. I learned a lot in my internship and I enjoyed the experience, however, as the clock ticks down, I have to decide to go back to the internship or go back to the traveling athletic group. 

Here's the catch. I am 20, and the cut off for the music group is 21 years of age. That makes the 2018 season my last possible season to go do this again, and I can never re-enter after that. 

Is my one internship sufficient enough to keep a competitive edge in the current market? I understand that two is always better than on in the internship world, but is it awful that I could choose not to get two years?
I plan on passing P, FM, and MFE by my graduation, and I obviously do not plan on having my GPA drop anytime soon.

Is it career suicide to not take the 2nd internship and go compete again? If it's not suicide, what is it? Does it really matter? I'm not claiming to be knowledgeable in the industry, so please, educate me! I'm looking for wholesome feedback beyond ""get the 2nd internship"" please tell me **why**

Interview Format,15,4,False,False,False,actuary,1508191024,True,"Hey everyone. I recently had a full-time interview with a large P&amp;C company. This was only my second full-time interview, but the experience was so startling that I wanted to find out how common this is.

It was two separate 30 minute interviews, each with two interviewers. The first interview started with about 3 minutes of ""tell me about yourself"" stuff, but every minute from there onward in both interviews followed the same format. The interviewers would hand me a question on a piece of paper, sometimes analytical, sometimes behavioral, and essentially tell me to answer it, then ask one or two follow up questions from there. The analytical questions were nothing like anything I had ever done on an exam and almost felt like ""game"" questions, like I was trying to solve a riddle in front of them. Needless to say I feel very confidently I completely botched the analytical questions.

I have 2 exams and an internship, so I feel like a very qualified candidate. On top of that, I'm very personable and generally interview well. But after that interview, I feel like the company couldn't tell you a single thing about me personally. It felt like they just wanted to see if I could be a robot in their department, which is odd because they described the actuarial department as fun and social. So how common is this kind of interview format, and do I generally need to be preparing more for these ""game"" type questions?

Edit: The analytical questions involved forecasting product sales based on other past products and the other question was predicting applications and acceptance for an event based on past data."
Bad at math and want to become an actuary?,13,2,False,False,False,actuary,1508211880,True,"So I'm the type of person who needs a reason to do something--in high school I never paid attention in math b/c it was boring and tedious and I was slow at it.

Do I need an actuarial degree to be an actuary?,9,0,False,False,False,actuary,1508223294,True,"Here's the deal. I already have an undergraduate in Biology (Genetics) so it is not like I have no degree. I recently started a Math undergrad (Actuatial science option), but it seems like I might no longer receive any financial aid (I am maximizing on credits since it is my second undergrad) and that is a real bummer, as I won't be able to proceed with taking classes due to this. However, if I go off on my own and pass all the required exams, get one or two internships along the way, is it realistically possible to get a job as an actuary without actually finishing that specific degree? Does it severily diminish my chances in this career path without one? I have taken few economics classes, plenty math classes (might have earned a minor at this point really). Through years I've been very involved with math department (was a math club president, Calc TA, math tutor). I am driven enough to sit down and study the material on my own, as I have done that for most of my college career. So.. considering all this.. can I become an actuary without graduating with an actuarial degree?"

Help me choose my major(s)!,8,1,False,False,False,actuary,1508369510,True,"Hello all.

I've been toying with the idea of becoming an actuary for a while now. I'm leaning towards it. Currently, I am a Political Economy and Math double major. I'm losing interest in Political Economy, and am intrigued by becoming an actuary. I plan to take Exam P in January, as I am currently in a Probability Course and will study my butt off during Winter Break leading up to the exam. Here's the thing: I have already completed a business minor (a program where you can earn it in one summer, did it between Freshman and Sophomore year, am currently a Sophomore). Would it be worth it to add a Finance major or just stay as a Math Major. Switching to a Finance major would be very easy, because of the summer program I did, I have a lot of the Finance major requirements out of the way and I would still probably be able to graduate early.

So, I'm wondering, is it worth it to pick up the Finance Major?

tl;dr Pure math major or double major in finance and math?

"If I hate it, what else could I do?",23,0,False,False,False,actuary,1508406759,True,"Hey, I'm a noob to all this, but seriously planning to make this all my career change try, as it offers a path that is doable, good money, and a subject I enjoy. But of course, what if I get my first job and I hate it? Do other somewhat related jobs hire actuaries based on their skills proven in that area? I have a relative who works in finance, who described being an actuary as a 'niche thing', the implication being that working on programming and trying to get into finance offered a much wider array of options.

As background (I'll likely be posting here more in the future): I'm a musician with a music degree. I took graduate courses in Advanced Calculus/Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory (which used the Sheldon/Ross textbook). It was quite a thing to take that on flat out, and I got a 'B' in both courses.

Actually, for the first probability exam I scored better than 75% of the class, mostly because it involved a lot of intuition-requiring curveballs from the professor, which put me ahead of the pack. The second exam was more rote and calculus-based, and that's where the 50 math majors in the class with me had me crushed, because they had the experience I didn't. Similar, the other course was huge on proof and ideas I was leaning for the first time. I'm very hard on myself, so I suppose 'B' isn't terrible, but I wanted better (and an A or possibly B+ in both courses would have given me the option of entering the applied math grad program at a really good school).

Anyway, I'm taking a look at the P exam, and it doesn't seem too scary at all, in fact far less so than my graduate coursework. So I'm working back through the Sheldon/Ross and plan on trying a few practice exams. And that's basically where I'm at now."

"Looking for advice, in a unique situation",21,3,False,False,False,actuary,1508424416,True,"So a little background, after high school I never intended on going to college so I moved to a larger city and started working for a big church. Now I am 28 years old, have a wife and three kids, and a mortgage. I work 50-60 hours a week at this church and make 52k a year. They don't pay into retirement, instead of paying for health insurance they give me a cash stipend, and I was strongly encouraged to opt out of social security (ordained ministers can do this, they had me do it instead of getting a raise a few years back), so I currently don't have any funds going towards the end of my life. The leaders of this church offered to pay for two years of college for me and told me that when I get my Bachelors they will give me a 10k bump in pay. I am now in my final year of college, working full time and going to school full time. 

I love my current job, but the hours are long and really starting to wear on my wife. I decided to get a degree that would open up opportunities in actuarial work. What I am trying to figure out is when do I make the switch? Originally I was considering staying at the current job well after I receive my degree taking as many tests as possible. I don't want to leave this job until I can find a replacement for around 65-75k. I don't know if this is realistic or not. I don't really have anyone in my life that I can discuss these things with, if I mention to my job that I am considering a different career path, it's very likely that they will replace me in the near future, and I am certain that I won't be able to find a job that provides for my family so well without a degree. 

Is it realistic to think that I could complete all the required actuarial tests after my bachelors degree without any actuarial experience, and then look for a career in actuarial work? Does anyone have any suggestions on the best path forward for me?"

Some Encouragement,12,12,False,False,False,actuary,1509074486,True,"I know the people that tend to post on here paint a picture of the impossibly difficult EL market (selection bias, people!), but I wanted to share a bit of how I got my EL job (starts after May graduation). Hopefully, someone reading this can be encouraged or learn something.

A little background, I come from a non-target state school in the deep South, but recently landed a job at a top consulting firm in NYC with only one exam. I don't have any fancy programming knowledge either. So for everyone thinking that you NEED 3-4 exams to break into the EL market (especially in a ultra-competitive market like NYC), it's doable with less.

Why I think I got the job: I focused on leveraging non-traditional skills that I was passionate about that made me unique. Namely, I love filmmaking, and I am my school's newspaper's multimedia editor. How is that related to being an actuary? Well, I tied it into creative problem solving, organizational skills, and leadership experience. I think this was something that set me apart and was easy to talk about in an interview. 

Actuaries have a stereotype of being extremely boring. Use this to your advantage. If you can show something that you are passionate about (no matter what it is) and then tie those skills that you learned to being an actuary, you will have a headstart on the competition. Of course, a certain level of technical competency is required, but after that, be anything but a cookie cutter applicant. 

Hope that helps someone! Feel free to ask me any other questions.

EDIT: It seemed some people were misinterpreting this post. Let me add this:

The point is that everyone has something unique that they need to sell. For me, it was my filmmaking experience and my high GPA. For someone else, it may be their total exams passed. For another, it may be utilizing their programming knowledge. The whole point was to say don't look at posters on here and think look he/she has x amount of exams, x GPA, etc. Find your unique selling point and you'll be ok. "

But i'm just not yet finished with any exams yet and so I'll miss most of the internship deadlines as a junior and I was told they aren't really interested in seniors. So should I switch to a math degree, which will let me also finish my vee's, and stay back a year which will allow me to get more exams and an internship under my belt? Or should i finish my engineering degree? Also are VEEs an annoyance once you get your job? 

I feel I can sell myself as an engineer at the very least. I've done well as an engineer at a good university, involved in a few research projects and became a team lead for a research project. It's also that project that made me realize i didn't really care about engineering products but that I cared about the data. I also started my own ""flipping"" business, which has made me prefer business over engineering as well. I decided to officially become an actuary over the summer and taken the steps such as studying for the exams and becoming a board member at the only actuarial club at my school(my school doesn't have the program). I've studied the field a lot and i'm sure about the career switch so i'm fine with the switch up."

Question about majors in college from a high school senior,6,1,False,False,False,actuary,1509923497,True,"I'm a senior in high school, and I'm interested in an actuarial career, among some other career possibilities. I've always done extremely well in math classes and I've loved solving problems with math. As I am applying to colleges, I have been wondering what majors, other than actuarial science and math are possible for a career as an actuary. Specifically, I wanted to know if physics would be closely related enough to pursue an actuarial career. As physics has many math, statistics, and computer science classes as requirements I was wondering if this major is a possible option. I loved my physics classes in high school and wanted to explore that area a little in college. Has anyone majored in physics then became an actuary? "

Advice on what to do after graduation,7,2,False,False,False,actuary,1510085560,True,"Hey everyone, I'm graduating this December with a degree in accounting and I'm trying to get into the actuarial field.  My GPA is pretty shit, just barely above a 3.0 and I don't have any work experience besides working as a math tutor for the Princeton Review.  I passed exam P on my second try (scored a 5 on first attempt) and I'm taking FM in early December.  I have a good grasp of excel and tableau but not much idea on any other programs like python or SQL.


With no internship experience, an average GPA in a pretty unrelated field and only 1 maybe 2 exams completed by the time I graduate my question is what would be my best course of action in pursing a career as an actuary?  Should I work in the insurance industry and try to move up from a different department or just stick with accounting and try to eventually transfer professions completely.  

What is the best course of action in the meantime to make myself stand out, should I take a 3rd exam after FM or learn a programming language?

Also if you think I'm just completely fucked and won't be able to transition into the actuarial field in the next 3-5 years no matter how much effort I put in don't be afraid to say so.
 
tl;dr: Better to start off as a shit job in insurance industry, or shit accounting job and transfer into the insurance industry later?

If I went for the double major, I'd sacrifice the minors as well as any hope of taking an exam during my senior year.

"Pursue Career as an Actuary? Love Mathematics, Hate Statistics",14,0,False,False,False,actuary,1510131464,True,"Hi all:

I’m currently a sophomore in university, and I am pursuing a B.A. in mathematics.  I have been giving a lot of thought into what I’d like to do once I graduate from university, and a friend of mine mentioned looking into a career as an actuary.  After doing some research, I’ve learned that the career places a lot of emphasis on foundational mathematics (particularly calculus), yet, I have heard that the basis of the career seems to overlap greatly with applications of statistics.  Put simply, I absolutely loathe statistics.  I find it to be the most disgusting application of mathematics.  However, related to statistics, I do enjoy probability, as it seems to rely greatly on logic.  

TL;DR, should I consider pursuing a career as an actuary if I really enjoy mathematics, yet really detest statistics?  And, if not, I would really appreciate any recommendations as to possible careers to look into concerning mathematics.

[Exam FM] Force of interest question,2,3,False,False,False,actuary,1510345149,True,"&gt;At time 0, Cheryl deposits X into a bank account that credits interest at an annual effective rate of 7%. At time 3, Gomer deposits 1000 into a different bank account that credits simple interest at an annual rate of y%. At time 5, the annual forces of interest on the two accounts are equal, and Gomer’s account has accumulated to Z.
Calculate Z.

&gt;(A) 1160
(B) 1200
(C) 1390
(D) 1400
(E) 1510

Solution: A

Cheryl’s force of interest at all times is ln(1.07) = 0.06766. Gomer’s accumulation function is from time 3 is 1 + yt and the force of interest is y/(1 + yt). To be equal at **time 2**, the equation is 0.06766 = y/(1 + 2y), which implies 0.06766 + 0.13532y = y for y = 0.07825. Gomer’s account value is 1000(1 + 2x0.07825) = 1156.5.

_____________________________________________________________________
Why does the solution equate the force of interests at time 2 rather than time 5? From the question, we don't even know if the force of interests are equal at time 2 since it only specifies that they are equal at time 5.

I’m a 31 year old math teacher in my 6th year of teaching. I recently quit my job because the job was destroying my health. I have an MA in economics and a minor in mathematics. I have always loved working with and interpreting data. I really like statistics and probability. I don’t have any experience with computer science. I took a course on R in college but can’t say I remember much. 

My current plan is to enroll in some SQL courses and study for the first two actuarial exams. After I have those, I’m thinking about doing some programming courses. What else can I do to make myself hirable? Should I enroll in school? I probably have about a year where I don’t have to worry about being employed so I can dedicate myself to this. 

I appreciate any and all help you can give me. "

Why didn't they substract 500S(500). Because formula for E(x ^ 500)= integral from 0 too 500 of xf(x) + 500S(500). Can anyone explain why they didn't subtract the last term to get the integral from 0 too 500 of xf(x)?

I graduated college in Spring 2013 with a Mathematics degree with Actuarial emphasis. I have not gone into the actuarial field yet though. I've been working in the business world instead (I have a Business Admin minor). I did buy the ACTEX P/1 Study Manual 2010 edition when I was studying back in 2013 to take the exam. I knew I wasn't going into the field at that time, so I didn't study nearly enough to pass. I am now looking to enter the actuarial field though.

If you did a course with them before, did they give out answer keys to the homework problems? There are no examples with solutions in the text books.  I emailed NEAS a while ago asking that if after I submit my HW, could they email me back an answer key?  I'm not trying to cheat, I just need to know if I'm correct or totally off. That's why I asked them for keys after I've already submitted assignments.  They never get back to me though, even when I call. 

Does anyone know anything about answer keys from NEAS?  Does anyone know where I can go for help with this course? I'm really struggling and worried about the final exam.

Student looking for major advice,9,1,False,False,False,actuary,1510585297,True,"Hi r/actuary,

I am in need for some advice on what to do going forward. I do not mean for any of this to come off as a brag; I just need advice and want to give the full picture. To give some background, I have interned at an actuarial consulting company for a year now, and plan to stay with them through graduation, and then see what's available. Currently, I am a junior in college(U.S.) with a double major of actuarial science and economics.

My question is, should I drop the economics major and just finish the actuarial science major while working more, or does the economics major provide enough value to make this a poor trade off? If no employer would care about the economics major, I would drop it and take a partial credit load to work more and study for more exams. I currently have passed P, FM, and C. I will begin studying for MFE soon. It would also save money on tuition to drop the major. Unfortunately, even with dropping it, I would graduate at the same time because the classes I need to take are dependent on one another. 

Thank you for taking the time to respond!"

The company invests 15,000 in a bond with modified duration 1.80, and 45,000 in a bond with modified duration Dmod, to Redington immunize its position against small changes in the yield rate.

The annual effective yield rate for each of the bonds is 10%.
Calculate Dmod.

(A) 2.73
(B) 3.04
(C) 3.34
(D) 3.40
(E) 3.65

&gt;Solution: B

&gt;The present value of the assets is 15,000 + 45,000 = 60,000 which is also the present value of the liability. The modified duration of the assets is the weighted average, or 0.25(1.80) + 0.75Dmod. The modified duration of the liability is **3/1.1** and so Dmod = (3/1.1 – 0.45)/0.75 = 3.04.

I'm now trying to decide which to take.  They're both in the same city, about the same level of pay, and have similar exam support, but one is a P&amp;C role, and one is a Life &amp; Health role.

Job 1: 

-Small P&amp;C company that seems pretty stable, I would be only the second actuarial position on staff.  I certainly liked my would-be manager, but I had an easier time talking to the manager at Job 2.

-The company focuses on a niche within P&amp;C, in that it isn't auto, home, or any of the typical products.  Think flood, or wind &amp; hail.

Job 2:

-Small Healthcare company, I would be the 5th actuarial position on staff

-While I really enjoyed the actuarial team, I worry about the company itself.  The glassdoor reviews are pretty harsh, the manager admitted they sometimes have trouble retaining people, and that the data can be incomplete.  


Up until this point, I had always said I would go the actuarial route of whichever job I was offered first.  But now that I have a choice between SOA and CAS, I don't even know my preference.  So this decision is a choice between the sides of the career, as well as a choice between a company that I might prefer, versus a team that I might prefer.  Any input is welcome."

"CNA, Swiss Re, Protective, internship decision, which one?",19,2,False,False,False,actuary,1510703798,True,"Hello,

I need help choosing which one I should take. I'm really focusing on cost of housing, intangible benefit of working at that company (which is what I don't know about and want some opinion on), and any other insight you guys can provide  to help me make the decision would be of great benefit.

Me: I have one exam passed, research experience (1 working paper, 2.5 years of research), handful of leadership experience and meaningful volunteering, good gpa... From a Midwest state, far away from these opportunities, don't plan on spending too much money buying stuff while there. I really just wanna get some studying down, make a very good impression, and go out doing kayaking/rafting/adventuring things if I can in my free time.

Protective: Birmingham, 14/hr, housing provided, State tax ~4% while sales tax 4%, The guys hiring were phenomenal and made the job sound nice, they basically said what they would be easy for me given my background and said they enjoy having me on the team.

Swiss Re: Armonk, 22/hr, housing not provided (w/ roommate(s) I'm looking at $800-1000/mo), state tax ~6% while sales tax ~8.9%, Now, this was by far my favorite interview process of them all, fun question to solve, the interviewer hiring engaged me in Chess, because I am a big fan, and we talked about that for a while and told me I could carry on the chess club, and said the rest of the work would be great and engaging 

CNA: Chicago, ~21/hr (don't really know what it is yet), housing provided, State tax 3.75% while sales tax is like 10% (god damn), interview process has been all right &amp; the people I've talked to have been great. They seem like a very competitive company in terms of what they look for *&amp;* expect from their employees.

Now, it's really down to Swiss Re and CNA based on wage alone (which I care about a little). But Swiss Re doesn't offer housing and CNA does. 

I want to choose Swiss Re because of the environment and the company is well-known, but I really am turned away by the fact that housing isn't provided and the cost of housing is huge. roughly ~$750 worse off just off of housing alone, tax included probably brings me down (net) $850 a month [((1-.10-.06)22x40x4-900)-(1-.10-.04)21x40x4].

Can anyone bring some perspective in? I feel like I'd fit in better at Swiss Re, but god damn the cost is blaring. Is the reputation that much better, is the (from what I've read) a less stressful job worth the cost?

Starting to get a bit concerned (not a pity story),16,8,False,False,False,actuary,1510718736,True,"Hello r/actuary,

I am a junior mathematics major and I have posted here many times about exams, resume perfecting, etc. and I feel that this sub has been extremely helpful and honest at the same time, so I thank you all for that.

Coming into this semester, I was excited about applying for internships in the actuarial field and felt confident that I would be able to land one. Because I am a junior, I feel that I really, really need one. Without one, I will essentially be going into graduation without internship experience, and from what I can tell, getting into this field without it is extremely difficult (don't want to say impossible).

I've applied to nearly 60 companies. I have received three phone interviews, two recorded interviews, and a supplement request. So far, so good.

I managed to pass two phone interviews and reach the web cam interview. The rest didn't go anywhere.

Of the two web cam interviews, I finally got an answer today. Rejection. The other one was apparently supposed to let me know the result early last week (unless they meant ""next week"" as in this very current week). It is now the middle of this week.

In response to not getting a quick answer from the two companies I did web cam interviews with, I've sent about 15 more applications over the last week to get myself to the ~60 number I mentioned earlier, but since I felt I was in a good spot originally, I stuck with the ~40 applications I sent over the course of September to early October. So from early October to last week, I didn't send any applications (maybe one or two).

If I can't get an internship, what exactly should I do? I feel kind of cheated. I know it's my fault for not acing at least one of the two interviews or sending more applications, but man, with two exams passed (though one I just passed a few weeks ago) and a 3.9+ GPA, I felt getting an internship would be easier than this, despite going to a pretty small school. Should I stick with my usual summer job and keep studying for exams if I can't get an internship?

Is being an Actuary really that stable?,21,0,False,False,False,actuary,1510784735,True,"Hi, so I am working as an intern at a life insurance company. I was there full time this summer, continue to work part time, and have accepted a job in January.  
  
I am worried about a couple of things for the profession.  
  
Can insurance companies survive long term in a low interest environment? I know that the short term rate has started to go up, but the long term rate has not. The yield curve is flattening out which seems like it will be very negative for insurance companies.  
  
Also, it seems that many jobs that are done by a team of 10 people could be automated and turned into a 2 or 3 person job fairly easily. It seems that companies will need way less actuaries in the upcoming years because of this.  
  
Finally I feel as though the exams are a huge waste of time and are preventing actuaries from learning valuable skills such as python, and data science related topics.  
  
Can any experienced actuaries let me know what your thoughts are on these topics.

Am I being dramatic or is it time to leave?,35,22,False,False,False,actuary,1511038088,True,"Hello,

Half rant and half advice-searching incoming: I'm a Life actuary in the NE and I've been working for the same company and department for 3 years. I love the company I work for: the team is awesome, my manager is competent and friendly, and there's little stress.

But I'm getting dicked around. 

I was told 6 months ago that I was set to get a promotion, I confirmed this with my manager 4 months later, but come promotion time I learned that I did not in fact get one. Partially due to the fact that I got one 8 months ago, but this was because they were late on the first one. They're ""sure I'll be up for a promotion in 6 months"", but I've heard that song before.

What's funny about the timing is that a week before I was told I didn't get a promotion, I got my ASA. I consider myself a great actuary: I've never gotten anything but good reviews from my managers, I passed all my prelims in a row, I got my ASA before the age of 25, I'm one of the few people that knows R and I can build desktop apps with it, web scrape, etc. etc. 

On top of all of this, I'm now the lowest-titled ASA in the company. Not me and a few other recent-ASAs. I am literally the only ASA that's Actuary II in the company, all other 25+ ASAs are Actuary III or above. Of the 25 ASAs, 20ish work remotely or have the option to work from home whenever they want. I'm the only one that is specifically not given this freedom (there are 5ish ASAs I'm not sure about).

Needless to say I'm bummed I didn't get the 10% raise that comes with a promotion (I couldn't care less about the title change). I hope I don't sound bitter because I'm really not, business is business and I understand that. The department likely is only given a certain number of promotions per half-year and they went with other people. But I believe I'm worth more than my $77k salary in the market considering it's in the bottom 10% of the DW Simpson salary and I'm very good at what I do.

Does it sound like I'm getting shafted or does this sort of thing happen often that you just don't hear about? I don't really want to leave my company/team, but I can't sell myself short this early in my career. And when I inevitably look for a new job, what do I tell them when they ask why I'm leaving my current position? Is ""salary"" an acceptable answer?"

Non-Actuarial Job for Resume Experience,6,2,False,False,False,actuary,1511289333,True,"Hi all,

I graduated college a couple years ago (3.93 gpa- math degree). I've been working in the IT field since, but I'm trying to become an Actuary (IT was never my field of interest, just a job to pay the bills post-graduation).

I have exam P passed and will plan to take FM when it's next offered (after December). I didn't decide to go this route until after graduation so never had a chance to get any internships, and given the competitiveness of the EL market I understand that 1 exam and a good gpa won't cut it. 

As I work on FM and then hopefully a 3rd one, I'm thinking of other ways to bolster my resume. I'm looking into the technical skills course on Infinite Actuary, maybe that will help. However, I've also heard numerous times that for those struggling to find an EL job, to get a job in a related field- I guess some sort of business/finance job. I'm just curious if anyone could give any specific pointers on what to look for. I suppose I want something that will teach me some actuarial skills such as programming/working in excel/etc..., I'm just unsure what jobs to look for. Anyone have any advice?"

Is this the correct way to imply life expectancy from life insurance prices?,11,2,False,False,False,actuary,1511425755,True,"I model A life insurance contract as an investment bond for a life insurance company, where like any bond, the bond earns an interest rate for the life insurance company in the form of the premium paid by the clients covered by the life insurance contract. 

The interest rate earned per year must cover 3 things: the expected amount of death benefits payable per year (probability of death times the face value), the risk free rate and the risk premium for providing life insurance. 

Therefore, going by this, the total amount of death benefits (being the probability of death times the face value of the insurance) paid throughout the lifetime of the contract cannot be more than the total premium paid. 

For example, if a lifetime insurance contract with a face value of 500,000 charges a premium of $168 per month, then after 100 months, the probability of death is not expected to be more than 16800/500000 = 3.36%

"Critique my new, updated, super simple, elegant model of life insurance. I call it the “no free lunch” model of insurance.",17,0,False,False,False,actuary,1511498003,True,"Imagine you were offered unlimited term life and disability insurance of $100 for a premium of $1 per year (For simplication, assume no inflation). You also somehow know that after paying $1 per year for 50 years (total $50 paid) you would be able to claim the benefits of $100, netting you a 100% gain on your investment. Would you buy this life insurance? Hell yeah! Its basically free money. 

But would insurance companies offer a deal like this? Hell no. They would basically be donating money away. And even if they did, other people are going to spot the arbitrage just like you did, and they will keep bidding the premium prices up to $2 per year where the arbitrage will disappear.

In other words, in a market with perfect competition, the efficient market theory will always ensure that insurance consumers do not  earn a profit such that this elegant model holds: 

Total premium paid over the life of an insurance contract = total death benefits expected to be received over the life of an insurance contract 


This can be simplified to: 


Total premium paid over the life of an insurance contract = expected probability of death X face value of insurance contract 


Which can be rearranged to:


Probability of death = total premium paid over life of insurance contract / face value of insurance contract 


In other words, in a competitive market you can always be able to accurately predict your probability of death from looking at the insurance prices you have been quoted (by dividing the quote with the face value). 

Do you agree with all of the above? Scholarly critique would be welcome.

I think SAT scores are the best predictors of job performance,21,0,False,False,False,actuary,1511611631,True,"Being a good actuary requires these skill-sets:

- Being good at excel and vba (Especially knowing a lot of keywords)

- Being a good communicator. Writing English fluently.

- Being a logical thinker.

I'll explain why the SAT measures all the above skills.


As an actuary, you'll have to memorize thousands of excel and vba keywords, formulas, and syntax.
The SAT reading sections test two things:

- Ability to memorize thousands of both obscure and common vocabulary.

- Ability to understand semi-complex reading passages.

In my experience, I've noticed that my colleagues with high SAT reading scores (700+) knew a lot more excel formulas and syntax than my colleagues with lower SAT reading scores (500 - 690); when learning a new formula or keyword, I've noticed that the group with the higher SAT reading scores were able to recall the formula months after they've previously used it while the group with the lower SAT reading score were unable to recall even the name of the formula when needed even after a few days.  The former was also a lot better at comprehending long and technical e-mails.

Not only are Actuaries required to memorize large amounts of information, they're required to apply this information to solve complicated problems.
Actuaries don't use rocket science math, but they do lots of algebraic manipulations, so having a firm foundation of 9th grade algebra is essential for Actuaries. The SAT math sections test logical reasoning and thought process with only proficiency of 9th grade math as a prerequisite, and so it'll show if a candidate can apply knowledge of simple math to solve complex problems.

The writing section shows if a person can write English fluently. It shows communication skills. Since everyone understands the importance of communication, not much needs to be said here.

To be frank, the old SAT (Pre-2016) seems like a perfect test for actuaries (and a whole host of other occupations), so why aren't employers asking for them?
I think the first preliminary exam should be scoring above a 700 for each section on the pre-2016 SAT.

If you're wondering, my SAT score was a 2240 (710 R, 800 M, 730 W. Composite is somewhere around the 99-99+ percentile). No prep and only took it once at the start of my senior year in HS."

Which would you choose,21,6,False,False,False,actuary,1511628926,True,"I know this is a personal decision in the end but I'm wondering what you would do in my situation. I'm lucky enough to have two job offers on the table. 

A: 65K + 2K for relocation, 10 vacation days in DC, P/C
B: 67K + 2K signing bonus, 5 days vacation in a small town in IL, Life/Health

The money from B would go a long way especially coming straight out of college. Where for A i would need to find roommates to live comfortably in DC. A i would be closer to family and have the night life that B wouldn't be able to offer. I'm just wondering where you would choose if given this choice. "
"[Job] Career changer - should I accept this ""job"" offer?",4,3,False,False,False,actuary,1511637834,True,"I'm in the process of dropping out of my Economics PhD program (I have my M.A.; B.A. was Math &amp; Econ from Cornell) - I put it as ""exiting academia"" in interviews - and entering actuarial. My only offer at the moment is an ""actuarial co-op"" (sounds more like an internship) for $21 / hr, full time for 6 months (July - Dec), no benefits, no relocation assistance, no exam assistance, no guarantee of a proper EL job afterward. The location is near Boston, and the rents nearby are ~$2k/mo for 1 bed, and not the easiest place to get a roommate, either. (I would really prefer Hartford, CT; somewhere in RI; or NY outside of NYC.)

I don't want to mention the company, out of privacy concerns and respect for them as well, but if you think it's a major factor, I can add it.

When this was the only offer I got this Fall, I was really disheartened. I've passed P &amp; FM, and just sat for MFE, but I'm not feeling too confident about it. I have 6 years of experience as a teaching assistant &amp; I've taught my own courses in-person and offline, and I tutor Math &amp; Econ privately on the side. I know Stata like the back of my hand; it's similar to R, and involves ""programming"" scripts to clean data, run models, &amp; produce tables / graphics. (As far as real programming, I took a few Java courses and I'm good with ""programming logic"" though I don't remember the commands very well.) Regression analysis (incl. TS and panel), data cleaning, visualization, and explaining / presenting results come naturally to me - professors I've taken courses from and TAed for can attest to this. I'm working on learning SQL and the more advanced Excel functions.

What I really need answered are: 

- What would *you* do if you were changing careers: take it, or keep looking? Why?

- Am I a competitive EL candidate? As in, if I keep looking, is it likely someone with my credentials would be likely to land an EL job this Spring, Summer, or Fall?

- What about as an intern / co-op candidate?

- Should I look for non-actuarial jobs instead, and work there until I have more relevant experience (and MFE / C)?

Thank you very much for any insight or knowledge you can give me, especially fellow career changers, or anyone with hiring experience!"

Opinions on Extending Undergrad/ Get Graduate Degree to become an actuary,4,1,False,False,False,actuary,1511686787,True,"Currently I’m studying finance at OSU with plans to graduate SP19 (which means I’ve only spent 3 years at university bc I got a ton of post secondary credit to remove some of the ‘fluff’ courses). I was disappointed the program here isn’t very mathematical and so I want to explore options for building my skill while prepping me for a career. I’ve considered extending my undergrad since I still have financial aid that applies to undergrad (won’t go for grad level studies) but I’m not sure if dedicating an extra year just to help me prep for exams is worth it. 

Is the assumption for students wanting to be actuaries to complete the first 2 exams by graduation? Do some go for grad degrees while studying &amp; taking exams?

Also, I wanted some opinions on 2 grad programs I liked at my university. One is a mix of Actuarial &amp; Applied Statistics/QRM

But what worries me is that on the sample exam site they stated it may not reflect the actual difficulty. Also I realized the sample exams have a lot of repeated questions and I'm afraid that is the reason why I'm getting passing grades.

Need advice on very embarrassing situation,51,46,False,False,False,actuary,1511884940,True,"As an actuary, I struggle with human interaction, and there are times when I would make a socially inappropriate gesture without even realizing it.

I have a coworker (let's call her Connie) who is objectively very pretty.

Now, before anyone starts, I have NO interest in this woman at all.

Often times, Connie would wear these short tight skirts without leggings, and because I have trouble maintaining eye contact, I would sometimes look down at her legs. I'm not focusing on her legs, but to the other person, it would seem like I'm checking her out.

One day, Connie pulled me aside and asked if I liked her since I stare at her legs and that she caught me glancing at her ass (I don't know where she got the 2nd part. I don't think I've checked out her ass).

I, of course, told her no, and she seemed pretty insulted. Maybe it was the way I said it.

In any case, Connie has been ignoring me for a whole month now and I fear I ruined a good relationship with a close co-worker.

Career change advice,16,2,False,False,False,actuary,1511892106,True,"Hello, 

So I recently graduated with a degree in biology and since statistics was a passion of mine that I learned about late in life, I was thinking about maybe going into a biostatistics masters, that was until I learned about actuarial sciences. I did my research and this job is all I could ever wish for, but I have a few question about changing careers especially with my background and at this stage in my life (no job experience/fresh out of school)

I’m not very worried about the exams themselves as I am very gifted at math and statistics(according to my old stats professor),and I don’t need to work while I study for them as I have some financial support giving me the ability to study for exams full time. What I am worried about is my degree and more so the fact that I have no internships. It seems from my research that internship nowadays is key to getting entry level jobs. 

So my question to you is, if I had passed 3 to 4 exams in a year, not working or any internships and only studying full time+doing the VEE courses online , would I be able to get an entry level job somewhere in the United States? A friend suggested that I look into a cheap masters program in status or something close, and take the tests/get an internship then. I’m okay with doing that if it’s what it takes to become an actuary. I just don’t want to waste time and money to grad school and internships if they’re not really necessary. 

Any help with the next steps, study guide recommendations, and everything in between would be greatly appreciated. "

[FM] Compound Increasing Annuity question,2,3,False,False,False,actuary,1511899366,True,"I'm using the BPP manual to study for FM and after failing my last attempt, I had a question about the formula mentioned in the title and if it can be used for a compound decreasing annuity.

Normally, i is our interest rate and e is the percent increase of the payments with 

j = (i-e)/(1+e)

and the PV of an immediate annuity would then be 1/(1+e) * [annuity immediate using j]

if the payments are decreasing each payment, could e just be negative and the formula still work? I ask because I had a few problems on the exam I failed using payment streams that decreased by a percentage and was curious if I could use this to work with them"

Advice on Relocating,10,6,False,False,False,actuary,1512004744,True,"Hi everyone,

I am currently working in a non-traditional role at a somewhat well known P&amp;C company. I graduated a year ago and have been in my current role for currently a year. I am trying to relocate to another major city for personal reasons, but I have been having a lot of difficulty. I've had 2 phone screens where they never contacted me back (even after following up), I believe it is because once I explain my role they are not sure if my experience is what they are looking for. I felt as if I was having a lot more success when I was applying for full time in college, and not sure what to do from here. I have passed an exam this year, and in good standing with work and the student program.

My major options are stop applying and pass more exams while waiting another year (I feel as if I will run into the same issue as I am having now) or trying something different such as trying to go to career fairs there? Anyone having any recommendations?"
What if I don't get a full-time/internship?,13,5,False,False,False,actuary,1512027211,True,"Hi everyone, I'm a 4th year in college with 1 exam passed, waiting for the results for another. I plan to pass 3 exams total before I graduate (hopefully). 

I'm a little worried that I won't be able to land a summer internship or a full-time job when I graduate. I submitted applications 2 months ago and haven't heard back, but I have friends who got interviews and eventually positions from those companies that I applied to. 

Should I opt for a masters degree, would that help me out in the hiring process/long-run or should I keep studying for exams and keep applying for something till I get it? 

Does anyone have any advice on how I should move forward? Thanks in advance! "

CGDP Questions,2,1,False,False,False,actuary,1512054948,True,"I’m relatively new to MAPD work.  Trying to get a handle on CGDP payment flows. The way I understand it is that the plan sponsor (my company) advances the CGD at the POS for the beneficiary.  To assist with doing so, CMS pays us extra monthly revenue (seen in the corresponding CGDP field in the MMR file).  Then, on a periodic (somewhat quarterly?  I know there’s a calendar for this) basis, CMS send invoice reports to both us and the corresponding Pharma companies based on our PDE data.  Pharma pays us, and our invoices from CMS come through in the Plan Pay Report.  This happens for 6 quarters.

So essentially at this point, Pharma has paid us back for what we actually advanced for CGD at the POS and we have paid back CMS for this same amount.  What I’m wondering is, when/how do we pay back CMS for the difference between the revenue they gave us and what we actually paid out?  I have an estimate based on MMR versus PDE data, but expected some sort of report.  I know there is a CGDP Reconciliation Results Report because it is listed on the TPA site, but I’ve never received and no one at my company seems to know what’s going on as this is a new process to us."

Changing Fields,5,5,False,False,False,actuary,1512094811,True,"So I've been working as an Actuarial Analyst for 3 years now at a small retirement firm. I enjoy what I do, but I think I am going to be ready for a change in the next year or so. I'm not so comfortable with the outlook of the retirement field, and I'm interested in relocating.

I'm sure I could find a job in my prospective city, but I'm unsure of what to expect. I've got 4 exams passed (and I believe I have passed my 5th), but if I choose to enter a new field such as life or health will I be treated like an entry level candidate?

Another snag is my company's exam policy. As a smaller firm, we do exam bonuses rather than exam raises. If you don't remain at the firm for at least a year after passing then you must forfeit the exam bonus. Seeing as though I passed 2 exams in the past year, this will be tough to swallow. I'm hoping a pay increase at a new job will compensate for the money I would be foregoing. I think my salary right now is on the low end for someone with my credentials (~50k in the southeast) so that's another big reason I'm considering a move.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice, I'd love to hear it."

An interesting title.,16,0,False,False,False,actuary,1512155632,True,"Tldr;

1. How much of your time is spent on data?

2. Do/have you ever done any interesting statistics in an actuarial role?


Basically I'm in a new role as a graduate actuarial analyst, most of my time is spent cleaning and fixing data issues.

I don't enjoy this. I also don't see this changing anytime soon as the data we have is very poor and any analysis/statistics Id like to do would just be too unreliable.

My main concern at this point is that my future in any actuarial role will be a suped up data analyst until I go into a lead role, completely bypassing any modeling/statistical work which is the main reason I'm here in the first place.

Feedback welcome.

and

-Is there any advice you have to gain more interest from Actuarial HR Recruitment personnel? or any way you would recommend I separate myself from other applicants?

Do you guys ever regret choosing this career path?,50,4,False,False,False,actuary,1512232721,True,"Let's be honest, most of us are doing it for the money. So I decided to compare it up against other fields. So I checked some salaries from glassdoor: Here is the national averages from each one: (Not sure how legit they are)

Actuary: $123k ($131k in SF)

Data scientist: $129k ($152k in SF).

Machine learning engineer /scientist: $128k ($151k in SF)

Quantiative analyst: $109k

Quantitative researcher: $161k ($170k in NY).

All of the jobs here you can do with a degree in math / statistics I guess. To add a few other fields too: 

Software engineer: $110k (130k in SF)

Medical physicist: $130k

Chief Actuary: $171k

Medical doctor: $179k

Neurosurgeon: $490k

Keep in mind, these are all national averages. Obviously Chief Actuary, quant researcher, neurosurgeon is probably very unrealistic but apart from that you guys could've probably done the majority of the things on this list, maybe except for medical doctor too? (idk). But do you ever regret choosing this path? Like even just comparing it to software engineering. (I've never had a job before, but I feel like you'd feel more rewarded, fulfilled and more useful being a software engineer than an actuary?). Imagining just completely mastering software engineering and grinding the fuck out of it (which is extremely linear and easy, (doesn't get much easier than that)), Which doesn't sound too boring, and is probably pretty useful in the future too? Think of the insane demand of medical doctors these days (and the future), software engineers, ML, statistics (big data), this is gonna be huge in the future. Technology brings insane amounts of data. Think of your phone (your position, movement,..) google's search engine (what you click on), all the technology people have in their homes etc. Seems like statistics and CS is gonna be the future, might as well just try to get really good at those fields as fast as possible. If you're sitting there as a software engineer you're atleast improving with regard to the future (since you're programming all day, seeing improvement everyday), not sure if I can say the same for actuary (which is my main concern)."

Cold emailing works!,20,32,False,False,False,actuary,1512448551,True,"Hey r/actuary, just wanted to do a quick follow-up.

From three weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/7d1imx/starting_to_get_a_bit_concerned_not_a_pity_story/

I was devastated to find out that the other company I did a web cam interview with declined me. In the middle of November, I felt that I was in a tough spot and was very, very worried and anxious about it. I began to apply for analyst positions (none of which have responded) and then wondered if there was anything else I could do since I didn't want to give up on the actuarial internship search.

In these desperate times, I did something that the actuary community seems split 50/50 on. I decided to cold email 100+ chief actuaries, sending them my resume and asking for advice (not a position, since I knew it was near the end of recruiting season, but any kind of advice).

To my astonishment, I got about 30 emails back, a lot of which had good substantial advice. Best of all, I ended up with three phone interviews despite not explicitly asking for a position. This was just as many interviews as I had gotten through online applications. One of those (so far) has turned into a web cam interview. I just found out today that the interview turned into an offer! Barring a better offer coming along before the deadline, I will likely accept it.

I know that your first thought might be that I'm trying to brag, but the truth is I've read a lot about cold emailing on here and on actuarial outpost and it seems to be something that a lot of people (not everybody, but a lot) downtalk as unnecessary, a waste of time, and disrespectful to those that you're contacting. Honestly, while it's different for everyone, I feel like I got more success out of it than online applications, and it was far less time consuming, too.

After I had sent 15-20 cold emails, I started to think maybe it was 
a waste of time, but early on, one chief actuary quickly responded that I was ""doing the right thing"" and that I should ""keep sending my resume to people.""

If anybody is ever in a position like me, don't be shy or afraid to send cold emails. It works. It gets your name out there."

Usage-Based Car Insurance?,18,7,False,False,False,actuary,1512637015,True,"Just wondering if any P&amp;C actuaries can weigh-in on the actuarial work involved in usage-based car insurance (UBI) vs. traditional auto insurance.

I’m SOA-route with 5 years working in Health, so I’m fairly unfamiliar with both lines. I did browse the beginning chapters of the CAS Ratemaking Exam (5?) and I recall the author mentioning that usage-based Insurance is rare because it’s difficult to capture exposure accurately; that being said, the UBI products I’ve researched will require some sort of GPS-Tracker installation as part of the policy terms.

How is the outlook for actuaries working with UBI products? This seems like a fairly new offering of car insurance; is UBI anticipated to stick around/boom/become obsolete?

"Taking exam P in March, never taken a probability course",12,1,False,False,False,actuary,1512956560,True,"Right now, I'm looking to allocate my time to take (and preferably pass) exam P in March, and take FM in August. Is this too ambitious? My main goal is to hopefully gain an internship this summer and need an exam passed. I want to take FM in August because I'm taking a class for it this spring semester and would like to keep the information relatively fresh in my head.

For exam P, I haven't taken any sort of probability course. However, I just finished taking all three semesters of calculus so that's all pretty fresh in my mind. I've been thinking of using TIA which is somewhere around 200, or using coaching actuaries' study bundle for double the price. I know a lot of people enjoyed Adapt (included in the study bundle), so regardless I'd like to use that, but since I haven't taken a probability course I think having access to video lectures would be beneficial in addition to a study manual, it's just a question of which lectures to use. Would anyone agree this is a good approach, or would anyone have any alternate suggestions?

Also, if I started studying after Christmas, would that be adequate time to study for the exam in March? I've seen many people say you only need 60-80 hours study time, but since I haven't seen the material much, I'm assuming I'll need a bit more time."

Thoughts on the IFoA new syllabus,0,1,False,False,False,actuary,1513114694,True,"As I'm sure my fellow British actuarial students are aware the IFoA is implementing a new course structure and in spite of all their spiel that nothing is changed they have also expressed a desire to prepare actuaries for more general roles. 

They have also added computing elements to the examinations, whilst also claiming to not be adding any additional hours of study or exam time.

So I am wondering, is the new syllabus going to be easier which will reduce the barrier to entry for prospective actuaries or is it actually going to be even harder providing expected earnings for those who do make fellowship?

Right now the IFoA seems to be totally contradicting themselves in the various communications they are putting out.

How do health actuaries in countries with a single payer system differ from those in the US?,9,8,False,False,False,actuary,1513116544,True,"Looking a bit through old posts, I've seen people ask what would happen to the US health actuary industry if we switched to a single payer system and everyone basically says it won't happen.

But im about 9 months in at this point and I feel like im trapped. Everyone at my office is so nice and supportive and they love me. I dont FEEL like im a good employee, i fuck around so much cause im lazy and hate the work i do. But they have nothing but praise for me and keep adding on my responsibilities, and they expect such big things from me. And here i am wishing i get run over by a car so i have an easy way out.

I thought being a part of something important would help me feel motivated and validated in a professional sense. All I've come to realize is i fucking miss my retail job that i had all throughout high school and college. It was so easy and simple...I always told myself that I couldnt wait to start my real job and be happy im making a difference. But i dont actually care. Im a lazy fuck. I just want to clock in at 8am at minimum wage, fuck around all day, leave at 5, and get my life back. The money isnt worth it. I mostly just spend it on stupid stuff anyway.

I wish i had never heard of this stupid career, and I hate the fact that I'm somewhat good at it cause now I dont want to let everyone down.

Looking for some insight,10,5,False,False,False,actuary,1513187730,True,"Hey everyone,
I’m looking for some insight on how to move forward in this career. Some background: I graduated back in May, and have been actively applying (although I could do better) to full time positions with no luck. I’ve had 2 serious interviews since applying, both led to nothing (some of the circumstances were difficult with location). My undergrad GPA was a 3.6, I have 2 exams (waiting on results for 3rd, but I feel like I probably got a 4/5), &amp; my biggest fault I’m aware of, is that I don’t have any relevant experience.

&amp;nbsp;

The way I see it I have a few options,

&amp;nbsp;

*Keep applying for full time work. I have a part-time job at the moment (albeit not greatest pay), however I am lucky that I am in a relatively good state. By this, I mean my parents probably won’t kick me out of the house until I am on my feet. The problem I am seeing is whether I may be hitting a dead end, and don’t find a job.

&amp;nbsp;

*Go back for graduate school in statistics. This is something I’ve considered, but don’t really want to take out more loans for. I most likely will have the opportunity to TA a class if I do go back, and this would at least partially cover tuition costs. I also figured I might be able to find some work on the side to help pay for living expenses while I do this. I know the general consensus here is that graduate school is not necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

*Completely leave the actuarial field altogether. I really don’t want to start looking for other work, but I feel as though this is a serious option. I really do love learning about all of the statistics that goes into these exams, but I do know the actual job does not really entail much about the exams. Friends and family have pointed out I should probably go back to teaching (which was my original major before switching to actuarial science). I’m not necessarily against this, because I do think I would enjoy teaching, but the pay is the part I can’t really get around.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of my thoughts:
At the moment, I feel pretty lost on how to move forward. My plan was to at least apply for graduate school in statistics at the university I just graduated from. I would most likely get accepted and be able to TA to cover some costs. I don’t believe I need to take GREs from what I read (need to look more into it) so I can focus on actuarial exams for the time being. I was thinking about applying to full time jobs, as well as internships for the summer. I would make a separate resume for internships (upon finding out if I got into grad school), and say that I am attending graduate school come fall. If I got offered an internship, I would go to grad school if necessary/take the position, and if I got offered a full time, I would take the position. If I go back to school, I would probably try to get in touch with one of the local insurance companies just to see if I can either shadow/volunteer/intern throughout the year, while looking for internships for the summer. I would hope by the time I graduate, I would have 4-5 exams done w/ internship experience. The biggest problem with this is that I would have to take out more loans, and I would miss the opportunity to work for the next 2 years. I appreciate any advice, be it positive or negative, and I hope this may be able to help other people in the same situation. Thanks for reading

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: should I go back to graduate school if I can’t find a job? What are some other options?

It's been a monkey on my back, my first fail after scoring a 9, 10, and 8 on P, FM, and MFE respectively.  I felt unstoppable, but was humbled by the vast syllabus of Exam C.  My best subjects were Credibility Theory and Parametric Models, but empirical and aggregate models were my weaknesses.

My workload has been incredible.  I'm a math department head at an urban school and my department is heavily understaffed.  We have long term subs in two classes, and if it weren't for my efforts making video lessons, guided notes, and assessments, 400 students would be going without instruction.

"How can I pass a FAP Final retake, if I don't know why I failed the first time?",12,2,False,False,False,actuary,1513281945,True,"I've never failed an exam in my life before now. I've passed all five ASA prelim exams with 9s and 10s, and my Interim Assessment on the first try.

I felt pretty confident in my Final Assessment when I submitted it. I felt like I answered the questions accurately, succinctly, and clearly. My total response was on the short end, 15 pages compared to the 15-20 page range they recommended, but I didn't want to pad my answers just for the sake of length.

And then I got ""Does Not Meet Minimum Requirements"". The only explanation given was that ""Questions 1 and 2 show the most room for improvement."" Which is almost completely useless.

I'm retaking the Assessment in 4 days and I'm worried that I'm going to fail again. I've looked over my old assessment, and it looks fine to me--which means that I don't know what to do differently in the retest, only that if I do the same thing I'll fail a second time.

I'm completely baffled. I don't know how I'm supposed to improve, if I don't know what I did wrong. Was the problem that I didn't give enough detail? Was the problem that I took the wrong tone in my writing? Were my answers factually incorrect, or not the answers they were looking for? I have no idea, and I have no idea if I'm even allowed to ask for help. 

I need help, /r/actuary. What are the graders looking for? What separates a ""does not meet"" from a ""meets minimum requirements""? Or am I just completely screwed?"

Does this sound like a good plan? (College Student),12,3,False,False,False,actuary,1513454939,True,"Hi all. I've been interested in becoming an actuary as of late.

I've been directionless for most of my life in terms of careers, but have always been able to achieve academically.

A little about me: I am very math oriented, I hate studying liberal arts. I currently attend Tulane University and am majoring in Finance and Math. I am an independent learner, and prefer learning material on my own rather than from a teacher in a classroom. Also, math has always been my favorite subject, and the business courses I have taken in college have been the ones I have enjoyed the most and excelled at the most. After talking on the phone with a few actuaries that my school connected me with, I am pretty confident I want to pursue this career. (But let me know if it sounds like a bad idea lol).

Anyways, I have not taken a single exam. I am currently finishing my first semester of sophomore year, and am looking ahead to summer. Now, I want to go abroad, but not necessarily during the school year. I was looking to go abroad this summer to a couple of places, and spend my summer traveling rather than working, as I don't think I will get the opportunity again (I spent last summer taking way too many classes).

I was wondering if I should try to go abroad, or pursue an actuarial internship? Will it hurt me too much to not have an internship down at this point (I know the answer is probably no, but I'm still worried). Additionally, I would LOVE to intern somewhere. Nothing would make me happier. However, I think it is too late in the process to obtain an internship, unfortunately (unless anyone here knows of any opportunities!).

So would it be best to go abroad? I was thinking of doing a 3-4 week abroad trip through my school, possibly birthright, and maybe a short program volunteering in another country. I've never been outside of the US (with the exception of Canada) and am eager to do it. However, I would be just as happy crunching numbers and learning the ins and outs at an insurance company. :)


I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I'm just kind of looking to spell everything out/receive feedback to see if this makes sense, as its all jumbled in my head right now.

So, I'm here for any advice, wisdom, literally anything anyone here can tell me to help me. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Thank you!

Switching Career Path Junior Year,15,3,False,False,False,actuary,1513866813,True,"Hi all, 

Since Middle School, I've only wanted to be a Doctor. I'm currently in my Junior Year studying Biology and was preparing to apply to Medical School, when I realized I'm not going to be happy doing this and I will barely see my friends and family for the next 10-15 years. 

Math has always been my best subject, and I really enjoyed taking Biostatistics this past semester. My AP calc teacher in high school said that being an Actuary is a very stable, good paying career if you put the effort into taking all of the tests. 

At this point, I'm just trying to find out possible career paths. 

I really enjoyed using R in biostats and using python at my first co-op, so I talked with my advisor and I will be able to fit in a computer science minor. At this point, I'm considering a couple fields. 

* Computer Science Related: I have no clue what I would do with this, but I really enjoy programming. There's so much you can do with computer science, so at this point there are just too many options to decide. I'll have a better idea once I take my fundamentals of computer science. 
* Biostatistician: I liked biostats, and my professor encouraged me to check out Masters or potentially a PhD. 
* Actuary: I liked learning about probability in biostats. This also would pay the most in the end, and I like the idea of progression through taking tests. 

If I end up going down the actuarial path and am able to take the first 2 exams before graduating, what would my next 10 years look like? "

Some questions on Validation by Educational Experience (VEE),13,2,False,False,False,actuary,1513993687,True,"Hi,

I've recently considered starting the actuarial track and am hoping for more detail on VEE. I have looked through /r/actuary's FAQ and searched for [VEE] and [Validation Education] and didn't find too many helpful results for my concerns, though [this was great](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/5m1beb/purpose_of_vee_validation_by_educational/) and knocks out a few of my more basic questions.

https://www.soa.org/Education/Exam-Req/Instructions-for-VEE-Directory.aspx

From the above link I navigated to my school and found I qualify for all three areas (Econ BS paying off!). So while this seems like a less important aspect of the journey, it's a requirement nonetheless and I'm fairly stoked I actually have this met already - though it seems this could change given the update in VEE coming next year. I see in an FAQ [here](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/resources/edu-vee-applying-faq.aspx):

&gt;**What are the requirements to apply for VEE credit?**

&gt;A candidate is eligible to submit a VEE Candidate Credit Application once credit for at least two of our 
&gt;actuarial exams appear on the SOA online transcript. While unofficial pass/fail results are available at 
&gt;the conclusion of CBT exams, the results are official only when added to your SOA online transcript. 
&gt;More information on the process and the applications can be found on the VEE Home Page.

So it looks like I cannot submit my application until I pass two exams. Damn (though I get why). I see [here](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-vee.aspx) that there will be changes to what is considered VEE.

So my questions are these (thank you if you are still reading!):

Based on the schedule I'm anticipating for exams, I've sat for 0 with maybe my first one in April, multiple of my VEE-qualifying courses will have expired from their approved timeframe. 

* Does anyone here have experience with requesting permission for an extension of the approval time period for their qualifying courses to be considered for VEE credits? What was the result? 

* Is extension of the approval timeframe for VEE-qualifying courses something I can request directly, or must I ask a professor to request on my behalf (as one of the sites seems to say) for the TPTB to begin reviewing the case?

* Having sat for no exams, can I set up requesting approval of extending the timeframe of my courses now?

Thank you in advance!

With manuals, video lessons, near infinite practice problems, and entire undergraduate degrees dedicated to passing three or four three hour exams they aren't difficult enough to act as the barrier to the profession as they were fifteen years ago. My understanding is that before the explosion of the actuarial career someone taking Exam P would have seen very few of the questions before and would have to work from first principles to solve a lot of them. With ADAPT and other aids a student can walk into the exam and have seen almost every single problem before, albeit with different numbers.

Does anyone else have thoughts on this? I'd love to have a discussion.

Merry Christmas to my fellow /r/actuary users by the way!"

So the content seems to be focused on memorizing lists, which is daunting because of the number of them, but no surprises there. But then, the practice problems at the end of each huge section seem to require a different set of skills entirely. Even after going through all the content of the section, the numerical problems seem really hard - I'm never sure exactly what they're looking for and each one seems like the process is totally different.

Also there don't seem to be a whole lot of practice problems...really anywhere. TIA only gives a few at the end of each huge section it seems. How do people practice for this, just using old exams? "
Career change,9,8,False,False,False,actuary,1514258568,True,"Hi all,

I've been a structural engineer for just shy of six years and thinking of a change. Just wanted to ask you folks for some thoughts.

For some background, I'm in Australia. We don't get a masters here to work, so i have my Bachelors of Engineering. I studied a dual degree so I also have a Bachelors of Science majoring in maths. I studied the BE for a job and the BSc for interest.

My main gripe with the engineering field is its sensitivity to economic fluctuations. This seems to be particularly true in Australia, where we've been overly dependent on the mining industry for decades. That industry collapsed here in about 2012, which coincided with the start of my full-time career. There's speculative talk of a resurgence now. Even if this proves correct, I feel very bitter about the way the engineering companies seem to ride high on the economic waves and then the troughs seem to come as a complete surprise to them every time. The companies then have a very limited reactionary arsenal to stay alive. The employee depression that goes along with company deployment of this arsenal is something I've really hated. I want to try to minimise risk of being exposed to such a state with any career change I make.

It seems to me that working with financial/risk issues in a career will minimise this risk because clients are more varied. I reason that at any point there should be more potential clients in a diverse field such as actuarial work compared with something more niche like engineering. I think that in the actuarial field even if, say, the engineering clients drop off the radar for a few years, there should still be clients from other fields that haven't collapsed. Meanwhile if the engineering clients drop off for an engineering consultant, there's nothing else to do but cut costs or shut up shop. You guys are the experts in issues such as these, so maybe your first insights could be either correcting me or agreeing with me here?

Another reason I'm attracted to actuarial studies is the 'bigger picture' of the analysis I could do. Typical calculations I perform tell me if, for example, a group of bolts will pass or fail when subjected to a particular load. It seems that the only way to end up working with bigger picture tasks is to take on people management. While challenging and interesting, I dislike the speculative nature of this sort of work and I think I'd be dissatisfied with the way engineers seem to have to go into solely people management and no longer get to perform any analysis because it's the only way to progress his or her career. So the second piece of information I'd be interested in from you folks is whether the analysis you perform is (in your opinion) ""bigger picture"" than, say, structural engineering calculations.

Finally, I'd appreciate a bit of local advice if possible. I'm based in Brisbane where it seems there are limited opportunities for either education or work in this field. I'm free to move though, and I was thinking Sydney for UNSW or Canberra for ANU if I were to study. Melbourne is also an option or even overseas if that works. I don't know if I should study the Undergraduate Actuarial Studies, or if I should skip to Masters. Although the high price of the Masters does push me towards Undergraduate. I think I can still put the Undergraduate on HECS-HELP even with the government's recent lifetime limit of ~$104,000. I also wonder if I should study at all, or just try to (somehow) get some contacts in the industry and try to work with my current qualifications. Obviously, this wouldn't be actuarial work, but something in the same vein. Maybe I could get some experience and if I'm still interested in actuarial work I could start to study either part of full time. Actually, I'm not even sure that I'd even be accepted into the degree because even though I got Honours I in engineering, my grades weren't great and it was only just (~6.21 GPA) and my grades in maths were a bit poor in the end because I was focusing or trying to get Honours I in engineering. Anyway, some thoughts here would also be appreciated.

Thanks very much for anybody who gets through that wall of text and extra thanks for anybody who replies."

I got FM passed but I am unsure if taking both MFE and P at the same time (1 week interval between each other) in March is a really bad idea when I am studying now. I haven't seen anyone try multiple exams at once so I don't know if it's even worth doing it. 

Also, I know that instant CBT results will not be released for MFE in March but, what about if you signed up for receiving the text message whether you passed or not? I don't get any text msg for Exam MFE as well? "

Best Resources for Exam C,6,5,False,False,False,actuary,1514337012,True,"I am a student in college planning to take exam C in June of 2018. I am wondering what materials you all think would be best. I obviously do not have unlimited money and currently I'm thinking my two options are TIA by itself or a combination of the ASM manual + ADAPT + Mahler exams.

Which Exam Next?,5,4,False,False,False,actuary,1514340828,True,"Hi all, so far I've passed two actuarial exams (FM &amp; P). I'm a Junior in college and was wondering which SOA exam should I take next.

I'm stuck between taking either MLC or MFE. 

The pro's of taking MLC are that I've been introduced to most of the material through my college's courses. The con's are that it is changing immediately after the April sitting. 

The pro's of taking MFE are that I'm taking a preparatory class for that as well this semester. The con's are that I'll be further putting off MLC and the SOA syllabus is changing as well.

tl;dr Which exam should I take after P &amp; FM this spring?"

Is transferring schools worth it?,7,4,False,False,False,actuary,1514381644,True,"I’m currently attending St. Louis University, a UCAP-IC school.

Would transferring to a CAE be worthwhile? What benefits would I receive by going to such a  university?

Am I wasting my time pursuing this career?,27,14,False,False,False,actuary,1514493789,True,"I've read a few similar stories asking for advice, but I feel like mine may be unique enough for its own thread. Sorry if it isn't.

I graduated back in 2016, at age 25, with a BS in Psychology from a state school with a mediocre GPA (3.3). I'd had some major personal bumps in the road (who hasn't?) and I'd never taken school very seriously. Reality hit shortly after I graduated and realized I'd either need to go to graduate school (which wasn't really an option) or go back for a second bachelor's in a field that actually has a path to a career. I decided to go back for a bachelor's in Accounting.

I clued in a family member (who is an actuary, FSA) about my decision and he said ""why don't you just be an actuary?"" He made it sound like you really just needed two exams and some interviewing skills to land a job. Based on what I've read since then, that is not seeming like the case. He graduated in the early 00s. Maybe that's how it was back then. I don't know. I passed Exam FM back in August and am planning to take Exam P in March. I also will complete The Infinite Actuary's Tech Skills Course shortly after that.

I just don't see a path to a career with my unique (bad) background:

- Degree in non-quantitative field (can't fix)
- Mediocre GPA (can't fix)
- No internship (very difficult to fix)
- Limited knowledge of Excel and programming languages (can sort of fix with TIA course)
- No relevant experience (can fix with analyst job maybe?)

My only saving grace is that the aforementioned family member has some really good connections in the field. I just don't know how willing he will be to go to bat for me. I don't know. I'm just feeling really discouraged by all this. I kind of feel like I'm stuck in the middle of a bad decision that I've already sunk too much time and money into to quit now.

What would you suggest is my best course of action?
