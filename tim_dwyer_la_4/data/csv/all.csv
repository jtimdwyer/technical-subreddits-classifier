**Notable Box Office Stories:**

* **Solo: A Star Wars Story** \- Normally on a holiday weekend I wait until Tuesday so I can discuss the full scope of how the extra day off affected the major releases. But the results for Solo were so shocking I frankly couldn't wait and wanted to get at that juicy analysis asap.  tracking to open at the worst over $100M for the three\-day weekend may now not even crack $100M after a four day holiday as Solo: A Star Wars Story opened to #1 with $83.3M. It's been strange because I've seen a lot of couching for this number, that it's soft or underwhelming. Let me be more blunt then, this number right here is bad. Really, really, really bad. How bad? Well first off remember Justice League, the megaflop from last year? That film carried a similar budget of around $300M \(Solo's estimates are all over the map with Disney reporting $250M while Deadline reports $300M\+\) and was also a film that was basically shot twice under two different sets of directors. Well that film, for all its woes, opened at $93.8M, a full $10M higher than Solo. Then there's the comparisons to other Disney era Star Wars films. No one expected the spin\-offs to do as well as the episodic ones but compared with Rogue One, Solo is just pitiful. Rogue One opened 46&amp;#37; higher than Solo with $155M and that was in December when films are supposed to be flipped from the usual summer release strategy of opening really big to cushion big drops in the coming weekends. Not to mention that Star Wars has always been much more of a domestic pull then other more lucrative international properties like the MCU and the Fast &amp; Furious films, which brings us to the even worse news.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)** \- International was probably never going to save this film but the results are far far worse than everyone predicted as the film opened to a miserable $65M overseas, making the worldwide opening a miserable $148.8M. The film couldn't even crack the best international numbers of the weekend, as Deadpool 2 out grossed it by earning $67M on its second weekend. To put that in context Rogue One opened to $134.9M overseas and Justice League opened to $185M. In fact you can just look at[ the list of overseas openings](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/weekend/opening/) \(thanks u/Greede for showing me that list\) and see the many box office disappointments that opened better, including: The Mummy \($140.7M\), Pacific Rim Uprising \($122.4M\), Thor: The Dark World \($109.4M\), 300: Rise of An Empire \($88.8M\), Wrath of the Titans \($76.1M\), and fellow Disney megabomb alum John Carter \($70.6M\). Every Star Wars film seems to set a new low in China and this one took the cake opening there to just $10.1M \(Rogue One opened to $30M\). Guess disguising the film under the title ""Ranger Solo"" in China didn't really help with the country's continued disinterest in the franchise. As it stands not only will Solo be the only Disney era Star Wars film to not crack $1B, it could very well earn less worldwide than Rogue One made domestically \(and note it has already opened lower worldwide than Rogue One opened domestically\). That is terrible no matter what way you slice it.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)**  \-  So what the hell happened here? While the film got worse reviews then Last Jedi the fan vibe seems to be more generally positive including a solid A\- score on Cinemascore. Of course there was the very public firings of original directors, Chris Miller and Phil Lord, and the complete reshooting of the film which ballooned the budget to such catastrophic proportions. That change also meant marketing took a while to finally roll out, all while trying to compete against bigger and splashier ad campaigns like Avengers and Deadpool. Star Wars fatigue could certainly be a thing with less than six months in between the last two films and following up a very divisive film at that. The main takeaway for me though is there is no damn reason that a spin\-off movie should cost more than a main movie. Solo potentially being one of the most expensive films of all time is insane because by its very nature the work is disposable, an ad on, DLC. It should be a fun addendum, not must see material that demands the kind of massive crowd size reserved for the splashiest of releases.
* **Solo: A Star Wars Story \(cont.\)**  \-   Where Lucasfilm goes from here is going to be very interesting. There's blessedly more space between Solo and Episode IX with a full year and change. The episodes also don't feel as directly threatened. The more curious ones will be the Obi Wan movie by Stephen Daldry and the recently announced Boba Fett movie by James Mangold. The latter director in particular is well known for delivering good earning and audience beloved hit films like Logan on time and under budget which is exactly what Star Wars needs right now. Solo is arguably the biggest single character draw of the franchise and the fact the general public reacted so incredibly ambiguously to Solo should be extremely worrisome for Disney. It shows name alone will not drive sales and it already feels like the other spin\-off movies that are coming are horribly out of date before they even begin principal photography. Disney/Lucasfilm needs to take a real hard look at the future of this Star Wars cinematic universe because I don't think they ever expected to have potentially one of the biggest box office bombs of all time by just their fourth release.

TIFU By Powerbombing A Girl,236,3304,False,False,False,tifu,1527514261.0,True,"Obligatory this happened Saturday and not today.

So a girl I've been dating and I went back to my place to hang out, and while there things got a bit hot and heavy. We started making out and I had this bright idea to pick her up and push her against a wall. So I grab her under her thighs and she holds onto my shoulders and lean her up against a wall.

All was going great until the stars aligned and we both decided to become assertive at the same time. I backed us away from the wall so we could drop back down onto my bed, while at the same time \(according to her\) she decides to let go of me so she could push me onto the bed herself. What transpired was that I backed her away from the wall while only supporting her by her thighs, and she lets go of me and expects to use the wall for support as she gets down. So unfortunately I end up dropping her on her back and head from standing height onto my concrete\* floors.

I apologized profusely and was extremely embarassed, but luckily she couldnt stop laughing while only having a minor headache and theorizing how bad my anxiety would be if I had to call an ambulance over because some girl in only her underwear was passed out bleeding from the back of her head.

tl;dr tried to be sexy, instead almost knocked a girl out cold.

Edit: since people keep asking. Stained concrete. Looks like this: https://imgur.com/gallery/8YcpZyS

I know I'm late to the party but Terry Pratchett is brilliant.,165,973,False,False,False,books,1527531461.0,True,"I'm currently reading *Small Gods.* It's the fourth Pratchett book I've read. I read *Good Omens* because I'm a Neil Gaiman fan and I thought it was alright. Then once Pratchett passed away I thought, ""Well, better see what all the fuss over Discworld is about."" I read *The Color of Magic* and *The Wee Free Men* and thought they were fun send\-ups of the fantasy genre. 

A friend recommended *Small Gods* so I picked it up for some relaxing summer reading. But I can't take it to the beach because I always need a pen nearby to take notes. It's like watching Monty Python or History of the World for the first time again, with its biting satire on religion, politics, and philosophy. Reading it, I picture Pratchett with just a desk full of one\-liners and metaphors jotted on scraps and post\-its, working them in between his characters, stories, and dialogue.   


Here are some of my favorites so far:  


""Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you.""  


""There are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal, kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do.""  


""Fear is a strange soil. Mainly it grows obedience like corn, which grows in rows and makes weeding easy. But sometimes it grows the potatoes of defiance, which flourish underground.""

""People think that professional soldiers think a lot about fighting, but *serious* professional soldiers think a lot more about food and a warm place to sleep, because these are two things that are generally hard to get, whereas fighting tends to turn up all the time."""

(5 min read) Why Mourinho's staffing changes could be as important as summer transfers,75,979,False,False,False,reddevils,1527522091.0,True,"# Contrary to popular belief...

Tactics under Mourinho have rarely been a problem, the main matches I can say with certainty that Mourinho set his team up *tactically* in a way that was clearly incorrect were drawing at **Liverpool** away \(Anfield is never a place you can take lightly, however Liverpool were in the midst of a mini\-crisis and were there for the taking\) and both legs against **Sevilla** \(full disclosure: I've never believed that the 4\-2\-3\-1 was the correct formation to get the best out of the current United team and I have my own tactical preferences in world football, but I'm not going to label every game in which Jose utilised 4\-2\-3\-1 as ""tactically poor"" because that would be ridiculous and false\). In both of those games, there was a clear disconnect between the best course of action to earn points/progress through the CL and the way that Mourinho set his team up to play. In fact, both instances were borderline cowardly given the respective circumstances.

The majority of United's problems this season came from their inability to play any sort of cohesive football at pace. Some \(a lot\) of that is down to personnel  \(there were a lot of inconsistent performers in the team this season and the fullback play, while greatly impressive given who the players were, was less than incredible\), but notwithstanding player errors/poor performance, much of the fact that the United team couldn't play football at a high enough intensity to successfully break down and kill off the opposition comes down to two major problems: overall fitness and the content of training sessions.

# Fitness

Mourinho at United \(and in the past at other clubs\) has had a simple strategy to keep his players fit and fresh throughout the season: don't make them run. I know that sounds ridiculous, but the goal for United is to cover the least amount of ground possible during a game in order to save their legs which results in the statistic of United being one of the teams which has covered the least distance in the entire league over the course of a season \(which it has been in 16/17 and 17/18\).

The logic is as follows: when the team has possession of the ball and isn't pressed, the players can afford to rest with it. As long as they have ""control"" \(one of Mourinho's favorite words when analysing a game\), they can afford to recover a bit, which makes sense when you think about it. However, with advances in player fitness and sports science over the years, this extreme level of conservatism isn't fully needed. While it is good to have a built\-in plan during the game to save your players' legs for the higher\-intensity matches, to do so at such an extreme length is neglecting the physical capabilities of the modern day footballer. This is one reason why at times it appears as if United is playing at a saunter. Mourinho this season has voiced his displeasure at the levels of fitness of his team \(although once again some of this comes down to instruction\) which is why he is reportedly bringing in **Stefano Rapetti**, a current fitness coach at Sampdoria\* who Mourinho previously worked with at Inter. Fitness and intensity are obviously very much linked, and so this appointment could be a big stride toward a faster paced style of play on the ball.

# Coaching staff and training sessions

I am surprised when I find out that many fans don't realize the most top level managers generally do not plan and run their own training sessions. The manager is of course still responsible for selecting an overall tactical style, what the team will work on in a given day in training, and will observe sessions and offer his own coaching points, but the majority of the actual planning and the execution of football training sessions at the highest level is often left to the coaching staff \(there will always be exceptions and \(bald\) control freaks, of course\). United this season have often found it hard to get up to full speed until they have already gone down in a match, something that could possibly be attributed to a lack of adequate practice at this intensity.

When the other team punches you in the teeth, you can use that emotional response to ramp up the intensity \(second half vs. City, FA Cup SF vs. Spurs\), but I believe many fans would agree that United need to learn to do so from the get go rather than waiting for disaster to strike to stop them from meekly coasting forward under the assumption that ""I'm sure we're good enough to nick a goal for the 1\-0 win eventually"". These struggles often come down to a lack of high intensity situations replicated in training. Jose has voiced his frustration multiple times over the players' reactions to the training sessions, most notably during his presser after the 2\-0 FA Cup win over Brighton in which he bemoaned the style of play after a week of match preparation focusing on quick build up and attacking play. While it is easy to read this as a very conspicuous jab at his squad \(and to a degree it was\), Jose Mourinho is an intelligent enough man to realize that clearly, something wasn't working. The coaching staff that had remained relatively unchanged for most of his career was unable to prepare his team in the way in which Mourinho wanted to do so, and one of the most stubborn men in football had to admit it was time for a change. This was reflected by Mourinho's quote after the confirmation of Rui Faria's departure:

&gt;“I am going to improve my staffing in the performance level in relation to the fitness and the relation with the tactical work. So I’m going to bring some people in.”

So steps up **Kieran McKenna,** current U18s head coach and ex\-Spurs youth coach \(there is no ""manager"" at the academy and reserve level, although Nicky Butt is the Head of Youth Coaching\), has been reported over the last few weeks to be joining the first team coaching staff to help bring fresh ideas and training methods to the senior squad. His academy side have been known for their fast\-paced, free\-flowing attacking football, scoring goals in bunches and marauding to the U18 PL North title before losing the national final to South champions Chelsea \(although United were missing players\) in a match that was much closer than the 3\-0 scoreline suggests. McKenna is a firm believer of club tradition, and has done a remarkable job developing youth When he was asked to elaborate after stating he wanted his team to play ""the United way"", here is what he had to say:

&gt;""It’s something we emphasise to the boys, especially at this level, with a mindset of not taking a backward step but always looking to take the  game to the opposition, to score goals and show their talents. They’ve  managed to do that for most of the time and it’s something that will be  reinforced to the next group coming in again. It is a thread the club is  very proud of and something we want to continue."" \(Interview with manutd.com\)

Even though McKenna won't be in charge of overall tactics \(which as I mentioned earlier, aren't the main issue\), he already has experience designing sessions for a high intensity, modern style of play. If he is in charge of a session, it is guaranteed to be quality. There is a reason why United were so ecstatic to prize him away from Spurs and his unequivocal success and subsequent rise to the first team justify that excitement. Jose Mourinho's acceptance of a coach who only turned 32 a couple of weeks ago speaks volumes about this young man's potential and footballing brain. In fact \(personal crazy theory time\), I believe that it's possible McKenna is seen by United's board as a long\-term successor to Mourinho. After SAF retired, the collapse was swift and decisive, so much so that United are very clearly still recovering from it on the pitch. In a bid to prevent a similar situation when Jose Mourinho \(one of the most successful managers in modern football\) leaves, they could be attempting to groom McKenna by having him gain experience in the first team. He is clearly very highly rated by everyone at the club, and with a potential 30\+ years left in coaching and management, to already be gaining experience coaching first team football for one of the biggest clubs in the world is quite the accomplishment.

# Conclusions to be drawn from the changes

All in all, Jose Mourinho is not fundamentally going to change and reinvent himself as a manager \(although that would be one of the craziest stories in sporting history if he does\), but that isn't what needs to happen for United to win trophies and look good in the process. In addition to furthering recruitment and advancing the squad toward his ideal this summer, these two coaching changes are very significant. My biggest worry is the impact that the World Cup will have on the upcoming season's preparations. Mourinho, McKenna, Rapetti, and the rest of the staff not having a full preseason with the entire squad is a huge blow to the magnitude of the impact the staffing changes could have. Even so, it is easy to be optimistic about these changes which should both increase the players' physical capacity to play high intensity football as well as practice and develop the instinct and know\-how to do so regularly from the beginning of a match.

\* EDIT: Originally stated Rapetti to be a fitness coach at Genoa, which is incorrect. Edited to reflect his actual position as a Sampdoria fitness coach."

It was really touching, until he vaulted from that 3 minute story into a 10 minute sermon about how the ultimate sacrifice was Jesus on the cross and making it out like we can't recognize and appreciate the sacrifice of the men and women who have died in service to our country without accepting Jesus love and being Christian...

So frustrating, I need to get the hell out of small towns...

Edit: as it's been pointed out in the comments, the title should have said dead military or service members, apologies to all non-army folks I may have offended."

I was seen as nothing but a baby maker and it was humiliating,169,1119,False,False,False,TwoXChromosomes,1527518960.0,True,"So let me start by saying I’ve always been a big /vocal advocate for not asking women about having children unless they start the conversation or even assuming they want children, period. But yesterday I was put in the most mortifying, defenceless situation I’ve ever experienced around this conversation.

My mother in retired after 30 years so me and my husband flew across the county to attend her party. It was a huge party with 101 other guests and they had the five of us in her family set at a head table in front of the room (which is already a little uncomfortable for me). Then the speeches begun. MILs former boss, who I’ve never met, gets up to speak and during it looks straight at me and says now all MIL needs to fully enjoy her retirement is grandchildren. The whole room then looks directly at me and starts clapping and laughing. I can’t emphasize enough that none of these people really even know me, and only about ten had even met me before. I was absolutely humiliated and could do nothing but sit there, fake a smile, and hope they moved on soon.

Well of course, wouldn’t you know after that I was not a human being anymore. I had four different women come up to me, tap me on the shoulder and not even introduce themselves or say hi, they simply said “you better give MIL those grand kids she wants now.” To make matters worse, in a room of 101 people only one person bothered to ask me what I did for a living and only one who already knew asked me how work was going. 2 people. Even when standing next to my husband and brother in law when they would be asked what they do and about work, I simply wasn’t. 

It frustrates me to no end that people still think this type of conversation and behaviour is appropriate and not hurting anyone. For all these people knew maybe I mis carried last week, maybe I don’t want kids, or maybe one of us just found out we were infertile. It’s simply just not okay. "

"CMV: As we celebrate Memorial Day, people don't realize that the United States military hasn't actually fought to defend our freedom since 1945, and most of our military deaths since then were sadly fighting for other reasons.",174,487,False,False,False,changemyview,1527534168.0,True,"I'll start off by saying that I think it's honorable for one to serve and want to defend their country and freedom.  However, since the conclusion of the Second World War, the line between ""defending my freedom"" and ""defending corporate interests and other political interests"" has become awfully blurry.  Our military engages in these conflicts all around the globe, and I keep being told that our service people are ""fighting for my freedom"", but I can't help but wonder what rights of mine are being defended by fighting in foreign countries overseas.

Let's take a recap of all the major conflicts since the Second World War:

* **Korean War** \- what freedoms of mine were defended by fighting in that war?
* **Vietnam War** \- what freedoms of mine were defended by fighting in that war? We ended up losing anyways, so it was a pointless waste of billions of dollars, 50k\+ American lives, and millions of Vietnamese lives on both sides.
* **Desert Storm** \- what freedoms of mine were defended by fighting in that war? \(You \*might\* be able to convince me that that was necessary because letting Saddam control too much of the world's oil supply would be a major risk to national security.\)
* **Iraq War** \- How was Iraq in 2003 a threat to the United States, and what rights of mine were protected by invading a foreign country that had not attacked us?
* **Afghanistan/War on Terror** \- Its been going on for 17 years now, and global terrorism has increased dramatically since then.  All the war on terror has done is create more terrorists. People usually don't take too kindly to their governments being destabilized, their homes being destroyed, and their friends and family getting killed in drone strikes that hit the wrong target.  The reason why Bin Laden was trying to attack the USA, was not because he ""hated freedom"".  Rather, he was tired of the USA constantly meddling in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and wanted the American military presence in his native Saudi Arabia gone.  We wouldn't even need to fight off terrorists, if we weren't meddling in other countries' business in the first place.

I know it's such a taboo subject because people don't want to appear that they are shaming people who are willing to sacrifice in service of their country, but frankly, not many of the military deaths in the past 70 years have been defending my freedom at all.

And I'll also add that I'm not blaming the individual service people for fighting in these wars, as it's the policy makers at the top of the chain of command who are the ones who choose to send our men and women to fight and die on foreign soil.

Somehow I get to really deeply enjoy food more than I ever have, but this is somehow making me healthier and healthier. By eating absurdly delicious food to satiety I've gone below my high school weight, am effortlessly maintaining and just look better and better each month. Mental health is fantastic -- tons of focus and memory improvements, I sleep better (and need less), plenty of energy whenever I need it, stable mood, etc.

Digestive issues, heartburn, and allergies somehow are just completely gone.

Somehow I've achieved all this by eating the best food I've ever had over and over, as much as I want (usually not much, I fill up quick these days). Food that doesn't make me tired, sick, or bloated afterwards. It feels like a combination of indulgent comfort food and feel-better health food. Also I legitimately can't eat too much even if I want to -- there's a shutoff switch and then I just don't want food again for 6-8 hours.

Then there's the fact that vegetables taste like fruit used to. Dark leafy greens taste awesome, dark chocolate tastes sweet (and rich) instead of bitter. Tomatoes are like oranges, cucumber is like watermelon, bell peppers are like apples.

I have yet to count or restrict calories. I started at 300, lost almost *HALF* my weight eating just the fattiest most indulgent foods imaginable.

This hasn't been anything like a diet experience at all. I'm not hungry, don't feel restricted, don't feel tempted by non-diet foods. I don't have to stick through it in the short term to get long-term benefits because by the end of week 1, I felt so good in the short-term I didn't even care about the long-term anymore. Yet here I am 2.5 years later and everything is just awesome. :)"

First of all, Mercy is the reason you see Widowmaker in almost every game in OWL. If Widowmaker's babysitter wasn't in every single game, her pick rate would drop substantially. It's not about Widow - it's about Mercy.

Second, Widowmaker should (arguably) be in every single game because of her skill requirements. This subreddit constantly complains about low skill heroes being bad for the competitive scene, but wants to nerf one of the most mechanically demanding heroes in the game because she's played a lot? The most demanding heroes *should* be played a lot. The game *should* be designed so high skill heroes aren't easily accessible at the lower ranks, but played most often at the high ranks. It's an embarrassment that Ana is barely played in OWL but Mercy is at must-pick status. Don't put Widowmaker in that same boat where she gets nerfed and replaced by Junkrat as the most picked dps.

Widowmaker does not need a nerf."

"I'd like a game show where teams debate a controversial topic, but aren't allowed to openly pick a side and only gain points after arguing for and against. Where the objective is to properly understand both sides.",62,851,False,False,False,CasualConversation,1527516017.0,True,"So an example debate might be ""Euthanasia"" but rather than having two teams being ""For"" and ""Against"", there could be a number of teams and each one would have to put forward arguments for AND against the topic.

The current ideas I had are:

 * Points could be scored for:
* Making good points
* Successfully arguing other team's points
* Bonus points for making particularly good points or defending from another team's argument.

 * Points could be lost for:
* Showing bias by only arguing for one side 
* Lying or spreading inaccuracies (False statistics etc.).

 * Points could be scored by arguing for and against, but only after successfully arguing both sides.
* So each point arguing FOR a topic gives -1 point, but if you also have a point AGAINST the topic, they cancel and give 2 points.
* Bonus points would be tracked differently

The fact that people would need to remain unbiased while still remaining competitive would mean every argument would need to be airtight or it would be picked apart. People wouldn't be happy to let bad arguments survive simply because they are on the same ""side"".

There would probably be a panel of relevant experts deciding whether a team's argument is valid, and penalising lies and correcting inaccuracies. Maybe have one person from each side of the argument but they're not revealed until the end, and they might even discuss their favourite points from the side opposing their own. There might even be bonus points for correctly guessing which is which.

The winner would be decided by points and rather than either topic being considered the winner, people would use the arguments to decide for themselves.

What do you guys think?

---

I always keep my political opinions to myself when I'm discussing them with others and I was wondering what a gameshow like this would be like. I like it because people don't know if I'm on their side or not, so I find they work harder on their arguments rather than just countering what I say."

"Just kicked cancers butt, now I've got a bigger problem.",391,5376,False,False,False,personalfinance,1527483222.0,True,"So, first, some background. I'm currently employed by Walmart. I was a DSD associate, was working full time making 11/hr. I'd been living relatively comfortably \(well, I was never late or worried about my bills, which is the best you can hope for while working for Walmart\). Then I got diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma back in August. Doctor said that it would take about 6 months of chemo to cure it. I hadn't enrolled in the long term disability, nor the improved short term disability, nor the cataclysmic insurance. I just had the basic health insurance with a $6,800 out of pocket maximum. The basic short term disability is $200/week maximum.

Ok, now into the meat of things. My short term disability ran out at the start of May. I just finished up my last treatment on May 21st. I managed to scrape enough money together to make my car payment. I canceled my Hulu, netflix, Amazon prime, etc. I haven't been able to make any  payments on my medical bills, and they're basically all in collections. I lost my apartment back in March and am currently living with my mother, who really can't afford to support me on a waitresses pay. I still have 3 or 4 weeks of radiation therapy to go through before I'm completely done. So, against the wishes of both of my oncologists, I'm going to work through the radiation treatments. However, I don't have my old position anymore, as my fmla leave ran out in January. And I have several complications from the chemo that are going to make returning to work less than pleasant. But I don't have any real choice in the matter. I have to pay for my car, insurance, cell phone, and the gas to drive to the treatments \(which at about 42 miles round trip, 5 days a week won't be insignificant\). On top of all of that, I have about $5,500 in credit card debt, as I had to live off of credit cards, since the short term disability payments were just barely enough to pay my basic bills.

TL;DR: I have $13,000 in medical debt, $5,500 in credit card debt, and like $18,000 in student loans. Won't be able to work full time for about 2 or 3 months.

I need some suggestions. I have no idea what to do. I'm not against filing bankruptcy, but I don't have the money to file for it right now.

Edit: Wow, I did not expect this much support. I'll be replying to more comments later today when I'm back on my computer. First time making the front page as well. Just incredible. Thank you everyone replies.

Edit #2: Ok, I'm finally home and in front of my computer again. Since it would take forever to reply to all the comments, I'll answer a few of the commonly asked questions up here.

SSA/SSD: As soon as I had gotten diagnosed back in August and was told they wouldn't have me working through chemo, I applied for it. I was denied, I appealed, and my most recent appeal was denied about 2 weeks ago, and by the time I'd hear back from another appeal, it would be too late, and it would likely end up getting denied again. Trust me, if I'd gotten approved, none of these financial problems would exist.

Social Worker\(s\): I've actually been in contact and working with social works both in the clinic that I go to for my treatments, as well as one that's employed by my health insurance. They've been doing what they can to help me by finding resources, but one of the problems is the area that I live in isn't very well serviced by very many charitable foundations. The LLS ran out of money for my area, and the ACS has a big gaping hole in coverage in Ohio. 

Credit Cards: I have 4 credit cards. All of them are past due on their payments, but not by more than a month. None of them are in collections yet, only the medical bills from last year are. 

Car: I have a reliable old '07 Impala with 173k miles on it that I bought for $4k and still owe just over $2k on, and I'm still in good standing with them as that was my highest priority bill. I qualify for a deferment through them as I've been paying for over a year without having a single late payment. 

Student Loans: These are what I'm least worried about. I'm currently on an Income\-Based Repayment Plan with them and because I haven't really had an income, I don't need to make any payments. 

Currently my biggest worry is getting through these next 2\-3 months until I'm cleared to go back to work full time while doing as little \(more\) damage to my credit as I can. I'd been on a really good track before all of this happened. I went from like a 560 credit score to a 690 in the course of about 2 years, only to see it plummet again from all this debt accumulation. I've always been a self\-reliant type and hate asking for help, but this ordeal has basically made me suck up my pride and ask for it anyways. 

GoFundMe: I do have one set up, but posting it is against this subreddits policy, so I'm not going to publicly share it here or in the comments. If you want it, you can message me. But My primary goal with this post was to get advice, not a handout. 

So thank you again to all of your comments and suggestions, and I'll try to keep up with all of it as much as I can. I never in my life expected to get this big of a response from a post like this."

[The Office] Kelly always ate Erin’s lunch (S6E1) because Erin was still labeling her lunch as “Kelly.”,25,833,False,False,False,FanTheories,1527514187.0,True,"Not really a deep or meaningful theory, but just something little I came up with.

The Office S6E1, “Gossip,” follows Michael’s attempts to start rumors about everyone in the office to detract from the fact that he told everyone about Stanley’s affair. In a throwaway line, when Michael tells receptionist Erin Hannon that Kelly Kapoor has an eating disorder, Erin says, “She always eats my lunch.”

We found out in Season 5 that Erin’s first name is actually Kelly and that her middle name is Erin. I think that it took some getting used to for Erin to adjust to her “new name,” and so when she packed her lunch each morning she labeled it “Kelly.” As a result, Kelly thought it was her food and ate it.

I know this is probably unlikely because it’s just meant to show that Kelly doesn’t really care about whose lunch is whose (and also because she’d definitely notice eating a lunch she didn’t pack.) But it’s just a little theory that resulted from my rewatching the show close to a dozen times. :)"

Alright, so this one didn't happen to me, but to my father. In his 40's, after a few years spent raising a family \(yes, it was my mother working, yes that's unusual\), he decided to start studying something new: law. He had quite a lot of experience in that field, and decided to back it up with a diploma.

So here he is, quadra guy , had already given a few classes \(really not that many\) around the country and even one or two in that university \(another department though\), walking into the classroom with his computer. First of all, everybody suddendly fell silent when he entered, then they started whispering loudly when he sat somewhere in th middle chairs.

Then the real teacher came in, and this is \(as best as we both remember\) it went on:

D will be my dad, T will be the teacher

T: What are you doing here sir?

D: Well, I took this class.

T: You can't be here, this is only for students of the university.

D: I payed the fees, gave all the papers, signed everything, so I guess I am a student here.

It went on for a long minute before the teacher gave up. But it didn't end there. WHen he got out of the classroom, in the corridor, another teacher \(T2\) caught him:

T2: You must be the new teacher! Nice to meet you. Come get a coffee!

D: SOrry I have to go to my next class \(he didn't understand wtf was happening again\)

T2: The students can wait, don't worry!

D: I'm a student, I'll go and wait.

And again what? yada yada. This was the professor for his next class, so he did wait.

That was all for that day, but he had a few more adventures linked to his age while being there. It all went for the best, and the other students took to call him a french equivalent of papi and joke around about it. A few years later, he gave classes there, and some still called him that."

Confidence victory: Getting unsolicited advice in the gym,32,388,False,False,False,xxfitness,1527526790.0,True,"I’ve read a lot of posts on here about people who give unsolicited advice in the gym.. and while I’ve never had to deal with it up until recently, all those posts gave me some good ammo when I was confronted on 2 separate occasions by the same person. So, thank you xxfitness! I just wanted to share my experience in case any of you have trouble saying something to these types of people.

Background on the guy: I see him at the gym all the time. Probably early 20s, lost a lot of weight, and is studying to be a personal trainer. Talked to him a few times and he’s quite nice.

Last weekend I was doing wide grip bench. He stopped me mid set and said “your grip is really wide. Do your wrists hurt? Maybe you should make your grip more narrow. You can hurt your shoulders like that.” I just responded something like “no my wrists are fine, I’m retracting my shoulder blades, and I’m doing wide grip bench” and put my headphones back in. Clearly irritated but I’m sooo not confrontational so I just shrugged it off.

THEN.. just yesterday I was doing tricep pushdowns and he interrupted me YET AGAIN to tell me that my wrists weren’t straight and I could get carpal tunnel and I’m not activating my triceps. More annoyed this time, I replied with “I can feel my triceps activating just fine thank you.” I finished my set, but became increasingly annoyed.

Here’s where it gets good.. I went back over to him when he was done with his set and here’s how the conversation went

Me: “just curious, why are you so focused on my workout instead of your own?” 
Dude bro: “ I do it to everyone. If they’re doing something wrong, I tell them.”
Me: “ok I see people doing things wrong all the time, but I’m not going around being the form police. I would only give advice if someone asked me and I didn’t ask you. I’ve been doing this for 4 years with no injuries and have a pretty good idea of what I’m doing. And honestly it makes me really uncomfortable to know that you’re watching me work out, so can you stop?”
Dude bro: “ok sorry, I won’t do that.”

Success.

My voice was shakey that entire conversation, but it had to be said. I felt liberated that I stood up for myself and said something. This is completely out of character for me. A lot of people already feel self conscious in the gym, and knowing someone is watching you that intently is just downright creepy. Just because he’s studying to be a PT, doesn’t give him the right to do that to random people. I hope he reconsiders giving advice to others based on our conversation.

TLDR: I’m a non-confrontational introvert that gained the courage and confidence to tell dude bro to stop watching me workout and giving unsolicited advice. You can do it too!

&gt;Dean Takahashi, Venturebeat, **May 6, 2016**: EA DICE’s lead designer answers our questions about Battlefield 1

&gt;GamesBeat: What’s your position on the project?

&gt;Daniel Berlin: I’m lead game designer.

&gt;GamesBeat: When things started leaking a bit, **people were positioning this as an alternate history of World War One. Is there any alternate history to this, or is it purely historical?**

&gt;&gt;Berlin: **It’s definitely rooted in history. There’s no alternate mix of anything else. All the stuff you see is equipment that was available. All the vehicles you see were available at this time.**

&gt;GamesBeat: No time travel?

&gt;&gt;Berlin: No time travel. This is our depiction through a modern lens, looking at World War One, the Great War.

&gt;GamesBeat: How many concessions do you have to make for the sake of gameplay? Back then tanks were extremely slow, and they didn’t come in until 1917. Reloading took a while. Lots of things would bog down the pace of the battle.

&gt;&gt;Berlin: Like I say, for us gameplay is king. We need to make sure the vehicles and weapons are fun to use. With the variety of stuff that’s available, we can push and keep the pace you see in previous Battlefield games. We can also deliver the kind of rock-paper-scissor gameplay you’re familiar with. It’s a good fit. I know that’s surprising to a lot of people, but it’s been so fun to be on this journey and learn so much.

&gt;Matt Purslow, pcgamesn, **14 Jun 2016**: Battlefield 1 scrapped female soldiers because boys don’t believe in them, says ex-DICE coder 

&gt;Update 13 Jun, 2016: Dice have since confirmed that the game will feature a female protagonist in the female campaign in an interview with Eurogamer. Creative director Lars Gustavsson stated in no uncertain terms regarding female soldiers in Battlefield 1’s multiplayer **“No, not in multiplayer. Just in single-player.”**

&gt;She went on to tweet that DICE eventually explained to her that the real reason for female soldiers being withdrawn from the game was that the core audience of boys could believe that the way tanks and parachutes in the game worked was accurate, but couldn’t believe that women soldiers were. 

&gt;That, combined with the added expense of creating new models and voices for women soldiers would make the game pricey, apparently. 

&gt;Coget believes this choice is down to DICE making an assumption about their audience and what’s “credible”.

&gt;Samit Sarkar, Polygon, **Oct 31, 2016**: EA turns horrors of WWI into tone-deaf Battlefield 1 memes, quickly deletes them (update)

&gt;Maybe don’t put a hashtag on World War I

&gt;Battlefield 1 publisher Electronic Arts — and specifically, **the game’s social media team — is under fire today for a tasteless marketing campaign** in which the series’ **Twitter account came off as glorifying the First World War to sell a video game.**

&gt;EA has since deleted the three tweets in question, which used the hashtag #justWWIthings alongside meme-worthy phrases such as “weekend goals” and GIFs containing violent images from Battlefield 1. 

&gt;The game, which is set during World War I, was released earlier this month.

&gt;Both of those tweets have gone viral this morning, even after EA deleted them. **If you search that hashtag on Twitter right now, you’ll see plenty of people lambasting EA for the marketing campaign.**

&gt;**This also isn’t the first time that EA has deleted an insensitive Battlefield 1-related marketing tweet.** Peter Moore, EA’s chief competition officer, tweeted a photo of himself in a Battlefield 1 onesie last week, saying that “trench warfare requires specialty equipment and clothing.” The garment, said Moore, includes “pockets for melee weapons and Doritos.”

&gt;World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, involved about two dozen nations; estimates put the casualty totals at more than 37 million soldiers and over 7 million civilians, including more than 8.5 million military personnel killed in action.

&gt;Update: An EA representative provided Polygon with the following statement regarding the #justWWIthings campaign: **“We would like to apologize for any offense caused** by content in the last 24 hours posted on the @Battlefield Twitter account. **It did not treat the World War 1 era with the respect and sensitivity that we have strived to maintain with the game and our communications.”**

https://archive.fo/r5JjL

&gt;Jordan Forward, pcgamesn, **25 April 2017**: Battlefield 1 and how to **treat war with respect** in videogames

&gt;Whether to venerate or deplore the struggles of the over 70 million military personnel who were mobilised during World War One is an impossible conundrum.

&gt;... Biplanes zipping around like X-wings, a dubstep remix of Seven Nation Army, men battering each other with shovels and someone being engulfed by a cloud of mustard gas. It’s **a nightmarish cavalcade of tactlessness** - one that’s so far removed from the reality of that conflict that for DICE to claim any semblance of authenticity to it should be out of the question.

&gt;Then there’s Valiant Hearts, ... still being one of the most thoughtful, affecting and uplifting war games ever made. Without a combat mechanic to speak of, Valiant Hearts gives two perspectives of the war and in each one chooses to focus on the human tragedy of it rather than the battlefield experience.

&gt;It’s a similar approach to the one adopted by This War of Mine developers 11 bit Studios. Senior writer Pawel Miechowski tells me about how his team approached the Balkans War...

&gt;“I think the entirety of pop culture trivialises war. On the one hand it's a very thrilling topic, on the other hand, we see it from a distance and forget how horrible an event war is. In the end it somehow happened that as a prolongation of that, pop culture trivialised war. It's happened to a bigger extent in gaming, because at some point war and fighting became a dominant topic. For that, This War of Mine can be considered an antidote, because we presented war in the serious tonality that it deserves.”

&gt;Battlefield 1 appears to be heavily drawing on both of those themes, but in doing so DICE are **bastardising the reality** of the war.

&gt;**Taking some historical liberties is fine, and nobody would expect or want a First World War Battlefield game to rigidly adhere to fact.**

&gt;Then DICE announced Elite classes - think jacked-up, armour-clad knights of yore, wielding 40-pound machine guns while striding around the battlefield like Darth Vader on ‘roids - and **any notion that this was to be a remotely respectful take** on the conflict vanishes amidst the premise of players being able to turn the tide of battle by spawning in as a special trooper. **As DICE tactlessly put it** in their Elite classes announcement post - “Not every soldier is created equally.”

&gt;It’s important not to ignore the elephant in the room: gaming is a form of entertainment. So however uncomfortable Battlefield 1’s approach to World War One might make us, it is just a game, and from what we’ve seen of it, a good game. The problem is that **cherry-picking the best bits of a global tragedy just leaves a sour taste in the mouth. And that’s how we remember the First World War, as a global tragedy.**

&gt;From Call of Duty to Wolfenstein, developers haven’t struggled with creating a tasteful war story because they’ve always had a unanimously despised enemy.

&gt;Even hugely successful **mainstream franchises like Call of Duty and Medal of Honour managed to find a respectful tone** in their games within the most life-consuming conflict in history.

&gt;World War One has no particular filmic legacy to rely on. Likewise, it still strikes an emotional chord with many because it hasn’t had a buffer of media to desensitise audiences to its reality. There’s nothing inherently wrong with Battlefield 1’s choice of setting, although the inclusion of mustard gas grenades - chemical weapons being a war crime and all - is questionable to say the least.

https://archive.fo/3oGhT

&gt;Nick Statt, The Verge, **May 6, 2016**: Everything we know about the WWI-themed Battlefield 1

&gt;**Battlefield 1942 established the franchise’s interest in expansive, real-world conflicts. And its commitment to historical accuracy built upon the popular WWII shooters of that era. So Battlefield 1 is meant to harken back to those glory days.** It's the fifth main Battlefield game, but it's set during the first global conflict of the modern age. Game makers aren't known for taking risky leaps when it comes to branding, so it's a surprise to see EA taking a leap with one of its most celebrated series.

&gt;It's not steampunk-themed or set in alternate history

&gt;When Battlefield 1 leaked earlier today, people saw a cape-clad soldier in front of a giant zeppelin plastered across the backdrop. At first glance, it seemed EA was drawing influence from Bioshock Infinite by giving its early 20th century shooter a steampunk vibe that would lean heavy on airships and reimagined industrial technology.

&gt;Yet EA says the game is drawing from honest historical events. The Germans really did do zeppelin bomb raids, and horses and tanks coexisted on the Western Front. Sure, there was rudimentary hand-to-hand combat and trench warfare, but WWI was also the first major conflict to feature complex air and ground vehicles. EA says designing a game around WWI is a lesson in contrast, and we can see that in Battlefield 1's first trailer.

&gt;T.C. Sottek, The Verge, **Sep 2, 2016**: I wanted to quit Battlefield games forever until I played Battlefield 1

&gt;Shot through the heart, and it feels great

&gt;**Naturally, Battlefield 1** doesn't have years of rooting for Luke Skywalker and Han Solo behind it, but it **does have a rich historical character unlike generic near-future shooter clones. It feels like you're taking part in something authentic, even though it's exceptionally weird and cartoonish** ***at times.*** But that weirdness makes it feel special. I can't think of another game that lets you strafe horses in biplanes, wear steel armor while firing a machine gun from the hip, or blast enemies from an armored train — yet these are all things you can do in the same round of Battlefield 1, and this is just the beta. I can't wait to see what happens when massive zeppelins and other weird weapons of war are added to the mix.

Funnily enough, **the developers, media, and gamers ALL agreed that BF:1 should have some level of authenticity.** Everyone agreed.

So would be quite reasonable to assume that the next Battlefield, set in WW2, would build upon BF:1's claim of at least *some* ""commitment to historical accuracy"" (Nick Statt, The Verge, May 6, 2016: Everything we know about the WWI-themed Battlefield 1) and ""respect and sensitivity"" (EA representative statement to Polygon, Samit Sarkar, Polygon, Oct 31, 2016: EA turns horrors of WWI into tone-deaf Battlefield 1 memes, quickly deletes them (update) ).

""We want historical accuracy"" is essentially the same demand from Battlefield 1, carried over to Battlefield V. The media of that time *supported* this. Still reasonable, yes?

Now add a woman to the trailer, and ""we want historical accuracy"" becomes ""I'm a fucking misogynist!!!"". 

The same statement, framed with a different presentation, has morphed into an entirely different statement.

You'd think a journalist is supposed to report accurately on a fanbase's opinions, minimize controversies, and promote mutual understanding for the benefit of everyone involved.

&gt;Megan Farokhmanesh, The Verge, May 24, 2018: **Battlefield V fans who failed history are mad that the game has women in it**

&gt;**Has anyone here read a book?**

&gt;Online, this infantile cry has rallied around its own hashtag — #NotMyBattlefield — and it is full of users shrieking about political correctness.

&gt;This ugly, familiar line of thinking reared its head before when DICE dared to put a black man on the cover of Battlefield 1. #NotMyBattlefield is more of the same, a chance for these angry contingents to push against what they view as a bastardization of the series. But as the hashtag itself says, it’s not theirs. Battlefield V is yet another example of a game, a movie, a TV show, a cultural touchpoint that young, angry white men want to claim as their own. **Fans have no ownership over the things they love. Battlefield players don’t get to decide what belongs or doesn’t belong in Battlefield V.** As executive producer Aleksander Grøndal said on Twitter, “We will always put fun over authentic.”

&gt;Don’t give us that “historically accurate” crap either. You can’t hide your small-minded misogyny behind it.

&gt;You’re an embarrassment. Go elsewhere. 

A journalist, promoting mutual understanding? Of course not.

Don't mention the frequently-asked question of ""Is BF:V going to be less serious?"", don't mention ""Why is the trailer so shit?"" Don't even bother, don't investigate, don't ask, don't even think.

Why, a media outlet is just like Twitter, so a journalist's job is to misrepresent, insult, and demonize people just to exacerbate controversies for clicks!

Just focus on that **ONE angle** instead: *""WOW LOOK AT THAT MISOGYNY!*"" Fuck bothering to look deeper! This sentiment: https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/8ml9e1/battlefield_v_has_female_characters_because_the/dzoz9gd/ definitely doesn't exist!

&gt;Matthew Gault, Motherbord May 24 2018:'Battlefield' Has Never Been Historically Accurate, That's Why It's Fun

Hilarious!

A simple idea, ""whether a war game shold be more realistic"", after losing it's popularity as a cultural zeitgeist, an totally ""innocent and academic question"" (cough medievalPOC cough), is to be thrown away and mocked once it's gone out of favor. Hmmmmmm!

Fuck ""giving a voice to the voiceless and speaking truth to power"", journalism is about ""being a lazy, predatory bastard, and exacerbating controversies, because **fuck** decency and principles, *I can't give a shit!*""

More hot takes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/8lv6m9/battlefield_v_the_people_complaining_about_a/

**Does anyone really don't want women?**

AFAIK, nobody was butthurt over the female singleplayer protagonist in BF:1. Why? Perhaps, *maybe because it was presented well, so nobody cared?!*

I've seen comments that stress that they aren't hating it just because a woman was added, so surely the actual underlying reason is ""to sell the idea better"". BF:V's shitty trailer, DICE's **aWeSOmE** tweets, and jorunos being trash as usual - is worsening the issue to nobody's benefit.

SJWs are fighting fantastical enemies that don't truly exist (maybe they're happy about that, who knows), and the imperious response from devs and media, only causes detractors to reject all ""diversity"" issues out of hand, because *they were treated like shit the first time round.* Good fucking job.

Again, people didn't like Captain Hook because she's the most obvious of the trailer's Fortnite-like tone, which, to this fucking day, *still isn't explained.*

**Looking Deeper: wtf is EA/DICE doing with their communications:**

If you notice, AFAIK, the only devs that revealed game details were only in youtube interviews.

&gt;Crowbcat, Published on Sep 19, 2016

So are Oskar Gabrielson and Aleksander Grøndal‏ telling me that ""3 men on a horse"" is normal, and I should expect BF:V to be a hot glitchy mess *as a feature...?* :O

With BF:1, lead game designer Daniel Berlin had an interview with VentureBeat, as noted above. And that info is *searchable.*

With BF:V *useful info* is confined to 30min youtube video interviews. You cannot search videos!

Perhaps DICE limiting interviews to youtube, is going direct to their fanbase, which is a good idea, in theory. And no-effort Twitter hot takes are produced for everything else, which is a good idea in theory, since executive producers and general managers are supposed to do the marketing mumbo jumbo.

But, you can't search videos! And they're really long, so any GOOD info is buried *so nobody will see it.* And the Twitter takes, piss people off!

So who is right, Oskar Gabrielson and Aleksander Grøndal on Twitter, and that unethical media articles that everyone loathes? Or Dan Berlin and Lars on youtube?

This is a communications fuckup.

**GAME THEORY, is EA/DICE's responses so far accidental or intentional?**

Let's discount the journalists, whom as we have seen, don't give a fuck.

Now let's look at the dev's communications fuckup, with a theory, a GAME THEORY:

* nobody has any idea wtf they're doing, so an unintentional fuckup

* the fuckup is unintentional, but DICE is trying to get closer to fans, whom they know, ignore media outlets. so everything's on youtube. but they fucked up since videos aren't searchable

* the fuckup is intentional, the tweets are to minimize media backlash (see: Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefront 2) by placating media SJWs with SJW hot takes (this actually worked)

* the fuckup is intentional, the trailer guy KNEW that adding cosmetics would make BF:V a fuckup, despite improved gameplay, ala Team Fortress 2 hat infestation but worse. *The trailer is fucked on purpose* (very fast, chaotic) **as a forewarning to gamers**, and Battlefield devs just have to deal with it because EA wants money, and the money is in microtransactions.

* the fuckup is intentional *and malicious*, someone knew adding cosmetics to BF:V somehow makes it hideous and horrible, so added a woman to the trailer as bait, to provoke a media attack and to deflect attention from BF:V's shortcomings until it's released

* the fuckup is intentional, and it's a big diversity push from EA/DICE because someone's daughter might get salty one day when she plays dad's old game.........?

&gt;Demize99 DICE Design Director -275 points r/Battlefield, 27 May 2018

&gt;&gt;I knew this was going to be a fight when i pushed for female soldiers in Battlefield. I have a daughter, and I don’t want to ever have to answer her question of “why can’t I make a character that looks like me” with “because you’re a girl.”

&gt;&gt;I fundamentally feel to my core this is the right way and I will find myself on the right side of history.

&gt;&gt;And I think many people will play the game despite their reservations. And maybe learn something about either history or themselves. That is part of the making games art.

* some combination of the above, or not at all

Whatever the case, the truth will be revealed once Battlefield V releases on October.

Also, why am I doing a journo's job? Games journalism is garbage.

ID Please,94,2377,False,False,False,pettyrevenge,1527491309.0,True,"Back in the late 90's I used to work across the street from a gas station, and I would go in there all the time to buy smokes.  Although back then most places wouldn't even card a 12 year old, the guy who worked behind the counter was kind of a hard on and carded me every single time.

At the time drivers licenses were laminated paper, and not the hard plastic of today.  The corner on mine was peeling a tiny bit, and he would pick at it every time, like he was inspecting its authenticity.  I kept telling him not to because he was making it worse (this was also before renewing online was a thing and getting a new license involved spending the better part of a weekday at the DOL).  Eventually, over a month or two, he did in fact rip it apart and immediately handed me back the two halves of my license and told me that he couldn't accept it and put the smokes back.

I didn't make a big scene, I knew he would eighty six me and take pleasure in it.  It was what he wanted.  So I left quietly.

After that, whenever I went into the store and grabbed a soda or something from the cooler, I would check the coffee pots, and if they were about half full I would flip the switch to make them brew more coffee.  It would be empty enough to give me ample time to pay and leave before they overflowed all over the floor and counter, but full enough to be sure it made a good sized mess."

I manage a small team of people in the warehouse as their supervisor. One afternoon I was checking on the guys in the warehouse and spotted a SUV parked in the loading bay. I asked who's it was and they said the husband parked it there and never came back to move it.

As it had been parked in the loading zone for hours already several trucks had attempted delivery but had to manually unload down the side of the dock as the SUV was in the way.

I decided to send an email to the wife and husband asking them to politely move the vehicle as it was preventing us from doing our job and I didn't want to see their car get damaged by any trucks unloading in the dock.

The wife responded with a huge rant and rave saying her husband was using the dock to unload and he'd move it when he was finished. 

Mind you the car had been there already most of the day when I sent my email asking them to move it, and it was close to knock off time.

I copied in my manager and replied; my guys knock off at 4 and will close down the dock area and hope the car would be moved before then.

She replied that the car can be parked there all day and it's not harming anyone and if we damaged her car we'd be sued, etc.. etc.. Another long ranting email...

I went back into the warehouse and told my guys to shut down at knock off time which involves bringing the large bins in via forklift into the loading dock and locking the wheels down to stop them rolling out.

We left at 4 with the SUV surrounded by our massive bins with locked wheels.

Let’s just say she was not happy when they finally decided to collect their car, another long ranting email came through while I was home and my manager finally jumped in by replying to the email chain ""Don't park there again if it's inconvenient for you to move the bins after hours""

They've stopped parking in the loading bay ever since.

The last prank call,14,361,False,False,False,TalesFromYourServer,1527522763.0,True,"Kept getting prank calls last night from a group of kids as you could hear them giggling together on the line when they would give a fake name like ""bill Cox"" and place to go orders for rediculous things like ""everything on the menu"". My manager happened to be the victim of their second call this night and since he's a bit more naive to this he spent a good 5 minutes on the phone with them taking their fake order. Mean while we have a routy party of 28 flagging down each FOH staff they can for individual random requests. It's getting late towards closing and we're already short a few servers and have no one in Take Away. After my buddy tells me what's going on with the prank calls in takeaway and how my manager already wasted so much time falling for their most recent call I decided to handle it. I waited in takeaway and sure enough with in a minute an other call was about to come through (you can see inbound callers navigating through the phone tree with our phones). As soon as it rings I pick it up but pause to see if I can maybe catch them then say hello or something first so I can verify its a kids voice and not an actual guest. Thankfully as soon as I answered I could hear a couple kids giggling in the background so I put on a deep voice and said ""Our County's Police department, this is officer Jameson"". (Redacted the actual county name for this post) Immediately heard the giggling stop and the phone went dead on their end. The calls stopped after that. My coworker and I high fived and we're super estatic that it worked"

Failure is always an option,155,3897,False,False,False,sysadmin,1527475441.0,True,"Last week my ex-boss reached out to me about cleaning up a ransomware infection that had taken down his servers (ones that I helped set up years ago). We'd known each other for 18 years and we had worked at multiple jobs together. We were close friends. He was my mentor and I might possibly have been the closest thing he had to a son.

After sharing a bunch of advice to help him with the ransomware infection, I thought he had it under control. He'd successfully restored at least a few of the affected servers from snapshots and the rest he could just do the same way.

He did not have it under control. He felt like a failure. He felt like he'd let everyone down. He had cancer and was in constant pain. The sleep deprivation and the stress from working the outage for multiple days had affected his judgment in profound ways and I had no idea.

At 4am this morning he posted a farewell message on Facebook and then he took his own life.

I'm posting this because I know that there are a lot of us here that regularly get into stressful outage situations. It is a statistical certainty that some of you at some point will not be able to save the day. I want to say to anyone who will listen that when that happens to you, it is OK. I don't care if it's total, catastrophic failure that leads to the company shuttering or innocent people dying. It is OK.

I want to tuck it in the back of your head that you are intrinsically valuable, as you are right now, with or without a career, and no matter how bad something at work gets, you are loved.

When you are in over your head, sleep deprived, and not thinking straight, I want you to remember that in the end, the company and your fellow employees will take care of themselves, and you are entitled to take care of yourself too. Admit failure. Walk off the job if you have to. Take a medical leave if you need it. Call someone you can confide in, whether that's someone close or a total stranger. And please know that no matter what happens at your job, failure is always an option.

Picking up girls at bars 101: sniff their drinks,211,1203,False,False,False,cringe,1527495249.0,True,"My roommate and I went to grab a drink after a pretty mild day. I’ve been meaning to take her to this bar for a while because the vibe is really chill and it’s never disappointed before.

So we’re just standing at the bar talking and she’s taking pictures of the neon signs. Then all the sudden these two guys come up and ask her jokingly if she was taking pictures of him. At first we just laugh it off but then he follows up “I wouldn’t be surprised if you were” instead of just introducing himself like a normal person. 

Neither of us are really interested, but we don’t tell them to go away either and just responded to their questions with short, convo killing answers. At one point, my roommate just stopped talking and went back to taking pictures. After a while of one word answers or “oh I see” , I stopped talking too and just looked away for a good full minute. I guess one of the bartenders noticed because he came over to ask if we needed anything. My roommate straight up looked uncomfortable and I’m trying to find a way to end the convo. At this point, they weren’t weird, we were just not in the mood to be sociable so the convo was pretty one sided. 

I was pretty over it but before I can shut this down for good, one of the guy tries to start up a conversation again and ask me what I’m drinking. After I tell him, he leans down and sniffs my drink and then does the same to my roommate’s. I’m too shocked that this happened to even say anything. Thank god the bartender saw, came over and said “we’ve got extra tokens for skeeball, take some!” 

I snap out of it and was like “YO I LOVE SKEEBALL, THANKS MAN” grab half the tokens, roommate grabs the other half and we booked it. Bartender guy, if you’re on reddit, good looking out my dude.

TL;DR stranger thinks it’s ok to sniff my drink after I tell him what it is."

Pete Vlastelica: ""We are talking to many interest groups in Berlin, but at the same time also in France, Spain and Sweden. At the moment, I can't say which two countries and cities we are going to add. More than anything, the quality of the potential owners is the deciding factor.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. "

Old hippy saved me when I took too much,24,182,False,False,False,Psychonaut,1527528183.0,True,"Usually I can take a tab and do what ever I want.  I like to longboard at the beach and stuff like that usually.  Which is what I was doing.  I decided to go find some isolation bc it was coming on VERY strong in 30 mins.  

So I get down to the quite residential area and a mom and her 2 underage daughters say I look cute and started following me around. I was not doing well.  I was drenched in sweat, was forgetting what was going on, visuals were nauseating, and the girls and her mom kept following me pestering me.  I managed to cut a corner and find some isolation until a couple came and sat down next to me at the beach.  Nobody around and they sat next to me.  So I left and decided I wanted to sit on a parking garage.  

At this point the setting around me is completely dominating my thoughts. The street lights didn't come on and it was pitch black, never seen it like this.  I couldn't here anything, felt like everyone was trying to be quite.  Felt like the power was off in the city bc most hotel and store lights were off.  People kept walking away from the beach.  Fire truck after fire truck was screaming by.  I almost ran and asked someone WTF was going on and where the bunker was.  Thought we were under attack from the sea.  I snapped out of that dangerous thought loop and realized I needed to get the fuck inside away from people, reality was collapsing and I was not doing well.  

Made my way to this hippy music shop.  They play live music.  I sat down and there was a dude rapping from the islands.  It was so deep.  I'd sat down right when they were closing.  They could clearly see how fucked up and scared I was. Nobody said anything but they closed the gate so nobody else could see the music and told some others to leave.  A old as hippy looked at me and got on stage.   Said he was tired from going all night but he'd play a few more.  Dude played ""Can't you see"" - Marshall Tucker Band. 

 I started swirling out of reality.  He was playing the song looking at me the whole time.  I heard voices saying ""what are you running from"" and the wind felt like it picked up, felt like I was about to fucking explode, i was dissapating in the air, I was melting in my.seat.  I felt a cacoon of energy surrounding me.  I could feel my eyes rolling in the back of my head.  Pure euphoria I teared up.  I could feel my soul coming out and meeting his.  We would twist and spiral together, weaving into an infinity of shapes and patterns.  Then spiral back into my chair.  Then do it again.  Shit was fucking crazy.  He played a few songs and by that time I could speak again and calmed me down. Felt like I dropped 10k pounds. I can't explain it but it was the best experience of my life. 

Best people ever.  I am just so thankful.  Holy shit.  "

"Please remember: report hackers you encounter in Splatoon 2 using the Nintendo Switch Online app! If you don't know, here's how.",288,2921,False,False,False,NintendoSwitch,1527482460.0,True,"Hey fellow Splatooners, if you're like me until recently, you might be unaware how to actually report a hacker you've encountered (I was until last night). I've run into several now (including a new dualies hack that I hadn't seen before), and it's important that we stay vigilant in making sure we report them. I have no idea what Nintendo does after we do so, or how much effort they put in, but it's important we try nonetheless.

To report a player, access the Nintendo Switch Online app. Go to your Splatoon page, and tap on ""Battles"" in the bottom right. Then, tap on the particular battle where you encountered the hacker. Once you're on that screen, you can tap on the player that you suspect of hacking and tap ""report"" at the bottom. Be as SURE as you can be before reporting this person. We don't want to abuse this feature. 

To summarize the steps:

1. Access the Nintendo Switch Online app, and the Splatoon page.

2. Tap ""battles"" in the bottom right.

3. Tap on the battle that you recall seeing the hacker.

4. Tap on the player and hit ""report"" at the bottom.


Some indications you may have encountered a hacker:

1. The weapon they are using typically has a short range, but is shooting unrealistically far.

2. The weapon they're using traditionally shoots slow, but is now like a machine gun (think a blaster).

3. If you're suspicious, and at the end of the match you see someone with 40 kills while the remainder of the team has 7-10....probably a hacker.

I know hacking is controversial. Keep in mind that NOT ALL hackers are doing so malevolently. If you see only a cosmetic change, like an Octoling, I don't believe that's grounds for reporting, but that is my opinion only. 

It's infuriating when you are trying your best, and yet a hacker comes along and ruins your rank that you just got after 3 straight hours. So let's try to clean up the scene as best we can. And hackers doing so just to get a step ahead of us, just...git gud.
 

EDIT: I do want to be sure that we are not reporting left and right and hurting good people that are just good at the game. I personally have only encountered them in ranked mode, and I reported based on a combination of factors, not a whim of ""wow, he was good. Definitely a cheater."" I also want to say, to incoming players, it is NOT as prevalent as my post would make it seem. It is possible that I was matched with these hackers due to my location and ping. A big majority here can say with honesty they have never seen one. I just wanted to be sure, now that these ""how-to hack"" instructions are public, that we knew how to report if they become a true nuisance."

Things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. One thing led to another and I started fingering her. She was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that I was doing a decent job. A good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. I'm sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. I call her name and start panicingly shaking her. She's not responsive and I slap her face. As soon as I did this she starts having a seizure. Now I'm freaking the out. I jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. I'm about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. She's giving me this wtf just happened look and I tell her what happened. At first she tells me she doesn't believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. She said that when she has a seizure it's best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. I just sat there in that ""thank god I didn't finger a girl to death"" state. Needless to say our sexy time ended right there.

TLDR: I fingered a girl into a seizure. She stops and says it happens sometimes."

One of the best (non mechanical) ways to improve your gameplay is to learn to track the kill feed and develop trigger discipline for your ults,33,219,False,False,False,OverwatchUniversity,1527522495.0,True,"A lot of people think that mechanics are the most important area for improvement that will affect your gameplay but they neglect some of the most important aspects of becoming good at overwatch. 

You will see a huge amount of improvement if you start learning to read the kill feed at the corner of the screen. Keeping track of which team is up in numbers, and communicating that info to the team, is going to help you and your team make better decisions. 

Even in diamond you see players going in and pushing when you are down two players (basically feeding the enemy free ult charge because you will definitely not win the fight). Or how often have you seen your zarya blow her grav when your team is already down 3-4 players and respond with a ""I thought the team was with me!""

It also helps you know when you are up and can push the advantage. ""Guys we are up two, let's push on the!"" is a call out that can win games but requires no mechanical skill.

By reading the kill feed you can make smarter decisions like knowing when to retreat or to save your ult. Announcing it to your team is even better because then no one will blow their ults! ""Zarya don't use grav we are down 3"" or ""Genji you are alone don't use blade, save it for the next fight""

The best part of this is that it is really easy to develope. I learned by forcing myself to say it out loud Every time I see we are up or down a player. You don't even need to know exactly who died or who got the kill. To begin, just focus on the color of the kill feed. If you see blue, say ""we are up one"" if you see red, say ""we are down a player"". Just focus on the color of the feed and saying it every single time and eventually it will become second nature.

If you are on a role that doesn't require as much focus on mechanics like Main tank or support you can even call out which hero died to give your team more info.

Overall, learning to read the kill feed and manage your ults appropriately is going to help you improve a lot at Overwatch!

Edit: It was brought to my attention that torb turrets/shield gen/bongos/junkrat tire ect. all appear on the kill feed. Those situations are pretty niche though and for a beginner it won't make a difference 99% of the time I think.

I hope riot will go in depth on the clash issue like they did years ago on the instant recall bug,80,1324,False,False,False,leagueoflegends,1527506226.0,True,"For those that do not know what I'm talking about, years ago there was a bug that was found first on riven that allowed to recall instantly (that's fast).


At first only riven was disabled but shortly after that people started to reproduce the bug on every champ (even Ao Shin) which led to ranked being disabled for some time across all regions.


Some months after riot released a quite long and very interesting article about the behind the scene of the bug, it wasn't the most technical article but it showed a lot how riot work those issues and it helped everyone understand why one guy sitting in a corner doesn't develop a whole game mode alone in an hour and a half.


I would like to see the same kind of article released in the somewhat near future talking about how clash became crash and how riot worked to make crash become clash again. Showing how things changed inside riot to improve their reactions to this kind of problems and all the behind the scene work being done.

I wrote a script that builds Spotify playlists for me!,31,242,False,False,False,Python,1527519569.0,True,"I'm not super experienced in Python \-\- my main programming language is Java, but I learned Python from a CS course I took last semester.  I love programming, but I also really love hip hop music.  I typically find this music by looking at a website called Hot New Hip Hop, which keeps a list of the top 100 new songs at any given time.  There are a select number of artists who I like, and a lot of the time the tracks are too new to be on Spotify.

To save myself time, I automated my process of searching for and discovering new music.  I used Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a script to run every morning, scrape the top 100 songs page, and add songs to a playlist if they're made by artists I like and are on Spotify.  I also used a SQLite database to store my Spotify client and access tokens, as well as prevent adding duplicate songs.  This script will probably save me about 45 minutes to an hour each week, which is pretty sweet.

As soon as word of the cancellation got around, a bunch of artists stepped up to do *something* about it. 3lau and BoomBox Cartel played several venues and were instrumental in getting a bunch of the after parties set up. Ekali pulled an all nighter; he played tons of venues for free and chilled with his fans until the early morning. Also, an honorable mention to Disco Donnie for trying to salvage what he could. It wasn't his call to shutdown SMF, and he shouldn't get hate for it.

There were several other artists who fought the good fight, but Bonnie x Clyde made the most waves. They started with a meet and greet, then played the official after party, drove all over Tampa performing smaller sets at local bars and small nightclubs, and even threw down at random house parties.

I didn't get to go to all of these events, but I definitely have a new respect for these artists for showing how much they cared for their fans."

Deleted Instagram; Banged Instagram Model,29,124,False,False,False,TheRedPill,1527530978.0,True,"I've seen a lot of posts and questions regarding Social Media on here recently, so I thought I'd give a little insight into my Social Media cleanse and the corresponding results it's had on my life.

I had a fairly decent following (6k) but deleted my account for the following reasons:

I was pissing away time on it. Up to an hour a day, just looking at other peoples lives. Mostly women(I couldn't give a shit about updates on other mens' lives). I'd be scrolling through my feed, looking at women I found attractive, but wasn't fucking, basically orbiting. I never liked or commented on their posts, as they had enough of that going on with half of India's population commenting 'Nice bobs and Vagine"" or a horde of 12 yr old's commenting ""Suck my dick baby"". It became clear to me that this is generally the standard of man that lurks around, liking pictures, validating, showering them with attention when these women have nothing to offer besides their tits and ass. Yet they sit on their Social media throne getting ego muff dives. I was no longer going to be a part of this.

Unless you're a social media Chad, a wealthy man, showing a top 1% lifestyle, and a big following, you're basically the virtual equivalent of an orbiter. No woman ever logged on Instagram and saw Billy, with 12 posts and 152 followers, liking pic number 45 and a timid ""Hey"" in the DM's and thought wow, this guy seems like a real prospect. 

I have gotten some pussy off Instagram before, but weighing up the time investment, and my general disdain with Social Media in general i deleted it.

Fast Forward two weeks and I'm out at a Beach Bar celebrating a friends Birthday. It's Late, things are dying down and i spot an absolute beaut. Tall, Petite, Perky Ass, Fake tits(but well done). A real looker. My mate tells me she's a girl he's seen on Instagram, whips out his phone and shows me. She looks even better in the pictures. Has a 110k strong following. 

We were at a table with bottles, this generally seems to attract women like flies to shit, especially high status women. They want high status men, they're not as concerned about your looks as lower HB women. I'm the best looking of our group, so I stood out, and we're making eyes. I hop up and go over and introduce myself, I'm chatty and cheeky in general and make some light conversation. I start turning the conversation more sexual, trying to draw her in. She's fairly receptive to my advances. Music stops bar closes, i'm not quite at the point yet where I feel she'd come home, my phone was dead, so I told her to take my number, I don't think she's too used to this but seemed to like the cockiness that i would ask a ""girl of her calibre"" to do that. She took it and she went back to her friends, i went back to mine, we all went home. Later that night i recieve a smiley face, so i know she's fairly keen.

I didn't respond that night, i waited until after work the next day. To which she replies ""I thought you forgot about me"". We text a bit back and forth, she quickly asks what's my Instagram, I said i don't have it, she asks Facebook? nope not that either. I set up a date for later in the week, (told her I'm only available then). She agreed.

We meet up and the chat is flirty, she asks why I don't have Social Media, I told her my life is interesting enough i don't need updates on others. She attempts at some point during the night to show me her Social Media, i decline, i said, ""lets stick to the real world for tonight"". I think at this point she was realizing that she wasn't going to gain any favor from me through her Social Media following. 

The realm where she was queen and men bent at the knee for her didn't even feature in my life. She was no more to me than any other women i could be on a date with. She was going to have to gain my attention in other ways. Coupled with this she told me she couldn't do her usual social media vetting of me(because obviously i don't have it). This added to the Mystery i had going for me. She didn't know who I was, Who my friends were, What i did for a living, or how i spent my time. Even on the date i was very vague about everything, joking and deflecting when she asked questions. 

We were a bottle of wine down and the sexual tension was clear. She was wanting to order a cocktail, and i told her to skip it, We'll rather make them back at my place, I said ""I've got a better view anyway"" 

The rest is History.

Lessons:

 - Unless you're showing a great lifestyle, you're just another lurker, follower
 - You're wasting valuable time on Social Media that could be used far more constructively
 - With HB8-10 woman you can be as jacked, good looking as you want, they're looking for status
 - Mystery, maintain it at all costs, her hamster will fill in the blanks
 - Stand out, she had built up a huge following on Social Media, but with me this meant nothing, it immediately leveled the playing fields and she had to win over my favor in other ways
 - Take time texting her, don't be too available, a woman of this caliber is simply not used to it"

My Son Was Always a Poor Sleeper,121,3529,False,False,False,nosleep,1527469856.0,True,"My son was a poor sleeper. Several nights a week he’d stumble out of his bedroom, rubbing his eyes and struggling to fight off tears. I was always awake, usually watching late night TV while my wife dozed beside me. It’s not like I didn’t want to sleep. Of course I did. But I was a patrol cop and an insomniac.  Sleep barely came at the best of times. Those years weren’t anywhere close to the best of times.

“Are you okay, Daddy?”

“Yeah, bud. I’m okay.”

“I saw something scary.”

I’d go into his room and make a big show of checking his closet, under his bed, and his window. The window really scared him. “There’s a bad guy out there,” he always said.  “I’m gonna help you get him.”

Noah was big on getting bad guys. Not at all surprising; I’ve been a cop since before he was born. He told me all the time that he was going to grow up and get bad guys, too. 

I stopped checking his room around his fourth birthday. He would still toddle out, lip quivering, and asked the same question: “Are you okay, Daddy?”

“Yeah, bud. I’m okay.”

“I saw something scary.”

“It was just a nightmare, honey. Go ahead and go back to sleep.”

Noah blinked sleepily. One eye was always squinty; he could never quite open it til he’d been awake a good ten minutes. So he looked at me, one eye closed like a little pirate, then nodded and stumbled back to bed.

It was the same script, night after night. Maybe I handled it wrong. I always wondered if it’d be better for me to ignore him, or even get angry. But other than this late night ritual, he slept on his own just fine. Most of the time, he didn’t even remember waking up. 

These nights blended together into a warm, rosy continuum. It was selfish of me, but I looked forward to them. I worked third shift with a fair scattering of graveyard overtime. Due to sleep and work, I rarely saw Noah. That’s what made our nighttime ritual was so precious. It was the only time we really had by ourselves. 

My wife was always asleep whenever Noah came. Between her illness, caring for Noah, and general stress, she had no energy.  So most nights off, I’d sit awake into the wee hours, watching TV in a pointless bid to suppress the darkness that was eating me alive.

Noah pushed the darkness back. Not by much, but enough to keep me from sliding headlong into that pit.

It went like this for almost two years, night after night. The very last time he had a nightmare, the ritual finally changed.

Noah bumbled out, rubbing his eyes. They were teary and his face was puffy. “Daddy, are you really okay?”

“Yeah, bud. I’m okay.” The words – almost a chant by this point – visibly soothed him.

“I saw a bad guy in the window.”

“It was just a bad dream, honey.” 

Next to me, my wife shifted.

“I want to stop the bad guys.”

“You will when you’re grown up. Until then, I’m here.”

He released a last shuddering breath. “I love you.”

“I love you too. Go ahead and go back to sleep.”

I never saw him again.

Early the next morning, my wife took Noah for a drive. He loved being in the car. It was his favorite thing. The drive was almost over. They were three blocks from home. She waited until the light down at the intersection – a good two blocks away - turned red. Waiting for the flow of traffic to stop is the only safe way to do it. That’s what she did. That’s what she always did. 

But this one time at the exact wrong moment, someone sped through the red light at seventy miles an hour, hitting the passenger side and killing Noah. It pulverized him. We couldn’t even have an open casket funeral. 

My wife never recovered. I didn’t treat her well in the aftermath, either. She had a lot of chronic pain from her injuries, and on top of her health problems couldn’t function without medication. I didn’t quite dare to openly blame her for Noah’s death, but I ridiculed her for her painkillers. Called her dead weight. A drug addict.

We divorced and never spoke again. She died a few years ago from complications related to her illness. I miss her every day. I never told her, and now I never can.

I try to tell myself she wouldn’t care, but I know that’s a lie.

After the divorce, I rose through the ranks at my job pretty quickly for a while. But I stalled out at senior detective. The department assigned me to the sex crimes unit, and kept me there for ten years.

I’d thought patrol had eaten me alive, but this was a whole other monster. I made a lot of enemies, some in high places. Even uncovered a couple of my fellow officers, including my best friend. I became a functioning alcoholic and withdrew from everyone. Friendships and relationships weren’t worth it. How could they be, when there was no way to tell who was good and who was a monster?

In the end I wanted to die. Every night, before the drinking commenced, I unholstered my gun and set it on the coffee table. Then I prayed that I’d get drunk enough to finally kill myself.

Occasionally I got close. But whenever that happened, I’d wake up from the haze and for just an instant I’d be 31 again, with my wife dozing beside me and my son tromping down the hall to ask if I’m okay.

Those moments are what I live for now.

I was trying to get to that point a week ago. I sat in the living room like always, splitting my focus between the TV and my gun while steadily drinking myself into a stupor.

Somewhere in the house, a door creaked open. I didn’t pay attention. The house was old when we bought it. It’s incredibly drafty and I haven’t exactly been keeping up on repairs. It creaks and whistles all the time

But then something rustled in the hall. I turned as a small, familiar voice asked:

“Are you okay, Daddy?”

And there he was: Noah, four years old with a big head and red pajamas, squint-eyed and rubbing his face as his lip trembled.

For a delirious minute, I could almost believe that the past twenty years had been a bad dream. “Yeah, bud. I’m okay.”

“I saw something scary.”

“It was just a nightmare, honey. Go ahead and go back to sleep.”

He nodded and stumbled back to his room.

After a few minutes, I got up and checked the room. Empty. Cleared out, just as it had been for two decades.

I slid to the floor. Cracking joints, sore muscles, and alcohol nausea drove home the fact that I was very much fifty and very much alone. No bad dreams for me. Only a bad life.

I cried myself to sleep.

Noah came to me for several nights after that. Stumbling out of that empty bedroom, squinty and weepy. Same script. Same words. 

“Are you okay, Daddy?”

“Yeah, bud. I’m okay.”

“I saw something scary.”

“It was just a nightmare, honey. Go ahead and go back to sleep.”

I quickly learned not to check his room afterward.

It wasn’t much. I know that. But in all honesty it’s about as much as I had when he was alive. If I could have this ritual – just this ritual – for the rest of my life, I’d be happy.

But last night, he came out crying. “Daddy, are you really okay?”

“Yeah, bud. I’m okay.” 

“I saw a bad guy in the window.”

“It was just a bad dream, honey.” 

“Daddy, I want to stop the bad guys.”

My mouth went dry. Profound despair bloomed in my chest. So this was the end. Barely a week, and already done. “You will when you’re grown up. Until then, I’m here.”

“No! I want to stop them now!”

A series of muffled thumps suddenly came from Noah’s old room.

All the hair on my body stood on end. “Come here, Noah.”

Noah shook his head, inconsolable. “No.”

More thumps and a muffled curse.

My gun gleamed on the coffee table, ominous and inviting. I picked it up and crept into the hall. 

Heavy footsteps emanated from his room. The knob rattled and the door creaked open.

The muzzle of a shotgun came first, followed by the intruder. He froze when he saw me. His eyes glinted strangely, reminding me absurdly of lacquered porcelain. 

I shot him.

The back of his skull exploded, coating the door in blood and dull curls of brain matter.

I turned to Noah, ready to sweep him up and comfort him. But he didn’t need comforting. He was radiant. Tears were dry and he was smiling. He’d never smiled during our ritual before. 

That told me everything I needed to know. My heart broke again.

“I got the bad guy.” He stumbled sleepily down the hall to his room.

“You did,” I said.

He stopped at his bedroom door and released a contented sigh, oblivious to the corpse crumpled on the threshold. “I love you, Daddy.”

“I love you too.” My throat seemed to swell, choking off the words. Noah waited patiently. I struggled to get myself under control. We had a routine. A ritual. And I owed it to him to finish it. “Go ahead,” I whispered. “And go back to sleep.”

He went into his room.

After an agonizing second I ran after him. Of course it was as bare as ever. The emptiness destroyed me in a way nothing else ever has. I crawled to the corner where his bed used to be and wailed. 

I called 911 a few hours later. I apologized for the delay, said I had a panic attack and blacked out. No one cared. I’m on a routine internal affairs investigation, but that’s just for show.

My would-be killer was a guy I’d put in jail years ago. Child abuser, scum of the earth. I didn’t even remember him. I don’t want to.

I know I won’t see Noah again. My son slept poorly for twenty-four years because of me. He got the bad guy and saved his dad, so I'm sure he's resting now.

And wherever he is, I hope there aren’t any bad dreams.

Deliberately chose a sketchy truck rental place for a move - worked out fine.,9,220,False,False,False,TalesFromTheCustomer,1527519289.0,True,"Another move story on here reminded me of the last time I moved houses.

There was a delay with getting my first credit card (they shipped one with the wrong name on it so it took two additional weeks) which caused a delay in finding a vehicle to rent (need a credit card to book a vehicle).

Move day was Sept 1, so going with the biggest truck rental company in my city was not an option (the rep practically laughed at me on Aug 15th when I asked). So I went with somewhat more upscale company that had trucks available in my area.

I don't have a drivers license (It's not really necessary in my city for day-to-day shit), so I had a friend to actually do the driving part of the move, to be paid in pizza and beer.

Moving day comes and it's going to be somewhat complicated - We have to go from the rental place to my current apartment, to my girlfriends house (we were moving in together for the first time), to a furniture place owned by a friend-of-a-friend who had some free shit for us, finally to the new apartment.

I meet my friend at the rental office and oops! Turns out that my friend is actually too young for them to allow him to drive a truck. Fair enough, but now it looks like we're up shits creek (I had to be out of my apartment that day). Can't believe I didn't think of this.

Panicking, we go outside and start looking up other places in the area. We find a few places but I suggest we try a particular one that has something like 1.5 star on google reviews. My hope was that they'd be sketchy enough to not care that my friend was ~only~ 23.

Turns out I was correct! This place had a single box van that was in pretty rough shape. Seems that this particular company specialized in taking vehicles that were involved in accidents and fixing them up enough to be barely drivable. That meant that the vehicle had rented had some... quirks, such as not going above 50kph, constantly thinking the passenger-side door was open, and a couple spots in the box itself held together with duct tape.

Any port in a storm, I suppose. We take the truck out and are about an hour behind schedule at this point, however, other than that, the move goes without a hitch. We actually never manage to gain or lose any time after that so we were just an hour behind the whole day, which was not too big of a deal.

Left a stellar review for that company for sure.

Let me know everything you do!,18,629,False,False,False,MaliciousCompliance,1527517434.0,True,"I am an IT engineer.  I got assigned to a non\-technical, micro\-managing director.  She would be standing in my cube every morning at 7:59 AM and come by at 4:59 PM to be sure I was still working.  She felt I was fucking off since  being in IT, 98&amp;#37; of my maintenance had to be done after midnight, and I would sometimes not come in until 10 or 11 because I was working until 3 or 4 AM.  That was unacceptable and I was still expected to be warming my chair by 8 AM.  I was the only person doing my specialized job, at that time.

Being the obvious slacker she saw me for, she insisted on knowing EVERYTHING I did.  So I began drowning her in emails.  I would purposely make the emails as technical and convoluted as possible, assuming I was speaking to another engineer, instead of a paper pusher.  If she wanted to get anything out of the emails, she had to do hours of research, or ask me about them.  When she asked me about an email, I would take hours explaining it; painstakingly going over everything from the very basics to high level abstract.  I would say 80&amp;#37; of the time, after our discussions, she had no clue what we just talked about.I copied her on every email I sent, so she would be kept in the loop.

Sent her an email when nature called.  Sent her an email when I was back at my desk.  Sent her an email when I would grab a cup of coffee, which was often since I was averaging about 5 hrs sleep. Etc...  Over the course of a couple of months, I sent her \&gt; 2500 emails/month, each with a request receipt, so I would know she was getting them.  :\)

Eventually, she requested I move to another Director.  The next few years were a dream!  New Director was interested only in results, and managed that way.  Gave me a mission set me off to work.  Trusted me to do my job, did not need any communication if progress was being made, only at completion of my tasks or if I ran into an obstacle he could help remove.

  
TL;DR:  Drowned my Director in emails daily until I got a new Director."

For years, I hid, denied and tried to run from this part of my sexuality. Every time I indulged it, having sex with a man or even just masturbating to gay fantasies, afterward I felt as if I had done something horribly wrong — even as I argued to friends and family that gay people should be accepted and have equal rights. 

Then for some reason, it just clicked. I was masturbating and thinking about pleasing a man, feeling all the shame that that normally brought, when I had the thought, “This isn’t wrong. This is awesome.”

And I’m so happy to call myself bi. I love you boys and girls for your openness and self acceptance. "

I came out to my mom... again,25,151,False,False,False,askgaybros,1527523968.0,True,"I first came out to my mom three years ago and when I told her she said things like ""Don't worry it's a phase"", ""You're gay so, do you wanna be a woman?"", ""You think you're gay because everybody is coming out of the closet nowadays"", since then she hasn't been supportive at all and we barely talk about the fact I'm gay. She didn't change the way she treats me, however she has shown no interest in getting to know me, what I do and how's my life. It's like what I said was a joke and that's why she didn't listen. She just doens't take me seriously. (Actually, it seems everything I say is a joke and she doens't give me credit for what I do, I'm not going to describe every situation because it would be a long post)

Yesterday, I decided to come out to her again. We never had a great dialogue but I thought if she asks about my life I would answer them and we may build a strong mother son relationship (as we kind of had before I came out the first time). One of the questions was ""Are you still gay?"". To be honest, I was hurt because that question proved she's paid no attention to me, even though we live together and talk every day. It's clear she doesn't want a gay son. 

After I explained to her that I am gay, intead of giving support or trying to understand what I went through. All she said was ""OK. I want you to think about all the experiences you had in your life, you need to find out what made you gay or influenced you to think you're not straight so, we can work on that experience and turn you straight again. I'll help you"". She's in denial.

I just wanted to feel accepted but I don't know if it is possible to change her mind. I need some advice on how I can talk to her about it because I'm not coming out again.  "

""Study on chemical refereed to as FOOF, yes."" Why the human felt the need to repeat stuff like that was something he never quite understood. No one else from the human research group did it.

""There are some strange results here. What model did you use as the basis for the simulation?""

""Simulation? Im confused sir, we were ordered to find the properties of this chemical.""

""Through simulation yes, it's highly unstable. Wait, you didn't use a simulation?"" Some of the things written in the report started to get back to him. What was that about a blowtorch now again?

""No sir, just standard experiments."" He started to fervently flip through the report.


&amp;nbsp;


""Wait, wait, wait. So here under preparations, you actually did THIS?""

""Yes, we loaded the ballast tank with a mixture of oxygen and fluorine gas then ran it through a 700-degree-heating block."" Fluorine gas, the most reactive of all elements and extremely poisonous as well as corrosive, oxidising and burns in contact with organic elements. And the humans had heated it to 700 FUCKING DEGREES!!! The human apparently took his stunned silence as an instruction to continue.

""Don't worry, the resulting chemical FOOF is stored perfectly safe at -180°C in our lab."" Where precisely was the humans lab located now again? It wasn't close by was it? He took a deep breath to try to steady himself.


&amp;nbsp;


""A-Alright, carrying on."" For his internal vision the different experiments mentioned took on a whole different light. ""Ehm, you mentioning reacting it with, ehm."" He looked at the list of elements the humans had tried; ethyl alcohol (blue flame and explosion), liquid methane (white flame, at -180°C), ammonia ('vigorus', at -170°C), chlorine (explosion, so they added it more slowly *the second time*!). Unable to get another word out and feeling dangerously close to fainting, he apparently must have looked terrible cause the human feelt a need to continue.

""Ah yes, sorry about the sulfur compounds. The thermodynamics turned out to be a bit to extreme for us. But I believe if we can get some better equipment, we might be able to give it a shot!"" The human seemed, happy? Exalted even, at the mentioning of this proposed suicide. As per it own calculations it would release 6 kcal/g. TNT is 1 kcal/g, and it doesn't FREAKING cause everything else to spontaneously combust! EVERYTHING! As in such combustible material as: sand, concrete, asbestos and fiberglass!

""Ehm, ehm, uh."" His mouth wasn't working properly. Pretty sure his brain wasn't either. Thoughts such as ""NO YOU FREAKING DON'T"" and ""WHY EVEN? I. DON'T. HOW?"" was racing through it, but didn't seem to be able to find an exit.

""Well, uhm. I can see that you are a bit disappointed in us. I will check if we can't do the experiment with the things we have anyway. I'll be back in a moment!"" At that the human turned and walked away. Which was just as well cause all his muscles had given out, causing him to slip out from his chair and onto the ground. His last words before he fainted was ""Please, don't.""

Now you might think that this story was exaggerated, blown up so to speak. No human would ever actually do stuff like this? I present to you the legend, the madman: A. G. Streng and his paper [""The Chemical Properties of Dioxygen Difluoride""](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jklein2/O2F2.pdf). For those of you less skilled in the arcane arts of stuff that detonates things at 90K (that's -180°C or -300°F). Here's a glorious, more approachable, blog article aptly named [""Things I Wont Work With: Dioxygen Difluoride""](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/02/23/things_i_wont_work_with_dioxygen_difluoride).

He had a block in which he commentated Smash 4, DBFZ and Tekken 7 all in the span of about 18 hours, and not just round 1 pools matches either. It reminds me of how a top player learns to master multiple characters, its cool seeing one of your favorite commentators popping up on several streams doing all your favorite games

Hes been at it for awhile now (he did some assorted commentary at GTX 2017), but his game IQ is quickly improving this year, he had his specific notations down and it was clear he has been doing his homework. One thing Ive noticed hes really good at is **turning moments where you are less knowledgeable into learning opportunities for the audience**. It can be a very awkward thing to do, but the phrasing of questions and timing for pivoting to a more experienced co-commentator can make it seem way more natural

He also had great synergy with his various mic workers, he and [Tasty Steve](https://twitter.com/TKbreezy/status/1000888019166081024) felt like they had been working together for years. Someone made a joke about how between those two, they could probably commentate over half the EVO lineup for any given year

A LOT of twitch chat was noticing and asking ""who is this guy?/where can I hear him at more events?"" and it was fun to show folks all the Black Plague highlights and other Smash related stuff. If youre a fan, be sure to catch him and others at the [Smash Switch invitational](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/8lscre/super_smash_bros_invitational_2018_commentators/) in a few weeks!

"CMV: The term ""Islamaphobia"" is little more than a means to shelter a (western) minority's religious doctrine from the scrutiny it warrants.",411,536,False,False,False,changemyview,1527506504.0,True,"""Islamophobia"" Implies that the notion of criticising Islam is irrational; that a critical stance taken against Islam is indicative of a mental disorder. I, and I'm sure many others, would not find the  term so vexatious were it confined to the fringes, however it is now prevalent in the mainstream as well. The term is used by non-muslim academics, political figures, and journalist alike. By referring to someone as Islamophobic you are asserting that a dogmatic thousand year old belief system is beyond contemporary criticism. 

I am not against Muslims as individuals, but what many believe I feel should very much be exposed to the brunt of rational scrutiny. The Quran and hadith contain a plethora of verses and stories that unsurprisingly act to primarily and partially inspire violence and/or execration. Here are some pieces from the scripture that I find morally objectionable:

&gt;""Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikun will abide in the Fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures""- Quran 98:6

&gt;“Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.” – Ephesians 5:22

&gt;“I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them” - Quran 8:12

&gt;The Quran cites the story of the ""people of Lot"" destroyed by the wrath of God because they engaged in lustful carnal acts between men.

&gt;""Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.""

A further issue here is that many of these verses abrogate a lot of the peaceful verses that come before them.

If publicly criticising Islam is considered ""hate speech"", then would the Quran and Hadith not also fall into this category?

These techniques can also help you with branding if you don't have budget for an agency",32,293,False,False,False,Entrepreneur,1527508822.0,True,"I initially wrote this as a comment over on the Indiehackers community, and then it evolved into a [blog post](https://chrisdermody.com/how-to-pick-a-name-for-your-side-project-or-business-in-10-minutes-and-is-available-as-com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=entrepreneur&amp;utm_campaign=domaintips), but I think it's really useful for quickly picking a name and not becoming paralysed/disheartened by your favourites not being available as a .com.

&amp;nbsp;

* Only use .com and .io (or .app now, maybe), it simplifies things and they're cheap. Open domainr for quick and easy availability lookup. Domainr is cool because it'll also show you other domains that might suit your keyword too, like if your keyword is mydevportfolio, it'll suggest [mydevportfol.io](https://mydevportfol.io) (full disclosure, that's my side project, feedback appreciated) 👍


* SEO is key, so my go-to to start off the process is often things like my[keyword].com, [keyword]hq.com, [keyword]central.com etc. If you're lucky, one of these will be available, but it's getting rarer nowadays. So we need to go deeper.

* Next, I'll look at synonyms. Open up thesaurus.com, type in your main keyword and see what comes back. This can be fed into the rest of the steps to find suitable variations.

* My next port of call is usually looking at [verb/adjective][keyword].domain. Some of my go-to adjectives are: fresh, sharp, open, free, hot. Some of my goto nouns are: spark, air, bounce, break, snap. Feel free to pop these into thesaurus too to find more.

* My next goto if I don't find a suitable one in the steps above us to get a bit creative with language. I'll open up Google translate and translate from English to Latin. Often Latin spits back decent words that don't make sense, but sound cool and can give a nice story to your brand. Put in your keyword and synonyms and see what comes back. This doesn't work all the time, but can spit out gems sometimes.

* If I still haven't found a name I'm happy with, I'll look to the animal kingdom. What emotion do you want a customer to associate with your brand? If its strength, why not use something like lion, bull, rhino, bear. If it's friendliness, try koala, kitten, puppy, panda. Figure out the emotion and then Google to find animals that best fit that. Once you have some to try, combine them with your keyword and/or a verb or noun. So [noun/adjective] [animal].domain. Freshpuppy.io, sparkbear.com. Or if it makes sense, mix up the animal with the keyword. Koalabooks.com, gorrilladesign.io etc. One of the advantages of this approach is it gives you ideas for logos that suit too.

* Colours. I have a blog post on [how to ""cheat"" when picking a colour for your app](https://chrisdermody.com/colour_scheme_minimum_viable_product/), basically how to automatically inspire a certain emotion or action in a user. Use this to identify what colours might suit your business, and try inserting them instead of nouns/adejectives. Once you identify the base colour, Google different shades of that colour to get some ideas. Violetbooks.com. Limedesign.io.

* Rhyming. This can be handy to come up with double-barrel business names that rhyme. Pop open rhymer.com and type in your keyword. You'd be surprised what results you get back that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise!



&amp;nbsp;

And that's it. What do you think? Let me know if you have a better process, but that's mine for the moment. 

I write about this type of thing a lot, and I'm currently trying to build profitable side-businesses as an indie developer. You can follow along over [here](https://chrisdermody.com/subscribing/). 

Thanks!

I always see her posts on facebook, and she never failed to amaze me how much she wanted everyone to change for good; how much she wanted everyone to stop overlooking important issues such as politics and education. Even if on some things we didn't share the same opinion, I still respected her.

She didn't deserve to die. She was still young, too many dreams in life she wanted to accomplish. She was her parents' first born, but now, her younger brother has to take her place and take good care of their family. 

Time flies really fast. Few days ago, she was still alive. And she had no clue her time was running out. But that is the reality we need to face -- that we are all bound to die.

"Dear Husband,",85,1524,False,False,False,UnsentLetters,1527477097.0,True," We dated blissfully four years before tying the knot. I'm thinking back to when you said you wanted to grow old with me. Did you know I trusted you when my dad gave me away on our wedding day?

Remember that time you broke the only gift my great grandmother ever gave me \(her crystal sugar bowl\), just to see the crushed look on my face? Did you drink\-in my sorrow?  


Do you recall the time when you made fun of my profession and told me I would never be successful? Were you energized by my surprise?

How about all those trips you drove recklessly just to see the expression of fear on my face? Did you enjoy my terror?

What about the night you sat me down to calmly confess how ugly and disgusting I looked to you? Did you savor my utter humiliation and soak up how helpless I felt?  


How about after I quit my job to stay home and your verbal and emotional abuse turned violent. Did you feel like a true man when you would not let me out of that room? What about those bruises?

I let you break many things, but you did not break me. Did you think I would forget?  


Remember the weekly allowance you so graciously give? You smirk as you hand it over, but don't notice my expression.

What about that job I just got for the first time in many years\- the one you think is so cute? I am adding a portion of my earnings to my allowance savings each week. Can you feel my contempt?

Do you know that technology course I took? I know all our account passwords now. Did you think you could hide it from me? I track it all on a spreadsheet.

How about that Wednesday therapist appointment to make me a better wife for you? I bet you'd never guess she guides victims of domestic violence to new lives.

When I clean each week, do you know I am really packing? Therapy sure is whipping this wife into shape.  


Remember till death do us part?  You will be growing old without me.

\-The wife you lost"

"My public high school told us we couldn’t make good decisions without Jesus, at our graduation ceremony, and then gave us all bibles.",85,374,False,False,False,atheism,1527523021.0,True,"I go to a very small school in Missouri, probably less than 100 kids in the entire k-12th grade and every year for graduation they have the preacher come and give a speech knowing that several people in this town, including myself, are not Christian. The graduation speech always turns into a sermon. Every. Single. Year. So I get that it’s tradition, but damn. 

I still remember how in middle school, in our science class, the teacher made it a point to “tell us what we needed to know about evolution and the creation of the universe to pass the end of the year test” but she then said something along the lines of how we all knew what REALLY happened from reading the Bible, she just had to teach the other because of state tests, and we kind of left it at that. Idk, maybe I’m just being stupid and letting things get to me but this school is awful. Half the girls here are pregnant and almost all the guys are racist. Some of the things I’ve seen AT SCHOOL are ridiculous. It’s sad to me that places like this are still allowed to be open. Sorry if this was long and stupid, I just needed to rant.

I’ll end with the three points of advice given to our graduating seniors (I’m copying it word for word from our school newsletter that is sent out to the entire town.)

1. Jesus helps you make responsible decisions; you can’t make responsible decisions on your own.
2. Seek God to know God, and you will be blessed. 
3. Pick your battles. Have pure motives. Use what you know. Give God the glory.

My dogs are big and as I said one wasn't planned for. She showed up and I spent a lot of money helping her. So yes you can chide me but whatever life is complicated. 

Anyhow. If anyone knows where I can find internal tick treatments for less I'd be so appreciative. No need for judgement I just need a solution.

##Week of May 20 - 26: What we Learned in the Russia Probe

[Taxi King](https://imgur.com/lAlbmHO)

--------------------------------------------------------

###Mueller investigation

Mueller is investigating Psy-group, an Israeli firm that specializes in collecting information and shaping opinion through social media.

* Mueller’s team has [obtained](http://archive.is/Ok2L3#selection-2535.141-2535.179) a nine-slide presentation prepared by Psy-group that outlines ways in which Trump’s 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts. 
    * “The presentation outlines the ways in which social media “bots” and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of Mr. Trump... [one] slide says the firm identified 140 pro-Trump websites linked to a man in Macedonia… Another slide outlines a Facebook strategy where fake online profiles or “avatars” engage real people online and encourage them to share content,” resulting in a “multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies.” It is unclear who received the presentation.
* Psy-group is owned by Joel Zamel, who has [been questioned](http://archive.is/HFfDt#selection-2315.103-2315.177) by Mueller’s team. After the 2016 election, Psy-group “ formed a strategic partnership” with Cambridge Analytica in a joint bid to win business from the U.S. government and other clients.
* Zamel first appeared in the news when the [NYT identified him](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/us/politics/trump-jr-saudi-uae-nader-prince-zamel.html) as a participant in a second Trump Tower meeting. Don Jr., Zamel, George Nader, and Erik Prince met three months before the 2016 election to strategize ways to help Trump Sr. win. Nader, acting as an emissary of Saudi Arabia and UAE, expressed the Crown Princes’ desire to assist Trump in his win. Zamel “extolled his company’s ability to give an edge to a political campaign; by that time, the firm had already drawn up a multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr. Trump.” Don Jr. reportedly responded “approvingly.”

Giuliani [made up](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/trump-says-he-will-ask-justice-department-to-look-into-campaign-surveillance-idUSKCN1IL0PQ) a supposed September 1st deadline for the Mueller probe, according to a source familiar with Mueller’s investigation.

* A source familiar with the probe called the Sept. 1 deadline “entirely made-up” and “another apparent effort to pressure the special counsel to hasten the end of his work...He’ll wrap it up when he thinks he’s turned over every rock…”

In an [interview with HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-giuliani-collusion_us_5b0487f8e4b05f0fc8429767), Giuliani argued that if Trump colluded with Russia or any foreign entity, it wouldn’t be a crime. His exact words: “OK, and if it is [collusion], it isn’t illegal... It was sort of like a gift,” he said. “And you’re not involved in the illegality of getting it.”

The [AP reviewed](https://www.apnews.com/a3521859cf8d4c199cb9a8567abd2b71/The-princes,-the-president-and-the-fortune-seekers?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP_Politics) leaked emails between Elliott Broidy, former RNC Finance Chairman and top fundraiser for Trump, and George Nader, who is now cooperating with Mueller. The two men pitched themselves to the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE as a backchannel to the White House in a scheme to enrich themselves.

* Saudi Arabia and the UAE were “seeking to alter U.S. foreign policy and punish” their archrival Qatar. After a year of lobbying Washington and making large donations to various politicians, Nader and Broidy expected to receive massive consulting contracts from the two Gulf nations. 
* “Summaries written by Broidy of two meetings he had with Trump — one of which has not been disclosed before — report that he was passing messages to the president from the two princes and that he told Trump he was seeking business with them.”
* It appears from the AP’s reporting that the two men would have gotten their big payout had Mueller not intervened and detained Nader at the airport in mid-January 2018.

Elliott Broidy is [now suing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/broidy-s-expanded-hack-allegations-fault-ex-spy-emir-s-brother) various people/entities, including a Qatari official, that he claims hacked his emails and leaked them to the media. 

* Interestingly, this Qatari official, Ahmed al-Rumaihi, is [the same man](https://www.thedailybeast.com/elliott-broidy-sues-michael-cohen-linked-qatari-operative-over-hacked-emails) caught on video meeting with Michael Cohen in Trump Tower AND the same man who claims Michael Cohen asked him for $1 million in exchange for helping a Qatari investment fund with American projects. 
* Broidy further asserts that the actual hacks were coordinated by a U.S. company linked to a former CIA spy. His lawsuit lays out that “a U.S.-based security firm, Global Risk Advisors, introduced Qatar to “cyber mercenaries” who executed that hack. Those alleged hackers include Omniscope Ltd., a U.K.-based security and intelligence firm.”

Spanish police [have given](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-son-concerned-wiretaps-show-trump-jr-met-putin-ally-231215529.html) the FBI wiretaps of conversations involving Putin ally Alexander Torshin, who met with Don Jr. during an NRA convention in May 2016. The lead Spanish investigator has said: “Mr. Trump’s son should be concerned.” Torshin had multiple contacts with conservative activists in the United States during the election, seeking to set up a summit between the Russian president and then candidate Trump. 

The Putin ally and Russian hedge fund manager who met with Erik Prince in the Seychelles, Kirill Dmitriev, has [contradicted](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putin-ally-seychelles-meeting-erik-prince-chance-encounter/story?id=55408942) Prince’s account of the meeting as a chance encounter “over a beer” - suggesting he had wanted to meet with Prince in order to improve relations between the U.S and Russia. Dmitriev would not state that the meeting wasn’t planned in advance.

Roger Stone’s emails [reveal](http://archive.is/WKYAZ) he privately sought information he considered damaging to Clinton from Wikileaks’ Julian Assange during the 2016 campaign, raising questions about Stone’s testimony to Congress.

* In Sepember 2016, Stone sent an email to Randy Credico, an acquantance of both Stone and Assange, stating: “Please ask Assange for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30--particularly on August 20, 2011.”
* Rep. Adam Schiff says the emails were not provided to congressional investigators. “If there is such a document, then it would mean that his testimony was either deliberately incomplete or deliberately false,” said Schiff.
* Also in the emails are threats from Stone as Credico became more vocal about discrepancies in Stone’s account of their interactions. In early April, in one of those emails, Stone accused Credico of serving as an informant. “Everyone says u are wearing a wire for Mueller,” the April 7 email said. Two days later, Stone wrote: “Run your mouth = get sued.” Credico denies being an informant, and has sent [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/roger-stone-to-associate-prepare-to-die/) screenshots of threats from Stone, including a message saying “prepare to die.”
* Stone appeared on Meet the Press, saying that he is “prepared” for the possibility that he will be indicted for “some extraneous crime pertaining to my business” that Mueller’s team “may seek to conjure up.”
* Credico has reportedly told Democratic Committee staffers that Assange is willing to meet with Rep. Schiff. Schiff’s response? “Our committee would be willing to interview Julian Assange when he is in U.S. custody, not before.”

The FBI has [seized control](https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-fbi-seizes-control-of-russian-botnet?ref=scroll) of a key server in the Kremlin’s global botnet of 500,000 hacked routers, linked to Fancy Bear - the Russian hacking group that hit the DNC in 2016. 

* The malware has turned up in 54 countries, including the US. The best way to ensure you are not affected is to reboot your router. 

Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/999252093998370817) that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated “Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign.” This was an intentional misquote of what Clapper actually said on The View. The full exchange is [transcribed by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/politics/fact-check-trump-clapper-campaign-spy.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpolitics), but can be paraphrased as: Clapper stated the FBI was not spying on the Trump campaign, they were spying on what the Russians “were doing.” He explicitly states he dislikes the term ‘spying’. A better description would seem to be ‘intelligence gathering’. 

* Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani went on TV Sunday and [admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/27/rudy-giuliani-spygate-robert-mueller-donald-trump) that Trump’s “Spygate” claims are actually an attempt to sway public opinion against Mueller’s investigation. Further, Giuliani stated that the decision to impeach Trump is going to come up, and he hopes that Trump’s attacks on Mueller will limit the risk of impeachment.

**Michael Cohen**

Cohen’s long-time business partner, Evgeny Freidman, has [reached a deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-taxi-cooperation.html) to cooperate with federal and state prosecutors. 

* Freidman is called the [“Taxi King”](http://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-taxi-king-rise-fall-2017-8#arrest-on-tax-fraud-charges-9) because, at his peak in 2015, he owned 1,100 taxi medallions, which put his net worth in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion. However, as Business Insider explains, the rise of ride-sharing companies like Uber tanked the value of taxi medallions. Freidman defaulted on a $34 million loan and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for 22 of his companies. In June 2017 he was arrested and charged with four counts of tax fraud and one count of grand larceny. 
* Cohen’s connection to Freidman: Freidman managed cabs for Cohen (for the past 16 years, according to Freidman), even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage medallions. As of August of 2017, Cohen [reportedly](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/michael-cohen-unpaid-taxes-taxi-business) owed more than $40,000 in back taxes related to the medallions.
* As confirmation of Freidman’s cooperation became public, Cohen [insisted](http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-cohen-responds-to-report-that-the-taxi-king-may-flip-on-him-2018-5) they were not business partners. He [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/999273095159525378): “I am one of thousands of medallion owners who entrust management companies to operate my medallions according to the rules of the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. Gene Freidman and I are not partners and have never been partners in this business or any other. #MediaWrongAgain”
* However, [public records reveal](https://forward.com/news/national/401764/exclusive-michael-cohens-trump-org-emails-tied-to-crooked-taxi-king/) that “Cohen used his Trump email on multiple occasions to conduct business for his NY Funky Taxi Corp. medallion, which Freidman managed since at least 2012.” This makes it much harder for Cohen to argue that he was practicing law, as he was using a business email. 

Last year, Cohen [received a secret payment](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44215656) of at least $400k from Ukraine to arrange a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko.

* Poroshenko reportedly desired a meeting with Trump because he had backed Clinton during the election, likely authorizing a leak from Ukraine’s anti-corruption agency showing Manafort received millions of dollars from pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. However, Ukraine's registered lobbyists and embassy in Washington DC was unable to secure more than a brief photo-op with Trump. Cohen was contacted as a back channel to Trump.
* The meeting, which Poroshenko called a ""substantial visit,"" occurred in June 2017. Shortly after Poroshenko returned Ukraine, the country’s anti-corruption agency stopped its investigation into Manafort. 
* According to the BBC: “One source in Kiev said Mr Poroshenko had given Trump ‘a gift’ - making sure that Ukraine would find no more evidence to give the US inquiry into whether the Trump campaign ‘colluded’ with Russia.”

Video footage in Trump Tower [reveals](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/us/politics/michael-cohen-viktor-vekselberg-trump-tower.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss) that Cohen met with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg 11 days before the presidential inauguration to allegedly discuss improving U.S. - Russia relations under Trump. Also present was Andrew Intrater, owner of the private equity firm Columbus Nova that awarded Mr. Cohen a $1 million consulting contract. Vekelsberg was stopped by Mueller’s team and questioned earlier this year. Intrater has been interviewed by Mueller’s team twice, focusing partly on his dealings with Cohen.

* [Michael Avenatti](http://www.newsweek.com/michael-avenatti-russia-trump-cohen-columbus-nova-945819): “There’s a reason why Columbus Nova’s story keeps changing by the day and there’s a reason why they are covering-up. The truth is not pretty...but it is necessary. Mr. Trump will not serve out his term.” 

On April 5th, Cohen [attended a meeting](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/michael-cohen-met-with-qatari-official-and-nuclear-plant-owner-last-month/) with Franklin Haney, the owner of an Alabama nuclear power plant, and Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, Qatar’s minister of economy and commerce and deputy chairman of the Qatar Investment Authority. 

* A source familiar with the discussion states Cohen and Thani “met with Haney to discuss possible Qatari investment in his nuclear power plant.” Sources also told Mother Jones that Cohen could have expected to receive a finder’s fee if a deal were struck.
* This isn’t the only time Cohen met with Al Thani - that same week in April, Cohen [met with him](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/18/trump-lawyer-met-with-qatari-government-official-days-before-fbi-raid/) in Florida on the sidelines of the Qatar-US Economic Forum. In December 2016, Cohen [met with a different](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/ahmed-al-rumaihi-michael-cohen-asked-me-for-usd1-million-to-work-with-trump-white-house.html) Qatari official to pitch him access to the Trump White House in exchange for $1 million.
* Haney “has [aggressively courted](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/michael-cohen-met-with-qatari-official-and-nuclear-plant-owner-last-month/) the Trump administration,” giving $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee and at least $125,000 to the Republican National Committee this year. Haney is also a member of Mar-a-Lago and has “bragged to associates that he has dined with Trump at least a dozen times since the election.”

###Congress
The DOJ held [two highly classified briefings](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/democrat-schiff-added-justice-department-briefing-russia-probe-sources-n877111) for congressional leaders on Thursday, May 24th, about the investigation into Trump’s campaign and the FBI’s use of an informant. 

* The first meeting was originally intended to be only for Republican leaders, namely Nunes and Gowdy. However, after outrage and pushing by the public and the Democrats, one of their leaders was allowed to attend. Thus the first meeting included Rep. Trey Gowdy, Speaker Paul Ryan, Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Devin Nunes, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Rod Rosenstein, and Chris Wray. The second meeting was attended by the “Gang of Eight,” the leaders of both parties from both chambers, and the heads of the intelligence committees. 
* Causing great controversy, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House lawyer Emmet Flood [showed up](https://www.thedailybeast.com/white-house-lawyer-crashes-fbi-meeting-on-trump-russia-investigation) unexpectedly at both briefings. At least two participants in the briefings told Kelly and Flood their appearance was inappropriate. The two men left both meetings after making introductory remarks, “to relay the President’s desire for as much openness as possible under the law.” 
* Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was much more frank about the purpose of Kelly and Flood’s appearances, stating: “We want to see how the briefing went to today and how much we learned from it,” referring to how he’s deciding whether or not Trump will sit for an interview with Mueller. “If we learned a good deal from it, it will shorten that whole process considerably.”
* Upon leaving the briefing, Schiff read [a statement](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/democrat-schiff-added-justice-department-briefing-russia-probe-sources-n877111) of behalf of himself, Pelosi, and Schumer: ""Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intel agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign.”
* Mitch McConnell echoed this sentiment, [telling Fox News](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/mcconnell-says-he-learned-nothing-particularly-surprising-at-doj-briefing) he had learned “nothing particularly surprising.” 

###Other

[Jared Kushner](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html) &amp; [Ivanka Trump](https://www.axios.com/ivanka-trump-security-clearance-status-jared-kushner-f0ff4333-3665-4778-9c35-ba10bae55d94.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_content=1100) have both received full security clearances. The same NYT article also revealed Jared Kushner has sat for two interviews with Mueller’s team, lasting many hours. The [most recent](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/kushners-permanent-security-clearance-doesnt-mean-hes-in-the-clear.html) occurred in April, according to Kushner’s lawyer.

It seems Trump’s trade war has turned out to be beneficial afterall - for the Trump’s! In addition to Trump Sr. receiving a $500 million investment from China in an Indonesian development deal, Ivanka Trump [now has five *more* trademarks](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-gets-5-china-trademarks-as-president-works-zte-deal_us_5b0a07eee4b0568a880c0a0d?ncid=engmodushpmg00000006) approved in China.

Some are [suggesting](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/more-evidence-that-broidy-was-covering-for-trump-in-affair.html) that it’s very likely Elliot Broidy is covering for Trump’s affair with a Playboy Playmate (and her subsequent abortion).

**To note…**

Resistance news: I’m including this because one of the most frustrating experiences is watching people - rational people - fall for dishonest (or at least non-transparent) people on twitter. First, it was [Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/trump-tweets-hoax-louise-mensch-claude-taylor). Then [Scott Dworkin](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cash-for-coalition-against-trump-going-into-consultants-pockets-instead). Now [Ed and Brian Krassenstein](https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-seized-a-fortune-from-resistance-icons-accused-of-boosting-online-ponzi-schemes) - who the Feds say illegally hawked investment scams. “Law enforcement officials last year seized nearly half a million dollars from the brothers, money that prosecutors say was derived from wire fraud.” *Please apply the same rational, logical, and healthy skepticism of people who claim to be on the left as to those who are on the right.*

It is with a heavy heart we announce that morethan.tv will be shutting down over the next few weeks. The reason for shutting down is that staffers have busy life and doesn't have time or power to build this place to what you deserve it to be.

We want to thank our dedicated FLS and staffers, former and present for all their hard work on building MTV to what it is today. And to our users, thanks a thousand for all your support. This would not have been possible without you.

Our servers will stay online for as long as they are paid for and we estimate that will be at least three more weeks. Take this time to download what you want to see in the future, and if you are feeling like it, upload stuff to another tracker that is missing what we have.

And now as a warning, I know that most of you won't have a choice but we SERIOUSLY warn against joining nebulance. a couple of months ago we where in discussions with alastor about a possible merger between MTV and NEB, and during a light security audit of their tracker we found several critical security breaches, e.g. their SQL server beeing open to the internet and servers registered in alastor's own name. They lack a security focused culture within their ranks, and joining them will put you in a elevated risk in terms of law enforcement or malicious people.

Again, thanks for a wonderful time. And we hope to see you guys around.
-Regards staff

PSA: The Reddit redesigned UI is worse for privacy compared to the old UI.,196,1335,False,False,False,privacy,1527476718.0,True,"Reddit has been trying to redesign their website to feel more ""modern"", but I have noticed that the redesigned UI also features more tracking.

For one, the new UI (and the new userpage) features session replay tracking *everywhere* (recording of your mouse movements, keystrokes, and how you interact with the website), as evident by its use of the `mousemove` JavaScript event listener for the entire page. I found out using [Luminous](https://gbaptista.github.io/luminous/doc/en-US/) *(this isn't an endorsement or ad)*, which is an extension that detects (and can block) JavaScript events. The old UI also listens for the `mousemove` event but not everywhere (I have only noticed it on the ""submit post"" page, but there are probably a few other places), though I'm not sure if this is due to session replay tracking. I cannot say for certain that the old UI doesn't have session replay or something similar, but to me it doesn't seem like it for most pages. Perhaps someone who has investigated this further can confirm or deny.

Session replay is another form of tracking what you click on (possibly negating attempts to opt out of ""regular"" tracking of outbound links), can be used to fingerprint a user (how the mouse moves), and will negate attempts to delete posts and comments (for example, ones that accidentally contain personal information or passwords). Even accidentally pasting something like a password in a text box will result in the password being sent to Reddit (and/or a third party) and being stored in plain text. I don't know how Reddit manages user data internally, but with session recording it's possible that a Reddit employee playing back a session to assess user reaction to a new UI update may end up seeing your private messages or posts in private subreddits simply because it was there when you interacted with the page.

Also, the Reddit redesign *completely* breaks without JavaScript enabled, to the point where you can't click on links or even see the page content. 

The old UI is still available to users, either through a setting in your account or (if you're not logged in) through `old.reddit.com`. You can also replace the 'www' part of the URL with 'old' on any Reddit page to get back to the old UI. I really, *really* hope they don't remove this."

How does a young person with little financial knowledge get started?,113,203,False,False,False,investing,1527513491.0,True,"I am in my 20s and already have some savings. I would like to put these to work. I'm European if this matters.

I have 0 financial background. I have some but very little knowledge about the markets and investing. I know the basic differences between stock, fund, ETF, index or indicator. I somewhat know what technical analysis is and what it's for. I occasionally read investopedia when I don't know the meaning of some term.

I know that investing is stock is much riskier than investing in funds, and I have been ""taught"" that you shouldn't invest in stock unless you really know what you're doing. I guess this is good advice I should take, as a beginner.

I hear about Vanguard all the time. I'm not sure what it *is* (as in, Deutsche Bank is a **bank**, while Vanguard is a...? broker I think is the term?) In any case, as I understand it, it's some kind of financial entity that lets you invest in a diverse selection of funds. Banks also let you do this, so what's the difference? A person has shared with me their reservations about putting their money in these external *entities* instead of having your regular bank hold it. Have these reservations any good foundation? How safe/unsafe is Vanguard compared to banks? (a difference I can think of is that banks can be rescued by the goverment, at least this happened in my country, but brokers would just default?)

I am most interested in technical analysis, not that I am familiar with other strategies other than retirement plans or low risk funds you don't need to babysit, and have tweaked with [stockcharts](http://stockcharts.com/) quite some time. I just found out about [Above the Green Line](http://stockcharts.com/public/1107832/tenpp/1) and it sounds pretty interesting. Is this a legit strategy or is it a pass? I do know about backtesting although I have no idea how to do it, but I guess this strategy could be tested this way? Or I could create a portfolio in Morningstar and simulate investments to test it? Is this a good idea to see if it works? I've read however, some people saying this strategy misuses technical analysis. But then why is it ranked up so high?

In any case: how do I get started in this whole world? As I've said, I'm interested in technical analysis and I don't mind spending time to learn all this and to then put to use this knowledge and watch the market daily, etc (as opposed to people who would rather put it all in a fund and forget about out because they don't have time for it or simply don't want to spend it), but I don't want to be doing this 24/7 either as I have obligations as you can imagine.

PS: I *have* checked out the sidebar FAQ."
Weird iPhone recorded conversation over Bluetooth,63,375,False,False,False,iphone,1527501450.0,True,"Tldr, new iPhone started playing the audio of a conversation over car Bluetooth that was had on it the day before from no discoverable source within the phone, only stopped with initiation of a call. Where was it playing from and how/why was it recorded?

Story: finally convinced GF to get her first iPhone (8 Plus) a couple days ago. Yay blue text. Last night I'm driving her car, we're listening to music on my iPhone X via USB connection, hers is connected via Bluetooth to the dash. 

She had just finished watching a video of her nephew on her phone when all of a sudden my USB music gets muted and the car Bluetooth acts as if it's in an active phone call playing audio over the speakers of a phone conversation she had the day before with her girlfriend. I'm hearing both ends of their conversation. Somehow their conversation was recorded and is now being played back.

I take her phone and look in her phone app, there's no active call, no voicemail being played back, the control center doesn't show an active pause-able media being played. On her Bluetooth display it's showing as if it's an active ongoing call. We try clicking ""end call"" on the car screen but nothing. I finally terminated it by going into her phone and initiating a call to me. 

So where was this coming from? And why the hell was her entire phone call somehow recorded? We're both really confused and she's freaked out about ""iPhones and privacy"" now. 

Edit to add details, it was on T-Mobile in a Toyota Scion. As someone else suggested, I almost wonder if it was the car and not the iPhone since the phone had no indication it was putting out any audio or engaged in a call, but I'm still baffled. She's had the car about 6 months and nothing like this ever happened on her POS Android. 

Edit 2: she went through her voicemails and found that the call was recorded/saved in her voicemail. Sounds like carrier T-Mobile thing? And she is the one who made the call, so not like she answered a call as it was getting sent to VM. And doesn't explain how when I went into her phone app it wasn't showing it was playing a voicemail and she denies having been in her voicemail prior to the event but.. 🤷🏼‍♂️"

RETRIAL for u/Usernamecheckouts13 Fakes A Story About His Kid Having Autism For Karma,46,166,False,False,False,KarmaCourt,1527516668.0,True,"At the time of this post, approximately 3 days ago a case was filed for a crime that happened 4 days ago. 

What happened was that the defendant, /u/usernamecheckouts13 went on the subreddit /r/FortNiteBR and posted there a story about his son having autism and experiencing joy when winning a game in FortNite. However, sometime later, after the defendant received over 7,000 points of karma, they turned their back to the sub and revealed that the story was a lie to gain free karma. 

This case was filed three days ago and a trial was held. Yet, the prosecutor handling the case unfortunately had to resign and I, one of the case's judges, declared a mistrial along with my fellow judge. 

Now, while the Constitution does say a person can't be tried for the same crime once convicted or acquitted, reminder that the last trial ended in a mistrial. And reminder that a mistrial does not prove or disprove a person's guilt. No verdict against the defendant was given...thus they haven't been acquitted or convicted...thus this post is still legal.

[MFF] I conspired with another girl to surprise my girlfriend while she was tied to the bed and use her until her brain melted [Long] [freeuse] [first threesome] [true love],37,468,True,False,False,gonewildstories,1527496382.0,True,"I wanted to surprise her. It’s difficult, she’s so confident and capable and ready for anything. But then I had an idea. My girlfriend Anna and I have been together for a little over two years, and things are really wonderful. We’re madly in love, and sex keeps getting better, despite my best efforts to frustrate her into oblivion. She likes that, she likes being frustrated and teased and toyed with. She’s a very self possessed woman, very take charge and get things done. But when the bedroom door closes, she’s mine to do with as I please. She gives herself to me in ways I should only be allowed to dream about.

So we experiment a lot, and both really enjoy trying new things. We’ve been doing more role playing lately, especially “teacher-student”, and con-non con type stuff. Really fun…reeeeally fun. She wears this skirt, with pig tails. Jesus. No, that’s for another time, I have to focus.

Her job puts her in a position of power, she has to be responsible for a bunch of people and get shit done. I think that’s why she likes it when I take control in the bedroom. She loves being tied up, so thats what we did on the night of this story. It was a Friday night not too long ago, and I had been teasing her all day with texts and little comments about her “bad” behavior. She’d give me a hard time about needing to do laundry or the like, and I’d grab her ass (her magnificent, beautiful ass) and tell her I was going to tie her up and punish her tonight, to which she’d respond “oh no” with a huge smile. “I’d hate that” in her sexy innocent voice. She had no idea what was coming though. I was finally going to surprise her.

This took a lot of planning, I’ll be honest. We like to talk about what porn we watch or what gets us off when we’re not together. We have weird work schedules and we both have very high sex drives. Anyway, I noticed over the last few months that she had been watching a lot of threesome porn (MMF and FFM). We’ve talked about threesomes, we’re both a little…let’s go with bashful, about it. It will probably happen someday, but for now I thought I would play to one of her other fantasies…being helpless, and being used.

It took a lot of planning. I’ve had this girl in mind for this particular adventure for a while, but honestly, how do you ask someone a question like this? It could ruin the friendship, it could complicated things, it could backfire. I’m still not totally sure, but I bucked up the courage to text her when I was high off my ass on a brownie that was way stronger than I was expecting(I would not recommend this procedure), and it worked. I’m not sure what I even said, the texts got deleted, but she agreed. Apparently she’s “always thought Anna was hottt” (her words, though I agree). Now this was about two months ago, like I said, it took a lot of planning.

We had talked about what to expect and how things were going to work, limits and how to handle different scenarios, pretty far in advance. Anna still had no idea. But the night had arrived, and I was fucking ready.

Here’s the sexy stuff

Around dinner time I told her I had a surprise for her, but she would have to wait until she was tied up. She hates waiting, but loves being teased, so it was a good way to start. At 8, we went to the bedroom and I took off my shirt and made her undress. She hurriedly whipped off her clothes and laid down on her back, and spread her arms and legs. We have a set of restraints that go under the mattress, with cuffs that go around each wrist and ankle. Once she’s tied up, I pull the restraints so she’s really spread across the bed, and check to make sure she can move, but only barely. She’s tried to really rip and pull, but she honestly can’t get free, which is really impressive for such a cheap restraint set. Amazon, free two day shipping. Can’t beat it.

Normally I just tie her up, tease her, touch her, and then use a vibrator on her clit while I finger her g-spot, but refuse to let her cum until she’s really sopping wet and then finally, with my permission she squirts all over the bed. It’s awesome (get a waterproof mattress cover, works wonders. Amazon. free shipping, can’t beat it). But occasionally we’ll use a blindfold. One time we used noise canceling headphones, but she likes being able to hear me, and I like dirty talking to her. But tonight was going to be different. Surprise number one.

I blindfolded her after she was all tied up. She was a little bit cold, and it was obvious. She has the most incredible breasts, they just feel so good in my hands, and her nipples feel so good in my mouth. Then there was a loud “tap tap tap” on the front door. She tensed briefly, and I said, “I have a surprise for you. Emma wants to watch”. She immediately froze and said “what”, but it was too late. I put the noise cancelling headphones on her (Bose QC35s with Bluetooth. These things are insane. Amazon. Two day shipping. Can’t beat it), and as she started to resist against her restraints, saying “what are you talking about, who’s Em-”, I put the ball gag we never use in her mouth. Surprise number two!

Now I’m about as sex positive as a progressive, feminist, liberal man raised Catholic can be. Consent and communication are biggies for me, so before I go any further, let me explain. We usually use the “light” system, Green means go, Yellow means slow down, Red means full stop. But when she can’t talk, we cut to the chase, two taps means tap out, stop, I’m done. This was the moment I was worried about, would she tap out? Was the night over before it began? I waited a beat…nothing. No tap, just an apprehensive looking, beautifully naked, woman on my bed.

Anna doesn’t know Emma, I met her on reddit actually. She’s Anna’s age, they actually went to college together, but I’m quite sure they never met. She’s very pretty, and very much Anna’s ‘type’. But that’s not important right now. What is important, is what we did to my poor helpless tied up girlfriend.

After I let her in, we started getting organized. Toys were laid out, hands were washed (wash your hands people, seriously, it’s always flu season), and last minute ideas shared. We weren’t going to be having sex and we agreed to keep bottoms on, this was just going to be about Anna. It was shock and awe, divide and conquer, brain melting time. I want to tell you what we did to Anna, but I want you to imagine what Anna was thinking. Sensory deprivation has a powerful ability to change how things feel.

I dragged my fingers across Anna’s chest and she yelped. Normally that would earn a light moan at best. Then I leaned in and put my cheek against hers, so she would know it was me. I pulled away, and without missing a beat, Emma leaned forward and kissed her. She laid down fully across Anna, creating contact between them. Anna let out a whimper, and I realized Emma was dragging her finger around Annas breast. Not quite touching, just barely drifting. She placed down her whole hand, cupping Annas breast, and Anna must have noticed how much smaller Emma’s hands were to mine, because her whole body started to shiver. Like when we first started dating and a touch in just the right spot could get a full body shake.

Emma stood up and began to take off her shirt, while I crouched down and wrapped my arm around Annas thigh while kissing her belly, up to the bottom of her breasts. Emma laid down on her side right up next to Anna, her let draping over Anna’s, her hands wandering over Annas chest. Anna gets very warm when she gets excited and Emma told me the heat between them felt amazing, now that skin was touching skin. Anna moaned when she felt Emma rub up next to her. We had planned for this, I reached over and pulled one head phone away from her ear, and immediately, Emma said (in really a very sexy voice) “Hi Anna, it’s nice to meet you, I’m Emma”. Anna was full on shivering now. She does this when she gets really excited. Her breathing was short and fast. “Brian invited me to play with you. He said I could do whatever I wanted with you”. Anna moaned desperately. “I want you to tap the bed once if you’re going to be a good girl and let me use you tonight”. Anna tapped. I put the ear phone back and Anna made a noise, and to calm her, Emma licked Annas face. We were off to the races. I’m a master of surprise.

Emma was drawing her hands all over Annas body, while we took turns kissing her all over. I was focusing on massaging her feet and legs, while Emma sucked and nibbled on her breasts and teased her arms. She was getting visibly wet, so Emma reached down with one hand to tease Anna’s outer lips. At this point it became increasingly difficult for me to focus, but I kept it together. Emma and I really did concentrate exclusively on Anna, not that she could tell (this is not the last story with Emma though, and I’ll leave it at that). Anna was bucking and moaning, way louder than normal, and dripping wet. She was going to cum soon, this wasn’t going to be a long slow build up. I put two fingers inside her while Emma leaned forward and started licking and kissing Anna’s clit. About fifteen seconds later, Anna screamed and her hips came off the bed. She came. Hard. Emma held her close while I kissed around her lips and thighs. She wasn’t done, but she earned a short break.

After a few minutes Emma started licking Anna, just all over. Like a damn popsicle. I took that as my cue to start playing with her pussy lips, just long gentle touches feeling her wetness. I put my thumb inside her, and let my fingers wander further down, my middle finger running across her very pretty little asshole. I pressed up against her and she tensed and sighed. Motioned to Emma to step up her game, her tongue was now flicking Annas nipples, every now and then biting gently (though by Anna’s reactions maybe not that gently). As she did this she would drag her fingernails along Anna’s sides, and as she did this, I pressed my finger inside her ass. She loves this, DP stuff has been rising on her list of sexual favorites. After a little more of this, Emma straddled Annas chest, her ass above Anna’s face (which…I mean, damn. What a sight. Too bad Anna couldn’t see :P ), and positioned herself to start lapping at Anna’s pussy while I fingered her ass. Emma reached around to squeeze Anna’s butt cheeks while licking and sucking on her pussy lips, and I think the combination was just too much. Anna started thrashing, banging her head against the pillow, when she accidentally knocked her head into Emma’s butt, and the headphones came off. I think this surprised Anna because she got very quiet and still.

Emma looked at me with a smile, got up and put her face right next to Anna’s. She whispered “that was very naughty, I thought you were going to be a good slut for me to play with”. Anna was silent, and I still had my finger in her butt. I decided to take the opportunity to start licking her pussy (it just tastes so damn good, what was I supposed to do?), and Anna nuzzled her face against Emma’s while she let out a moan. Emma was pleased, and just said one more thing before putting the headphones back on. She said, “I want to make out with you, but if you so much as say one word, I’m gone”. Anna’s pussy tensed when she said “make out with you”, but other than that she was very still, very tense and very quiet.

Emma took out the gag, and attacked. Anna’s never kissed a girl before (as far as I know), but I think she’s always been curious. Emma was giving her the full experience, tongues were deep in each others mouths, Anna was desperately breathily moaning, trying not to let that count as speaking, Emma was groping her breasts, and as much as I wanted to, quite frankly stare and cum all over Anna while watching them mack on each other, this wasn’t about me. I went to work and ate pussy like I was starving. I licked, I sucked, I nibbled, I kissed, I fingered. I took every trick I could think of, every r/sex article, every Nina Hartley video, every little ounce of knowledge about lady bits, especially these, my most favorite lady bits, and went to town. Anna didn’t stand a chance.

She came hard, for what seemed like an eternity. Emma held her tightly, Anna basically moan/screaming into Emma’s neck while Emma rubbed her head. I tried my best to keep going, but it got pretty wet pretty quick and her hips were all over the place. As the thrashing stopped, she got very tense and froze like that, like she was squeezing every drop of oxytocin out of her brain that she could manage. And then, all at once, her entire body relaxed, and she let out a very deep breath. Emma stayed like that for a moment, then got up, got dressed, kissed her on the cheek, and was gone. I took her place (my place dammit, it’s my bed after all. Actually, I got the mattress on Amazon too…Free shipping. The mail man was a little annoyed, it was really heavy), and untied her arms and legs. She didn’t have the strength to move right away, I pulled her against me and wrapped my arms around her. She couldn’t speak, she just did this sort of mumbly, smiling giggle. I took off her blind fold and she just looked up at me, and I kid you not, the first thing she said was “I love you”. I love you too.

My diet has consisted of junk food. I fluctuate between 235 and 240. At probably 25-30% body fat. I want to change that. 



So I got on the floor and did 20 push-ups. Followed by spelling the alphabet with my legs. Then a 30 second flutterkicks. Then 10 more pushupa

Then twenty 25 pound curls. (I know it's not bodyweight so if this needs to be removed then then let me know where I can post this.)

I then got lightheaded. And sort of tried to lie down on the floor because I knew I was going to faint but more of blacked out halfway there and crashed into the ground sideways.


I rewakened probably 30 seconds later and proceeded to just breath a fuck ton while laying on the ground for 30 minutes while my heart slowed.


I'm so damn ashamed of where I've put my body. I can't belive I put it in this state of weakness. But I want to change it.
So what workouts should I be focusing on? And yes I'm fixing my diet.

So they interview me and they hire me same day. They ask when I can start working, I say, “Hey I have three important school events (that are required of my classes) coming up at dates: x, y, and z, and then I also have graduation in 2 months...so I can start after date Z or start now and request those days off. I’m not too sure if you want me doing that as a new employee though.” The manager is like no problem dude! You’re hired, and I’m going to give you those days off and graduation right now. So I’m like cool cool.

So fast forward to when I start working. On the second day I’m working with the assistant manager and she’s giving me the lowdown. and she says to me: “I’m also in charge of the schedules, and I see you have requested days off already. Listen, this is retail and fair or not I can’t guarantee you weekends off. managers and assistant managers get first pick on days off.” So I’m sitting there like okayyyy, so is she not going to give me these days off the manager said I would get off? I was worried she wouldn’t even give me my own graduation off. 

6 days in I HATED the place. I have never worked retail that was so bad like that before. So I quit. I called in and said I quit. The assistant manager called me and is like “well you’re already scheduled to cover my lunch at A and B date.” So I said to her “Sorry I can’t guarantee I’ll be there to cover your lunch.”

"Another an example of ""leaving out the truth,"" Elder Renlund gives a talk about Orson and Parley Pratt reconciling b/c of geneology, fails to say they fought b/c of polygamy.",27,330,False,False,False,exmormon,1527512612.0,True,"Yesterday when I brought my son, I decided to give the talks half a listen.  One was on repentance, the other temples, and the other was the church's talk by Renlund and how the Pratt brothers, Orson and Parley, reconciled over genealogy. The speaker says that the brothers were not speaking, though the talk ""does not say why."" 

I decided to research a little, because I knew about Orson's wife, Sarah Pratt, who left the church over polygamy and Joseph Smith making advances to her while Orson was on a mission from Joseph.  

It turns out that Orson and Parley had a big blow\-up in the temple on the subject, because Parley believed that Orson's wife Sarah had tattled. Apparenlty, Sarah had informed Parley's wife that Parley was a polygamist, or at least that he'd had relations with the family maid.

The ""spiritual wife"" she told Parley's wife about was Parley's FOURTH plural wife, who Parley had married while on a mission and brought home to be a maid. His legal wife Mary Ann had known about none of them until Sarah told her.  She eventually divorced Parley.

 Here's a source:

""Pratt had secretly married Belinda Marden on 20 November 1844 and  travelled with her to New York. His first wife, Mary Ann, who remained  in Nauvoo, knew nothing of her husband’s plural marriage. Also unknown  to Mary Ann were three other marriages to Elizabeth \[p.xii\]Brotherton in  1843 and to Mary Wood and Hannette Snively in 1844. Returning to  Nauvoo, Belinda joined Pratt’s household as a maid. She became pregnant  that winter.

In January 1846, Parley and Orson Pratt publicly argued in the newly  completed Nauvoo temple over accusations Parley had made against Orson’s  wife, Sarah. Orson and Sarah had quarreled with church officials ever  since Joseph Smith reportedly approached Sarah in 1842, while Orson was  in England, with a proposal of plural marriage. Shortly before Parley’s  and Orson’s dispute, Sarah had informed Mary Ann of Belinda’s and  Parley’s relationship. Mary Ann confronted Belinda and, after learning  the truth, left Parley. They formally divorced seven years later.

In the temple Parley accused Sarah of “ruining and breaking up his  family,” as well as of being an apostate. Parley’s and Orson’s argument  became so intense that Orson was voted out of the temple.

### What is SimpleAlerts?
SimpleAlerts is an open source, streaming tool that helps organize your Streamlabs events by using meaningful filters and groupings. As streamers, we ALL know how important it is to be active with our community and give shoutouts almost immediately. As you start receiving more and more alerts it gets harder to keep up with the onslaught of these shoutouts. That's where SimpleAlerts comes in.

This free, open source tool built on top of Streamlabs' system (huge shoutout to them for great API docs \m/) helps you by doing multiple things:

- Organize certain events into certain sections
- Give priority to events that need immediate attention
- Show which events have been read already and which have not

**NOTE: SimpleAlerts currently only supports Twitch login and has only been tested on Google Chrome web browser. As this application is currently in beta, I would appreciate any and all bugs/feedback reported [here](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts/issues)! This will help keep SimpleAlerts going!**

### Organize Your Events
On Twitch we receive many different events- follows, subscriptions, cheers, donations, hosts, and raids. Currently, SimpleAlerts supports the following events: follows, subscriptions, cheers, and donations. The current event list shown by Streamlabs shows every event within a single section as well as events you may not care to receive. While this is definitely helpful, I believe there is a much more intuitive way of doing this. By selecting which events you want shown (or not shown) in each section, SimpleAlerts helps you organize what you are looking at and keeps your most important events at the forefront of your stream. Take a look at the demo [here](https://media.giphy.com/media/e7OTRjKY94fbu7kigj/giphy.gif) to see this type of sectioning in action!

### Prioritize Events
This was a pinnacle feature I wanted SimpleAlerts built upon. This idea really came to life by watching large streamers constantly lose track of their event list. If you have ever watched Dr. Disrespect, you have definitely heard him say how he can't keep up or loses his place during shout outs. This is why this feature is so important. Each event has a set of filters that you are able to apply to each section that will highlight incredible events during your streaming session. 

For example, let's say you have your cheer event setup and you want to know when someone cheers over 1000 bits? Easily set that by entering it into the ""Bump By Bits"" option, and when you receive a cheer that is 1000 bits or more, your event will automatically be pushed to the top of the list AND highlighted yellow! Now let's say you received that cheer event, but something else happened and you have not shouted that person out yet. Every event list has an option to set the ""Bump By Time"". This means you can automatically bump events that have been waiting for x amount of minutes to the top of your list! At the moment of writing this post, Streamlabs does not hav any sort of feature like this. Take a look at the demo [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3fde6nns1zw7q38/BitBump.mov?dl=0) to see it in action!

### Know Who You Shout Out
Everything about events goes back to the viewers. These are the people that support you and keep you motivated to stream. Being able to keep track of who you have or have not shouted out is key. SimpleAlerts helps you do this with ease. As soon as you are done shouting someone out, just click the event cell and it will automatically go to the bottom of the list, turn green, and add an option to completely remove it from your section's list. This feature gives you multiple ways to organize your events in the way that is the best for your streaming style. Again, at the time of writing this post, Streamlabs does not offer anything like this. Take a look [here](https://media.giphy.com/media/3KXbhJTiHhvIJS4uka/giphy.gif) to see a demo of this feature! 

### Open Source &amp; Contributing
You read it right! SimpleAlerts is a 100% free and a fully open source platform. This means that anyone is able to get access to the code, contribute features or even make their own apps based off of the logc in SimpleAlerts. The reason I started streaming was to show others my process for building applications and hopefully inspire people to get invovled in programming and streaming it on Twitch. This project is able to help you get your feet wet with web development and contributing to an open source project! I want to see others succeed and I hope this project can do just that.
To get started contributing to SimpleAlerts, head over to the [Github Repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts) to find out exactly how you can get invovled!

### Final Thoughts
While these were only some of the awesome features behind SimpleAlerts, there are many more smaller pieces that bring the user experience of this app together. I have been so excited to share this with everyone here and I do hope that you find this tool helpful during your streaming career. Again, SimpleAlerts is still growing and is looking for constructive feedback from the people that use it! Please feel to submit any sort of feedback or issues at anytime.

Playing HotS almost killed me,156,542,False,False,False,heroesofthestorm,1527502383.0,True,"I lose track of time in here, but last week Tuesday, maybe around 9:30 pm or so, I was just trying to get a few Ranked games in for the night.  The last one on Cursed Hollow didn't look so great, me solo tanking on Anub with a Murky on my team split pushing through us losing the first curse in the game, but whatever it's mid-Gold and not like I'm a superstar.  I couldn't tell you how now, but we managed to come back in the late game and win somehow. But that's not really the point of the story.  

What I remember with crystal clarity is everyone starting to GG in chat with the win.   I start typing mine in....and my chest starts to squeeze. And it didn't stop.  In the space of a few seconds the squeeze became a vice grip.  A few seconds more and that became the worst and most terrifying pain I ever felt in my life. And it wouldn't stop. 

Right when it started, my animal brain told me whatever was happening was REALLY bad, and right away it flashed in my head that I was having a heart attack. But then my rational brain took over and pointed out that this isn't possible, you just turned 40, no family heart history, you are being treated for mild GERD, you have anxiety, so this is just acid reflux and your brain twisting it all up. 

I suffered through pain for the next few hours trying to convince myself to call the ambulance out. I mean, I didn't clutch my chest and fall over face first like you see people doing on TV. I could still walk and talk, blood wasnt frothing out of mouth or anywhere else.  And I thought that if an ambulance came out, said it's reflux, here's an antacid, then I just killed someone who really needed it. 

So instead of calling 999 for the ambulance, I kept trying to get through on 111, the nonemergency number. When I finally did, the person on the line went through the the list of all the symptoms and said, ""I'm getting an ambulance to come to your home.""

Paramedics got there, did an ECG which they said looked fairly normal, but given all the other circumstances they wanted to take me in.  So after a short, very nauseating ride to A and E, I was admitted somewhere around 12:30am Wednesday. 

After going through more ECGs and lots of blood work, I finally made my sleepless way all they through to a bed in Resusc, I think.  Still in tons of pain, for which the doctor gave me one or two full vials of morphine?  My memory of that night is really shot to hell. But around 5:30 or 6:00 am, the doctor finally gave me some results. 

He said that my ECGs all along the way had been mostly normal, but there were still some small abnormalities. He also told me that one of the blood tests looking for a specific protein indicative of a heart attack was over 5000.  Given the other events and symptoms, there was no doubt that I'd had a heart attack. 

I had him say it again just to be sure, but I knew it the first time as I started crying then.  It was a mix of shock but also utter relief that I wasn't making this all up in my head. 

Admitted to HCU not long after that. Had an echocardiogram the next day that showed damage to two arteries and one of my valves. Had an angioplasty the next day to put two stents into my circumflex artery to clear a blockage, and finally pain free in my chest the last two days tho still running a fever that's keeping me here, typing this in the very tranquil Dementia Garden space. 

In the end all, wtf does this really have to do with HotS you ask?   In part, it's just strangely cathartic to write about all of this. But mostly, I just want to ask players who might be like me to be careful and watch for the symptoms and get treated before you become me. 

I've played since Alpha, totally new to Mobas. Made every stupid mistake possible when learning, but managed to get my EU account to Rank 1 solo queuing. Never been Master, in fact my ranks have probably gone down consistently every season, and been banned loads of time for bad chat. I'm just a typical player, not special. 

But I love the game. And I hate the game. But it had me hooked. And when I played, I did in fact try hard. And looking back now, I realize I was in fact stressing my body while playing. I'd have my jaw clenched for 20 minutes. I'd grind ranked during a losing streak to keep from launching the laptop. I'd type bad things and be mad and stressed when my teammates didn't put in the same effort. My wrist and shoulders would ache. And even after wins, I didn't feel good, it was more just relief that I didn't lose. 

All of this is my fault by the way, I own it. I also know the odds of me changing that intensity in ranked games are slim to none. Tougher to keep up with the kids' reflexes and all that as an old man at 40.  I mean, like Coach Edwards said, ""You play to win the game....hello?!? You play to win the game. You don't play to just play it.""

If any of that sounds familiar to you while playing, I just ask you to take care. It wasn't until doctors asked me to think about it that I realized ordinary tasks had indeed been tougher for me to do and that I'd been getting tired far more easily than usual. I just thought it was because I was 40 and out of shape. The signs were there all along that trouble was possible. The game just put me over the top.  If any parts of my story ring true with you, just take a moment and think about your health, please. Especially if you're a gamer closer or over my age

HotS, when I had games where both teams were highly skilled players and all played hard, was the best gaming experience I've ever had. I've always treated it like a version of 5v5 battlegrounds from WoW refined rather than a Moba. Maybe the Devs always have too, who knows.  But HotS is also the most stressful game I've ever played, and after this, I know I can't play it ever again. 

So no rage quit this time, can't afford those physically anymore. More like retirement I guess. Would have loved to see if PBMMR ever fixed matchmaking. But off to greener and healthier pastures for me now. And please do take care of yourselves if any of this rings true with you.

Thanks for your time today. :-)

Neighbours spying on me (F) with drone!,42,187,False,False,False,legaladvice,1527522645.0,True,"I suspect that one of my neighbours has been spying on me \(or everyone\) for, at least, the past 2 weeks.  I don't have concrete proof of this but the suspicion is strong enough to have me worried.

Let's start with what I know for sure,  I'm certain that I caught the jerk in the act last night but I have no way of knowing how long this has been going on.   I moved into my house last fall so this is the first summer I've spent in my new place. Since the weather has gotten nice, I've fallen into the routine of spending about 30 minutes to an hour on my back porch before I go to bed every night.  Last night, I was sitting outside on my porch, like usual, when I became aware of a red light in the sky. I assumed it was a plane or a satellite but then it zoomed out of my line of vision.  I lost track of it for a while but it came back a few minutes later.  This time it was a bit lower and right above me so I stood up and looked directly at it. Suddenly, the damn thing took off and landed into one the backyards on the next street over but  I couldn't see exactly which house.

When that happened, I realised that I've been subconsciously aware of the red light for a couple of weeks now. I'm sure I've seen it outside at night and outside my window while I try to fall asleep.  Also, I've been pretty naive with my privacy... we don't have blinds yet and I don't wear pyjamas.  To top it off, our AC had been broken until last Thursday so me and my husband had been walking around our bedroom naked.    Best case scenario, it's just a kid messing around.  I can live with that, I'll just get some friggin blinds.  But, my fear is that this creeper has footage of us naked and is uploading it on the internet.

What legal steps should I take at this point?  Should I wait for him/her/them to do it again, should I wait until I know which house it came from  or should I just report what I've seen so far?  FYI, I live in Ontario, Canada.

Edit:   Thanks for the links and advice so far!  A big question I have is, if I find out who this person is and I suspect that they have video files of me on their computer, could I somehow get the cops to seize the computer and  remove those files?  "

I'm not close enough or friendly enough with her to comfortably say ""Gurl, you stink"" as I would with a good friend, and it seems somehow juvenile to approach management about it. And she's such a sweet lady that I really don't want to hurt her feelings. What would you do in this situation?"

Muslim Activists Hack ISIS Mailing List,25,264,False,False,False,hacking,1527505978.0,True,"Muslim activists ‘hack Isis mailing list after terrorists claimed that it was un\-hack\-able’  
It was claimed by Terrorists that their systems were Un\-hack\-able but now Muslim hackers claim they have attacked to Isis’s network and they recently published almost 2,000 subscribers’ email addresses list in the latest online blow **“caliphate”**.

They said that a message appeared on Friday night claiming that security had been increased After numerous cyber attacks and official take\-downs targeting its Amaq \(a “news agency”\).

Here is the Actual message:

&gt;“In response to recent events, we have imposed more stringent security measures on our systems,” said the email in Arabic. “We can now handle email attacks or any type of hack.”

Muslim hacking collective **“Di5s3nSi0N”**, they said that automated email service last month disabled by them, \(“**challenge accepted**”\). Less than three hours later, they sent out another email to Amaq subscribers, but this time they display hackers’ logo with a warning.

&gt;“We have hacked the full ‘secure’ email list for Amaq,”

it said.

&gt;“Daesh…shall we call you dogs for your crimes or snakes for your cowardice? We are the bugs in your system.”

The email contained almost a list of 1,784 subscribers’ their email addresses, which were redacted and have been partially verified by hackers.

I’m out,51,186,False,False,False,DeadBedrooms,1527512605.0,True,"After 12 years together I finally decided to pull the pin. We had many problems but the underlying issue was her absolute indifference to sex.

Four weeks ago we had a big argument. She ended up getting physically violent with me. She didn’t realise at the time that I was already considering divorce. The violence was just the final straw for me. 

We had a few good years to begin with, but everything quickly fell apart when we married. I waited 7 years for her to change, but like many of us here her excuses generally were blame games directed at me. I was miserable in my marriage and I felt very unattractive and undesirable.

After leaving the marriage I quickly learned that I was desirable and attractive. I have had an amazing night with a new girl and it proved to me that there are people out there happy even thrilled to have sex with me. They actually feel lucky to be with me. 

I’ve never felt better. I should have left earlier. Don’t waste your best years if it doesn’t feel right."

"I work at a hotel. Last night, I saw something strange on the security footage.",13,106,False,False,False,nosleep,1527533517.0,True,"I work the night shift at the Southfield Inn. Other than handling late check\-ins, I’m supposed to keep an eye on the security footage. I’ve seen my fair share of “strange” occurrences – drunk kids trying to break into the pool area at 2 am, a sweet little old lady having sex with her husband in the elevator.

But nothing like last night.

At around 3:30 am, while microwaving dinner, I checked the security cams. To my surprise, there were two people – a man and a woman – getting on the elevator. The man was wearing a tattered leather jacket and black gloves. The woman had blonde hair and pink lipstick. She looked like she had been crying for hours, mascara and red ringing her eyes.

He pressed the button for floor 4.

I switched the camera to 4. The elevator doors slid open, and they stepped out into the hall. Blondie still looked miserable, and Leather Jacket had his arm looped around her hips as if he owned her.

He gestured to one of the doors to his left.

And that's when I realized –

Every single door was open.

Now, we have self\-closing doors, so someone must have propped the doors open – or been holding them that way. The lights were off in each room, and the dark doorways stretched down the hallway, seeming to never end.

Blondie and Leather Jacket walked down the hallway. He was saying something to her, and she was slowly nodding, but I couldn’t tell what.

Now, I knew some of those rooms were occupied. So why weren't they *doing* anything? Why weren't they fluttering around in confusion, asking who the hell opened their door at 3:30 am?

But I didn't have much time to wonder.

Because the lights flickered, and then went out.

The screen was black.

My heart was pounding, now, so loudly that I could hear it in the silence of the room. I shook the mouse with sweaty fingers, as if that could somehow prod the lights back on.

Finally, they flicked back on.

All the doors were closed, now.

But now Leather Jacket was carrying something. A small bag. It must’ve been filled with something heavy, because he leaned to one side as he continued down the hallway.

They got back in the elevator. Blondie was sobbing, now, her head in her hands. He turned to her, and began talking. I turned on the microphone, and listened:

“… done now. All we gotta do is take care of the girl at the front desk, and destroy the security footage.”

The blood drained from my head.

And then I bolted up. I ran out of the hotel, into the darkness. In front of me stood Route 52, still as a country path; the neon lights of the town below shimmered, like twinkling little stars.

I ran towards the town. At the 24\-Hour\-Diner, I called the police.

\-\-\-

When they got there, Blondie and Leather Jacket were gone, as was the security footage.

And every single person who occupied floor 4 was missing. The loud family on their way to Disney world. The Don Juan and his two lady friends. The old lady with the dog, and the Metallica guy with the loud headphones.

All vanished.

They did find one thing, though.

A Southfield napkin. Written in pink lipstick were the words:

My Top 10 FF Tips,59,141,False,False,False,fantasyfootball,1527517134.0,True,"
Hey guys, I wrote the following little tidbit of info and it may seem like overkill but it’s been a huge help every year for me. 

Every year we spend hours or research, spend money on subscriptions for analysis and overthink our decisions until our eyes bleed. Why I’m writing this is because we all look for that extra piece of information that can lead us to the elusive championship or that inside scoop that your league missed out on. These factors IMO have been the biggest help in being consistent:
 

1) You won’t win your draft in the first round, but you can lose it. Pick safe. High ceiling, high floor guys. Don’t get cute, just pick the BPA here.

.

2) Past performance =/= future results. Even your top tier guys can have a fallout year (Check 2016 Gurley and Hopkins). You might have a bust on your squad, don’t be afraid to bench guys who are underperforming even if you invested a high pick into them.

.

3) F/O and Coaching/scheme changes. This is more underappreciated than people think and have a direct correlation to point 2. When a new coach or OC comes in, they may want to change how they play, the players they prefer and how they choose to invest their time/money. This works for defenses as well. You know what they say, if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Well if it’s being fixed, don’t expect the same results.

.

4) Stay active on the waiver wire. This is crucial. If you are not active, you will shoot yourself in the foot. Many of the top players in the past few years were waiver wire claims (David Johnson, Alvin Kamara etc). This will make or break you.

.

5) Watch some preseason games. This will give you insight to the depth of a team and potential sleepers/backups who could be a great waiver wire steal.

.

6) Draft as late as possible (Late Aug/Early Sept). Many people get eager and want to do it sooner than later. Guys get injured in preseason. Don’t be that guy who invests a pick into the IR pool.

.

7) Ignore bye weeks, pay attention to schedule. Don’t overthink how many players have the same bye week. Just play your best players and figure it out when you get there. If you draft well enough, you shouldn’t have many holes to fill. Schedule/divisions can make a difference. Pay attention to matchups, nobody is matchup proof.

.

8) Pick players that will get volume. RBs on teams that win more often will close out games. WRs on teams that play from behind will get garbage time volume. Doesn’t matter how you get the points, as long as you get them.

.

9) Offensive balance. Can the team throw and run the ball effectively? For example, Bell and Zeke and both projected top 5 picks. They both have great upside. I would take Bell over Zeke in most drafts due to the offensive balance in PIT opposed to DAL.

.

10) How is the O-Line? This in my opinion is the basis for a successful offensive player in FF. The better the O-Line, the more time the QB gets to throw to his WRs. Also, the more holes and space the RB will get. Look from last years best teams, you will notice that most of their O-Lines were rated at the top.
 


Some of this will seem like common sense, some of it not. There are no statistics or detailed analysis of players. Everything above is transferrable year in and year out. If this information has helped anyone, then I’ve done my part. Good Luck this season!

"For boss fights in gaming, do you prefer epic, massive-sized bosses or smaller, human/player-sized bosses?",59,124,False,False,False,truegaming,1527519988.0,True,"This is something I've been thinking about as I've been playing God of War and Dark Souls: Remastered. Both games have some pretty fun boss fights and the bosses are typically either giant-sized monsters (the trolls in God of War, O&amp;S in DS etc) or human-sized warriors (Magni/Modi in GoW, Artorias in DS for e.g.). 

I'm finding that I typically enjoy the smaller-sized bosses much more. Although the monsters have their appeal, in that the fights feel epic and you feel like David vs Goliath taking down a being many times bigger than yourself. However, there's something just very innately appealing about the smaller bosses. They feel more like a duel, a fight between equals that gets my adrenaline pumping. I find that for the bigger bosses, the experience almost feels a little detached as they're so outsized - you're just running around avoiding AoE attacks and getting in a hit here and there. That doesn't mean they're not fun, and in fact, can be quite fantastic in their own right, but I just get that same personal feeling that I do with he ""human"" sized bosses. They feel like a gladiatorial duel. The fight against The Stranger/Baldur in GoW and the fight against Artorias in DS are two of the best boss fights I can remember in recent memory.

Anyone else feel the same?"

How I Stumbled Into The Military,12,120,False,False,False,MilitaryStories,1527519309.0,True,"This Memorial Day weekend marks 30 years since I flew into Orlando, FL to begin basic training.

Thirty. Years.

Where the hell has all the time gone?

This isn't a story about basic training (tl;dr: Culture shock, push-ups, 0-dark-30 reveille, push-ups, inspections, push-ups, marching, pushups, classes, push-ups, graduation!).

No... this is how I accidentally joined the US military.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was winter of 1988. Your intrepid author was a young lad, out of high school, working a dead-end job as a burger flipper in McD's, and had no goddamned idea what he was going to do with his life.

At the time, I was hanging out with people of... questionable character, to put it diplomatically. One guy would pull people over for fun, using a fake badge, a police light, and his authority as a grill manager for McDs (he was arrested a year after I left, for burglary). Another thought it would be a fun idea to summon a demon using lyrics he found in a Slayer album (spoiler alert: it doesn't work). A third person thought it would be fun to get me drunk and try to take advantage of me (she had a crush on me... but she overestimated my alcohol tolerance and was unaware I'm a goofy drunk, more prone to pranks and laughing than anything approaching sexy-time).

Directionless... clueless... young and stupid (well, ""unwise"" is probably more accurate)... a perfect target for a military recruiter.

One day, a Navy person called. He sounded reasonable: just take this test and see how you do. No mention was made of joining or signing away my life... just a challenge.

I should mention that tests are kind of ""my thing."" I have never suffered from test anxiety, I can pass a test with minimal studying (though I tend towards putting in more than minimal studying for the A). Most of the reason I passed high school was tests, and I hated homework with the blind fury of a rabid badger on meth.

""Sure,"" I said. ""I'll give it a go.""

My Navy scores were somewhere in the 90s. My tech scores in that area were very high; if you have seen me on /r/talesfromtechsupport, or some of my previous stories on this sub, this shouldn't be a surprise.

""Hey, that's pretty impressive,"" Mr. Recruiter said when I saw him next. ""I would like you to take this other test, and see what else you may qualify for.""

""Okay,"" I said. I was expecting to just take a quick quiz, find out I was qualified for a few things, see where I should go from there.

Instead, I showed up, took the test, got talked into going for a physical... next thing I know, I'm signing stacks of paper that say I'm joining the Navy.

At the point I realized what I was doing, I paused for a moment and weighed my options.

On the one hand, I could bounce around my home, get arrested or molested, and basically move backwards in life.

...**OR** I could go into the Navy, see the world, ride on a big boat, and write about it later.

(I had not yet learned that, with tech scores as high as I had, I would not be able to sign on as a Navy journalist. I still consider that their loss.)

So, I continued putting my signature on papers that guaranteed me a single meal and one hour of sleep a night.

One month later, I was on a plane to Orlando, FL for basic. We sat in a barracks for the entirety of Memorial Day weekend. Thanks, Albany MEPS, for trashing that weekend for the 6 of us that were there from Friday to Monday waiting for the rest of the training company.

There are times when I kind of feel bad about how I joined. It wasn't ""for my country,"" it wasn't ""to keep myself out of trouble,"" or any noble purpose. It was an accident, and the noble purpose kind of filled itself in later.

Strange Cosmology Part 91,15,182,False,False,False,Hydrael_Writes,1527511079.0,True,"Zeus sat dead on his throne. He looked almost peaceful, his head bowed, the great white beard stained red by the hole in his chest where his attacker had stabbed him. Artemis was doing her best to look at the situation with a detachment, even though it was hard seeing him like this. Zeus may have been a randy old bastard, but he’d guided the pantheon for as long as she could remember. *He didn’t expect the attack.* 

That much was obvious. Zeus was as dangerous as they came, the rise of his divinity marked with the battles against the Titans and then followed by centuries of Theomachy to bring the rest of the old Olympians in line. He’d helped find divinity for both his brothers, even going so far as to find how to help an Underworld god ascend for Hades sake, something no one had understood \- at least, as far as Artemis knew. He’d later gone to war with them and neither Hades or Poseidon were exactly pushovers. He’d survived the Bronze Age collapse, he’d survived the war against the Egyptians and the Persians. 

The only warriors as skilled as him, and the only gods as powerful, were Hades, Poseidon, and Hera. Hades had remained in his realm instead of coming with them to the Elysian rest. Hera was currently screaming vengeance for this fowl betrayal. *So where are you, Poseidon?* 

“Where is his Nanoverse?” Hera shouted, startling Artemis out of her thoughts. She was looking at Artemis as she screamed it, but Artemis didn’t think the question was directed at her, especially since Hera didn’t deem to wait for an answer before continuing. “He always had it on him, *always.* If we find his nanoverse, we find his killer.”

“Then I suggest we gather everyone. Check them. See who has two. We’ll have our killer then,” Artemis responded, trying to keep her voice as calm as she was her emotions. Hera didn’t need someone to rage with her right now. She needed someone who could stay calm. 

Of course, now carrying around Ares nanoverse was a much bigger liability than it had been. Artemis still trusted her gut instinct to lie about that to Hera, but if the enraged god\-queen found out that Artemis was carrying two now...*I don’t think any amount of bold moves will save me then.*

“Oh, you suggest that, do you?” Hera snapped, her voice dripping with vitriol so thick Artemis wondered if they’d need to mop it up before it tainted the crime scene. She opened her mouth to respond, but Hera wasn’t actually looking for an answer. “Don’t just suggest it, then! Go! Do it. I’m sick of councils, sick of talking. Give me action!”

“And what if I find myself against someone who could kill Zeus? Would you have me fight whomever killed your husband?”

Hera’s nostrils flared. Artemis had never understood how a marriage built upon so much mutual acrimony could contain so much love. Hera seemed to do nothing when it came to her husband except than complain about his infidelities, and Zeus rarely spoke of Hera except to grumble about her attempts to kill his ex lovers and children, but whenever they were together they were the perfect picture of a happy couple. Artemis had thought it was as sham, a show for the other Olympians, but seeing Hera’s rage now...*you do love him.* 

“No, of course I won’t,” Hera said after she’d calmed down. “Of course you can’t fight them. You’re a good archer, but you’re no match for anyone who could do this. Especially because we *know* who it was, don’t we?”

“We do?” Artemis asked.

“Of course. Poseidon, and probably his cow Thalassa. He was always jealous of Zeus, and she always believed she’d be a better Queen than I. They’re using the opportunity of Moloch to seize power. It’s obvious.”

It wasn’t to Artemis. Poseidon and Zeus had gotten along poorly in the past, true, but betraying them to Moloch? That seemed beyond even him \- if nothing else, he would be too proud to resort to trickery. Thalassa, meanwhile, had said she’d been a better Queen than Hera. That was true. But she always said it with the unspoken implication of “and if *I’m* saying I would do better, than you know how poorly I think she’s doing.” Comparing herself was a critique of Hera, not an actual desire. “We should check them first then,” Artemis said. If they found Zeus’ nanoverse it would answer the question, and put Hera’s paranoia to rest if they did not.

That, at least, Hera agreed to, and she stalked the halls of the Rest as Artemis followed. They wound through the great garden, where Ionian columns supported a garden tended by Demeter that was as lush as her power could manage. 

Artemis hoped that once this whole business with Moloch was done, the gardens remained undamaged. They were slightly inspired by the hanging gardens that had once adorned Babylon, but Demeter had carefully given them a perfectly natural appearance, where it gave the impression that all this wonder and beauty had happened by accident \- and at the same time was clearly sculpted by an expert hand. The flowers that grew here formed a perfectly contrasted rainbow of color, and from experience Artemis knew that from the sky above it looked like a kaleidoscope, especially at the artificial evenings they had created in here. During that time, they would open and close to create a swirling pattern that spiraled across the entire span of the garden.

So renowned was their beauty that as they wound through, Hera stopped her stomping to step carefully. It gave her a chance to calm down, and Artemis watched her as she did. Hera’s hands were shaking, her shoulders were slumped, her head was bowed. Artemis thought for a moment it was grief, but why would she be grieving her husband? He’d be back soon. Possibly even tomorrow, given the killer had only created a single hole.  *And why didn’t the killer burn his body? Remove his head? Do something to delay his resurrection further?*

It wasn’t adding up to Artemis. Something was wrong, she was missing a detail somewhere. 

It was something to puzzle over later. They were arriving at Posideon’s chambers. The great sea god was in many ways his brother’s mirror, although his build was slighter and his beard was even more resplendent that Zeus’ “Hera! Artemis!” He asked in a jovial tone. “What brings you to my little corner of paradise?” 

“Where. Is. It?” Hera snapped. *Guess we’re not even attempting subtly,* Artemis sighed. 

Poseidon look puzzled. “Where is what, my queen?”

Hera didn’t bother answering with words. With a gesture, before Poseidon had time to prepare himself, she twisted reality. Poseidon was hurled by a complex weaving of all five elements. A burst of air wrapped him up and slammed him against the wall with such force the stone cracked under the impact. Poseidon started to reach out, but Artemis’ mouth went dry as the water was sucked out of the air to throw off his balance and force him to try and deal with the distraction of it flooding into his lungs, where Artemis could see it still swirled in miniature whirlpools. Bands of the stone rose to encase his wrists and ankles and face and crawling over his torso. Under those bands were strands of fire searing his flesh, and if not for the torrent in his lungs, Artemis was sure she’d hear him scream. Artemis had never even attempted a weaving that complex and Hera had done it like it was *nothing.*

She remembered something Ishtar had said, back when she was with Athena and somewhat welcomed on Olympus. That the elements were just their perceptions of the mathematics that underlies reality. Artemis had laughed it off, asking her if she’d been spending time with the Pythagoreans, but now that she saw what Hera could do, she wondered if maybe Ishtar had a point. Certainly that was no normal elemental work.

Hera strode over to Poseidon's bed and began to tear it apart. Artemis thought to protest what was happening to Poseidon until his guilt was determined, but seeing the wild look in Hera’s eyes, she decided not to make herself a target of her Queen’s wrath. “A\-ha!” Hera shouted, holding the nanoverse high. The one eye Poseidon had that was not covered with burning stone widened in shock instead of pain. “I knew it was you, Poseidon.” She glanced over at Artemis. “Execute this traitor. I want you to shoot him until your quiver is empty.”

Artemis reached back to her quiver, drawing an arrow, and unslung her bow. What had she thought earlier? *I’m sorry, Athena. Unless I do something drastic, you’re on your own.*

Artemis knocked the arrow, then whirled to face Hera. “Don’t. Move. If you even begin to weave reality, my Queen, I’m putting this between your eyes.”

Hera went stock still, her eyes narrowing. “Artemis. What is the meaning of this?”

“When I found you, you were half mad. Whoever killed Zeus couldn’t bear to destroy his body and delay his resurrection. The only way to manage something as complex as what you did to Poseidon was if you already came here and laid the groundwork for it.”

“You accuse me?” Hera asked, her voice venomous. “Put down that bow now, Artemis. Put it down this instant, and we will talk about this.”

“I will, my Queen, if you can answer one question for me.” Artemis’ hands didn’t waiver. This bow was built for a goddess, with a one thousand pound draw. The arrows each weighed more than a sword. She couldn’t take Hera in a straight fight, but if she loosed the arrow in this close proximity she wouldn’t have to.

“Fine, then. I explain everything you’ve mentioned, so ask your question and then we can discuss overlooking your little\-”

Artemis cut her off. “How did you know the nanoverse was in the bed?” 

Hera’s mouth snapped shut, and she gave Artemis a look filled with hatred, terror, and grief. “I can explain,” the Queen of the Olympians said, and if the situation was less dire, Artemis would have found humor in Hera repeating the phrase Zeus had so often used on her.

“I can't believe you'd serve Moloch,"" Artemis spat.

""Don't be ridiculous!"" Hera almost stepped forward, then stopped before Artemis loosed the arrow. ""Artemis, I didn't do this to serve him. Lower the bow and I will explain.""

""No. Release Poseidon and talk,” Artemis said, not moving an inch. *Which means that even after this, there's still the traitors to deal with.* Artemis fought back despair, focusing on the task in front of her.

Hera nodded."

Our Feedback &amp; Demands, have always been struggling to see the light, not talking about Black Desert alone, it a continuous story of the same observations, that get repeated on pretty much any eastern MMO, including my favorites ones.

Over time, i came to the answer eventually, which i'll be sharing on this thread, not expecting much, seeing how my last one turned out.

I want you to take few sec, to remember what were the most up-voted topics in the last couple of days : 

- https://old.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/8lax3b/hystria_h??kers_are_being_left_unchecked_and_have/?utm_term=ba4df310-67ac-47b2-a78a-fb6cd7e72ef3&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=blackdesertonline&amp;utm_content=5 Hackers running wild - 702 Upvotes.

Now, it's fair to assume the community isn't pleased about plenty of what's going on, plenty of other topics are portraying the same negative vibe, which is why the community have voiced their unsatisfaction.


Thing is, words alone aren't enough, which is why some peoples went for a more understandable language : $$, the following threads were made.

- https://old.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/8l5vt7/worldwide_boycott_hosted_by_lacari_and_hikki/ Boycott Pearls - 63 Down-votes.


- https://old.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/8k5cho/boycott_pearls/ Boycott - 29 down-votes.


- https://old.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/8jw4qm/if_you_want_to_protest_the_changes_then_dont/ Stop $$ Support -19 Down-votes.


As you can see, the community isn't just **Passively crying** without actions, but **Actively discouraging** those going for action.


Just Curious, **How are you guys planing to push for improvements ?** I am very interested in your big picture kind of plan. Are you simply passively waiting for a miracle ? Hoping the company would change their ways, even tho we had 0 sign of such a thing during this entire journey.


Some denials users, might list up the couples changes community asked and received, like : 

- Stat visibility : This wasn't us, it's a consequence of Koreans actively protesting &amp; boycotting Pearls, Source : http://www.inven.co.kr/board/black/4123/4049 deleted for now, but you can check the general demands here : https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/7cfgc7/kr_unpack_protest_freebloo/


- 30 days of free buffs : This wasn't us, it's a desperate attempt to calm down Koreans anger, which caused Pearl Abyss's stock market to decrease -3.43% https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/263750:KS now at -2.67%.


Gaming, is a huge industry on KR, an official sport with respect, it isn't viewed as a childish entertainment, which is why it population is far advanced when it comes to dealing with gaming companies, properly and efficiently.


If i were in charge of the game, as a company, i would 100% disregard customers who's only way of protest is crying : 

 **There is no financial loss for me, in fact if i went ahead to listen and apply their demands, i would have to move resources, which isn't guaranteeing any positive return on the investment = **Crying, isn't only passive but is guaranteed to produce no result.**

But hey, that's one of the best parts of working night audit, with nobody in the office you don't have to hold it in. Somehow I hadn't seen a single guest the entire night, and I got a little lost in my own world just trying to stay awake. Ear bud in one ear listening to music, dancing a little while cleaning the lobby to stay moving.  

About 3 in the morning I go to deliver receipts and as I get to the very end of the very top floor and am turning around to walk back to the elevator, my stomach rumbles ominously.  

Fuck it, everyone is asleep, I'll just let it all out. So I just start walking towards the elevator, all the while doing my best impression of a horse walking over pavement. Get to the elevator, hit the button, turn around to wait...  

...and meet the appalled gaze of an old lady. Ah fuck. I halfheartedly greet her with a ""good morning"". She does not reply. We both get in the elevator. The elevator slowly, slowly descends to ground level while we both pointedly pretend the other does not exist. We walk side by side down the long hallway to the front desk, she exits the building, and I tell her to have a wonderful day. And then go hide in the back office and try my best not to die of embarrassment. So that was my mortifying morning, how was your weekend?"

Hey guys, here I am again to make a list of all units (fodders non-included and in general, all units that can't go up to 4 stars at least not included) that get the double buff from legend Katakuri, i.e the units you'll want to use most of the time with him. I decided to make this list because I saw a lot of people calling him ""restrictive"" and what not, but I don't entirely agree with this, so without further ado, here is the list (this time the display will be a bit different : I'll put the origin of the unit as the main category AND THEN the double classes as the sub category)

Last thing : Kindly note that we don't know yet (I think) Katakuri's classes nor his batch (if he gets one) so discussing team building might be complicated for now.

Feel free to tell me if there are mistakes or if I forgot some units !

Also, of course, feel free to discuss about Katakuri's potential subs in the comments.

edit 1 : my hands hurt.

Imo : I see lots of great potential units that may, or may not be useful to him, depending on his classes : the Boa Sisters, the Germa 66 units, Legend Robin and Magellan, some very useful colosseums like Nekomamushi or Kyros, I think he has some great potential. The thing that bothers me the most is that there doesn't seem to be any ""Rainbow"" atk booster (aside from RR Tsuru, but maybe I missed an important one) so making a team with all 5 classes might be complicated, but hey again we'll see. Edit : yeah, I missed Raid Tankman, but in order to get the full boost Katakuri will have to be psy so... one out of 5 chance I guess, although the type we've seen last for legend units was PSY, tied with INT with the dual release of V2 Aokiji and Akainu, and before that the last legend was INT (Shanks V2) so i'd say there's a good chance of him being PSY actually."
I want to learn how to have a good trip. I want to learn how to have a psychedelic trip confidently. I want to make sure I am not going to have psychosis or become schizophrenic.,32,83,False,False,False,IWantToLearn,1527524602.0,True,"Edit: Thank you to everyone for sharing their insights and experiences thus far. These comments alone make me feel better about any potential psychedelic experience that I might have. I guess I should have clarified initially that I want to try DMT. Also, I tried a small amount of shrooms when I was younger but I can’t remember much about it and it’s been many years since then and life is just different now, I feel different now. Along with that, I honestly just fear going crazy because it seems to me like the only real rational fear next to death but maybe thats the ego talking... I think about these things when I’m sober regularly and when I smoke weed I’ve gotten very anxious from these thoughts so I figured I should get advice before delving into more powerful psychedelics. I really just hope to enjoy the experience and I hope to come out of it both happy and healthy. In addition, I hope that DMT or maybe a different psychedelic will change my perspective in a positive way and allow me to let go of my two fears rather than amplify them. I don’t want them to spiral me into a bad trip that really fucks me up. Again, thank you for your help and honesty friends. I guess Im just still afraid of the unknown and I will have to overcome that sober or face my fears/demons head on well Im tripping. It seems that the best thing I can do is make sure I am in a good spot as far as my life situation goes and then accept the fact that I am at the mercy of the chemical compounds and my own mind. It also seems that I must choose to have a positive perspective to have a positive experience, just like I must in life in general, this seems obvious but it is easier said then done."

Let Me In,8,117,False,False,False,shortscarystories,1527519008.0,True,"We just got a new apartment, We were moving the cats the day before, and I was nervous to leave them alone in an unfamiliar environment, feeling like we forgot about them. So I decided to stay the night before our move while my husband stayed back at our old place to meet the movers the next morning. 

I was fine until the sun went down. The unfamiliarity of a new place, the lack of furniture, the way the soft meows echoed through the empty apartment put me on edge. 

When I was just reassuring myself I was silly, there was a knock at the front door. I didn’t even get up; no way was I opening that door to a stranger while I was here by myself. 

The knock persisted. I got up and quietly shut the bedroom door and leaned up against it. The safety of being shut in the small space gave me a modicum of comfort. 

That’s when I heard the knocking again. This time I jumped as the vibrations through the door pumped against my shoulders. How did they get inside? My cats looked at me in alarm, sensing my fear. I looked around for a place to hide, but with no furniture it looked like my only option was the closet. I had my hand on the knob ready to open when I heard something soft. 

A knock, from inside the closet. "

Amateur Overwatch Coaching and Analysis Contest!,31,276,False,False,False,Competitiveoverwatch,1527520547.0,True,"Hi everyone!

I'm Jayne, an Overwatch streamer who primarily focuses on educational content, and **I'm running a contest in order to find the best amateur coach and analyst in Overwatch.** Do you think you know the game inside and out? Well, it's time to find out!

After having watched the game between the Philadelphia Fusion and the Dallas Fuel this past week, I was really fascinated by Dallas Fuel's defense on Hanamura A, and think there were a lot of interesting things that happened and are worth being discussed in more detail. Check it out:

Video Links:  
https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/match/10466/game/10019  
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/265968386  

**The Dallas Fuel's defense of Hanamura A is going to be the subject of the contest.**

If you consider yourself a coach, take a look at the Philadelphia Fusion's attack and create a sample analysis piece that you could present to the Philadelphia Fusion in order to explain why they were unable to capture Hanamura A, major errors from individual players, how the team could have adapted during the game, as well as any suggested compositions or plays that they could use to counter that strategy in the future.

If you consider yourself an analyst, take a look at the Dallas Fuel's defense and create a sample analysis piece that you could present to the Houston Outlaws (or any other team) in order to explain how the composition functions, how the Dallas Fuel was positioned and why, why the composition is strong on Hanamura A, and finally the overall strengths and weakness of the strategy.

Submission can either be in written or video form, and as simple or in-depth as you like - there are no restrictions. **Send your completed piece to jayneoverwatch@gmail.com by Friday at Noon EST.** Two finalists from each category will be invited to join me on Saturday's stream in order to discuss and debate their piece, with a single winner being awarded an OWL jersey of their choice."

"[MANGA SPOILERS] There is no ""Final Form""",6,147,False,False,False,TokyoGhoul,1527522979.0,True,"I've been keeping pace with Tokyo Ghoul since around Chapter 60 of the original manga, and from then and until now, I've seen a reoccurring theme: People being upset about Kaneki's constant evolution and how, despite those evolutions, he still deals with some of the same core issues in lategame :re that he's had since Chapter 1 of the original manga. People originally thought that Kaneki accepting his ghoul side during Jason's torture would be his most major development. Others accepted Haise as the new status quo and were fine with Kaneki being simply 'a past dream'. To be honest, fans seemingly became so tired of Kaneki 'developing' that they clung to Black Reaper, One Eyed King, and Dragon as being the end of his chain.

I think that the flaw in this thinking is that a character's development ever really ends.

Throughout western and eastern culture, from some of our earliest works to many of our latest, humans have written stories where a protagonist struggles and overcomes the problems presented before them in life. This usually results in a protagonist that has changed somewhat for the better or whose circumstances have changed somewhat for the better. However, these protagonists only seem complete because the stories themselves are complete. When the story ends and you put down the story, you don't get to see the rest of that character's life (if they're still alive). You can daydream about it, but most people are content with the protagonist's struggle, and thus meaning, being complete and over.

Ishida, I perceive, is using this expectation of completion against us. He made many believe that Shironeki was a cool badass who would definitely become a powerful kakuja that could protect his friends, but then subverts it by having Shironeki thwarted by that very power until it places him before an undefeatable Arima. Then, he had us think that Haise would remain because, as Haise, Kaneki was actually happy and optimistic about the future... until Eto ruined that for the sake of her own grand scheme. The Black Haired Reaper, The One Eyed King, and Dragon were all thought to be the end of Kaneki as we knew him. ""This guy will definitely defeat Arima Kishou."" ""A King can't lose to a Joker!"" ""A monster like Dragon will destroy Tokyo, and the whole world with it.""

The majority of fans were wrong because they unconsciously expected Kaneki's development to end somewhere, like a traditional protagonist. However, Ishida's goal with this tragic protagonist doesn't seem to be getting him to a point where we can say 'This is the result of Kaneki's struggle, this is it'. I believe that Tokyo Ghoul:re will end with Kaneki having overcome many of his core issues (valuing power over morality, choosing to handle everything alone, etc) but still maintaining enough of his personality quirks and problems that he is not indistinguishable from the original Kaneki. He'll still a work-in-progress at the end of the series and, in my opinion, that would be better for this sort of story than a complete character.

Why?

Because a character is only truly complete if they die, and Kaneki has more to do in this world after Furuta, Dragon Rize, and the remnants of V/The Clowns have been dealt with. He still has to atone for what he did as Dragon. He still has to guide the ghouls who followed him and believed his promise of a world where they would be accepted. He still has to see his child be born and pass on to them what he didn't get as a child.

Some people think that the true tragedy will result in Kaneki dying before he gets to do all of this, but I believe the true tragedy will lie in how utterly human Kaneki is: in how him being an average joe (in many, not all, respects) thrown into a supernatural world fucked him over, and in how he's meant to continue evolving and changing even after the last panel of :re is printed. He'll continue to struggle, but his struggle will no longer be relevant to the larger themes and moral lessons, so they'll be left to our offscreen imaginations. That's how it should be. The mark of a good character is when you wonder about their future long after the story they originate from is over.

tl;dr Kaneki's various personalities may never coalesce into one mentality and Kaneki's development may never end in a solid place, but wherever it ends up, I believe that it will be meaningful."

***
As the horse plunged down the snowy road, Clint began realizing that he hadn’t thought this through quite all the way. He was hurtling through the darkness on a huge animal, into who-knew-how-deep snow, towards a forest almost certainly full of guns and people ready to use them… all to help some stranger bleeding in the snow.

He reasoned to himself that Atlas wouldn’t let them shoot at just anybody. Not after they went so long leaving their presence unannounced. 

The figure was heaving themselves across the snow on hands and knees, head ducked low, occasionally stealing glances of utter disbelief at him. When Clint got closer, he could see the person was a man, shuddering with cold, hands bound in what looked like bundled up T-shirts. Clint didn’t have to ask if he was an NPC; no one in Atyn wore blue jeans. 

The man clutched an arm around his middle, and it ran as red as the snow around him. 

Another bullet screamed out of the darkness. Clint ducked on impulse and threw himself off the horse before he could let it frighten him into freezing. The horse stamped urgently, looked like it wanted to bolt. Clint snatched the reins and shushed it with vague reassurance. He reached with his other hand to haul the man upright, the sheer terror of death—real death—driving him forward like a mad man. 

“What—” the man started, but Clint snapped, “Shut up,” and threw him over the horse’s whithers. The stranger clutched the horse’s mane and swayed like a drunk. Clint heaved himself up onto its back behind him, took the reins, 

“Hold on,” Clint hissed through his teeth. A bullet sailed by and clipped the horse’s ear. A little burst of blood exploded outward.

The horse screamed and took off so quickly Clint had to clench both his thighs tightly to stay on. He threw his free arm around the other man and pressed both their bodies down close to the horse’s neck. There was no guiding the damn thing now. He could only cling on and pray it ran back the way it came, hope that it slowed before it managed to buck them off completely. 

The man shrieked back at him, “What the fuck? Why did you do that?”

“Shut up,” Clint repeated, more urgently this time. “You’ll scare the horse.”

“I think bullets scare the fucking horse!” 

Clint did not bother arguing. The horse careened across the open field between the houses and the wood. Another bullet chased after them, but it did not find its mark, and the trees went silent once more. Despite his best hopes, the horse didn’t seem to know where the hell it was going. It ran pell-mell behind the houses, bursting through snowdrifts and dead gardens until it at last reached the road, and then it kept going. Clint yanked backwards on the bridle, but nothing would convince it. The horse was massive, senseless, and terrified, and Clint caught himself eying the snow below them, wondering if it would be enough of a cushion. If his head could take another smack, if he didn’t land right. 

The horse didn’t give him time to decide. It suddenly locked its front legs and jammed its hooves into the ground, sending both men pitching over its head before Clint even quite realized what was happening. For a moment, he thought he was having another concussive spell, but then he realized he really *was* moving, the ground was indeed orbiting out and out until it disappeared out from under him completely.

He hit the ground hard on his side. The man landed next to him, groaning.

For a long half second, Clint lay dazed, gazing up with half-open lids, not quite grasping what he was seeing. There, against the velvet wall of night, the horse rising up, its hooves reaching up as if to touch the stars—

Clint grabbed the man’s arm and shoulder and rolled them both out of the way just as the terrified horse slammed its front hooves back into the ground before it took off running once more. They lay there side by side in the reddening snow, panting, temples still touched together in disbelief. Then Clint hauled himself upright, glanced around, and said, “Well, fucking shit.”

The man in the did not try to rise. He unzipped his jacket, a ratty windbreaker, and lifted up both of his sweaters to show a pale belly, a gaping circle of torn flesh just about his hip. His breath caught in his throat, went ragged, like he was trying not to cry.

“It’s okay, man. I got shot before. You’ll be okay.”

He shook his head. Pressed his face into his hands, smearing his forehead and cheeks with his own blood. He didn’t answer.

Clint pushed himself to his feet and gazed around with a sigh. He had no idea where the horse had carried them. He knew the way the horse had bolted was the same way they left town for the Lonely Mountain, but the trees had been such a blur, and he’d been so intent merely on keeping himself and the wounded stranger upright that he did not think to pause and look around.

But there was no time to curse that. The forest rose up all around them. Wherever they were, it would take Atlas’s men a hell of long walk to reach them. They had a narrow head start and badly needed to take advantage of it.

He offered his hand to the man and said, “I’m Clint.”

“Boots.” 

“What?”

“Call me Boots.” Almost begrudgingly, he accepted Clint’s outstretched hand and sat upright with a gasp. 

Clint snorted and said, “Uh, okay.” He cocked his head at the man’s accent as he scoured the night for any hint of man or animal, lurking out there in the wood. Boots’s words had an expansive, upward lilt, as if every vowel were a plateau to rise to and pause to appreciate. “Were you Russian or something?” 

“Vainakh,” He spat red into the snow. Clint didn’t know if that was a curse or a correction. He didn’t ask. Instead, he just started to unbuckled his cloak.

Boots waved him away. “I’m fine with cold,” he insisted, his voice wandering and strange. *I’m fine vis cold*.  “I’m not even *that* cold.”

“I think that not feeling cold is the first sign of being too fuckin’ cold, dude.”

“No, I have a way of keeping my temperature up.” He hunched up his shoulders to his ears and explained, “I tighten my muscles and focus on flowing all my blood to there.”

“Don’t do that. Seriously.” Clint wrapped his cloak around Boots’s shoulders. “The game makes you heal faster, not turn into superman.” He nearly added *so don’t be so actively fucking stupid*, but then he realized that he sounded too much like Malina. 

Boots wilted and scowled. He did not wrap the cloak tightly around himself, but he didn’t shrug it off, either. 

“Why the hell did he shoot you?”

That made Boots grimace, showing his canines. He pressed one of his T-shirt-bundled hands against his gaping belly. “Atlas tell us he ran into Death on the road, yeah? Says only ten can win next level. And there are sixteen of us. So he draws circle in the snow—” Boots traced a circle on the snow beside him; blood chased the edge of it “—and throws two knives in the middle. He says we will fight, and bottom six will be left here to die.” He raised a bleak stare to the trees. His sigh clouded the air. “I refuse to fight.” 

Clint swallowed around the lump in his throat. He sank down, hunkering on his heels in the snow. “Why?”

“I don’t kill my friends,” Boots answered, as if this should be obvious. He nodded down the road, back the way they’d come. “So Atlas have us losers sit there on the ground. He says he will let us go, but I know him. He does not let people go.” He frowned down at his own belly. “So I run. He shoots me. And you show up, like a big idiot on a big horse.” But now the man was grinning, his teeth blood-slicked, his smile strained; Clint knew the pain well enough himself.

“Yeah, well. You’re welcome.”

Boots’s smile vanished. He snapped his head to the side and hissed, “Someone is coming.”

Clint muttered curses under his breath when he reached back for his rifle and found nothing. “Do you have—” he started.

Boots shook his head. “They take everything useful.”

Clint gripped his hair with both hands and swore. He could help drag Boots off the road, but anyone could follow the trail of blood and upturned snow. And he did not want to think about what kind of blood-mad creatures waited in the woods. He could hear it too now, the stamp of hooves, a man barking out a sharp order before he went quiet again.

Boots hauled himself unsteadily to his feet and stood there for a moment, wobbling. Clint put an arm around his shoulders, and the man sank into his embrace with a faintly embarrassed sigh.

“We need to hide,” Boots started, but before Clint could argue back, a small group of people and horses crested the hill.

Almost instantly, Clint recognized the two riders at the head of the procession. Erwulf and his advisor Eram, both their faces dark with displeasure. A little boy leaned around from behind Eram, where he apparently sat clinging to the man’s back. He pointed ahead and said, “That’s him! He stole the horse. He said he couldn’t talk and he *can*.”

“Ah, shit,” Clint sighed. He put his free hand up to show he wasn’t armed and waited, damning his luck and the timing of it all. 

The viceroy stopped his horse just a few feet from Clint and Boots and he scowled down the bridge of his nose at them. “You,” he said to Clint, “have made the mistake of abusing my trust.” He nodded to Eram and said, “Tie them up and take them back.”

“He’s hurt,” Clint tried explaining, lamely, but Eram slipped off his horse and told him, “Be quiet.”

So Clint did. He stood there obedient and fuming as Eram tied his wrists in front of him and secured it with a rope to the back of his horse’s saddle. A part of Clint wanted to laugh when he saw that their third horse was Daphne’s lost one; perhaps they had found it wandering the woods. Eram helped Boots up onto it, cursed him for getting blood on his tunic, and tied Boots’s wrists to the saddle horn. 

And then at Erwulf’s command, they began the long journey back to the viceroy’s home.

P.S. some of you may have recently become aware of reddit's updated [user agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement), specifically clause 4. Some writers have found this reason enough to move their work off of reddit. I totally respect the concern motivating that choice. However I personally do not mind giving reddit the permissions outlined in the user agreement, mostly because I believe they are necessary concessions for reddit to function as it does. I do not believe there is any realistic concern that reddit will attempt to reproduce or republish my work (beyond, you know, letting it show up on any variety of third party Reddit apps, which is a kind of republishing, hence the need for that clause), nor do I mind the unedited version of this draft existing on reddit's servers in perpetuity... because that was my plan in the first place, lol. Since I don't take the updated clause as a significant threat to my intellectual property rights, I'm just going to keep being here, mostly for ease of access and consistency. Also so I don't have to migrate over 60 fuckin' chapters, lol.

Anywho, thanks for reading &lt;3

""So including the ambush team, this is how many rangers accounted for?""

*Accounted for meaning dead, in this particular situation.*

""Eight,"" Moss replied.

*Just eight men, to do all this.*

I'd come down from the tower once I'd been assured that it was safe, I'm sure I'd had a good reason, some nonsense about the Minutemen seeing their liege walk among them improving morale, but now that I was face to face with the carnage I realised how pointless it was.

The dead and wounded had been taken away, but it didn't take a pile of corpses to bring the mood down. Just about every window in the hall was broken, either by stray bullets or the concussion of a grenade, forming little sparkling piles below each of the empty window frames. The dining tables, overturned to form makeshift cover, was missing chunks from edges and corners, or in some cases were blasted right to splinters.

A few of them, much fewer than I would have thought to judge from the carnage, were riddled with the small bullet impacts that were the trademark of the Rangers’ weapons, which fired smaller projectiles at a much higher velocity.

I kicked at some of the hundreds of shell casings scattered across the floor, sending them clattering down the smooth stone floor. Several came to an abrupt halt in a pool of drying blood, and I grimaced, wondering if whoever left all that behind had made it. The shell casings too were mostly the sort that belonged to the Minutemen. In fact, I really had to look to find *any* shell casings from the Ranger's weapons.

""They can't have had much ammunition,"" I muttered, half to Moss, half to myself, ""Have any of these been taken?"" I asked, picking up a discarded magazine.

I'd spotted a couple lying empty on the ground, and was beginning to find more shell casings in .280 NATO as I made my way down the dining hall.

""No,"" Moss replied, ""There were a few left on the bodies though, a few of them were still loaded with cartridges. We've got them in a pile with the other gear we've recovered.""

""Alright,"" I sighed, once I'd completed my walk of the hall, ""Show me what we've got.""

Moss nodded, ""Come on, we're keeping it all in the kitchen.""

I followed Moss from the dining hall, careful not to slip on the brass or track yet more blood across the floor.

---

*Ah shit.*

""Moss,"" I grimaced, ""There are nine rifles here. I mean, they're all trashed, but I can't help but notice that there are nine of them.""

""I have the Minutemen looking for the missing Ranger,"" Moss promised, ""At least the ones that are still on their feet.""

I took up one of the rifles, the only one with a scope, and turned it over in my hands. Like the two we'd found in the hands of the original ambush team, each one of the rifles was ruined.

*And in precisely the same way, too. I kinda feel like someone's fucking with me here.*

The receiver, on every single one, had been blown out, as if the weapon had been too weak to contain the forces exerted upon it when firing. Could a misloaded cartridge ruin a firearm? Oh, certainly. I'd seen it happen when I'd toured one of my proofing houses. But it wouldn't do something like this, and certainly not to a modern rifle.

*And definitely not nine times in a row.*

My rifles were brass and wood and didn't look half this bad when they failed to proof. These were polymer and steel but still looked like a grenade had gone off inside. Even the scope on this one was ruined, torn half off its mounts with all the lenses shattered. They'd been sabotaged, and not subtly.

""That particular one was found by the windows at the back of the hall,"" Moss explained, ""The rest were found at least somewhat close to the body of one Ranger or another. If I had to guess I'd say that whoever that belonged to was providing suppressing fire down the hall.""

""And when they saw the last of their buddies go down, they bolted,"" I agreed, ""The rifle exploding in their hands probably didn't help. Is anything else unaccounted for?""

""We've only got eight pistols, and he might have a grenade or two since we can't really say if those are missing or used,"" Moss shrugged, ""So he's not entirely unarmed.""

""Were any of the pistols sabotaged?"" I asked, trading the ruined rifle for one of the handguns.

""I couldn't say,"" Moss replied, ""They look fine, but how would I know? They're nothing like the pistols you made for us.""

Upon closer inspection, it didn't look very sabotaged. Bren Ten was inscribed across the side and ejecting the magazine told me that it was indeed chambered in 10mm Auto, but other than those interesting bits of trivia, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

I checked and cleared the rest of the pistols, examining the magazine springs and firing pin before moving onto the next.

Nothus probably would have called me on my bullshit if she'd been here, insisting that I was just trying to distract myself. And she'd be right, it was one thing to think objectively about the consequences when it was all happening at a mile's distance, it was another when you could smell the blood and gunpowder.

I wasn't completely wasting my time though, as I discovered when I racked the slide on one of the pistols. I'd expected a live cartridge to pop out, as had been the case with the rest of the pistols I'd checked. Instead, I got empty brass.

*Failure to eject. That might have made the difference for one of my Minutemen, at least, I hope it did.*

There was a knock at the door, and then a Minuteman, injured but still standing, stepped through.

""Sir, we've got him.""

---

The Minuteman, number fifty-six, lead Moss and I to a small barracks in the north of the city. The Minutemen had run down the Ranger near there, and rather than try to manhandle him all the way back to city hall, had stashed him there.

It was smart, especially since I still couldn't shake the feeling that someone was fucking with me.

It was a squat stone building set with narrow windows that were little better than arrow slits, and I saw two Minutemen standing watch on a balcony that ringed the lightly sloped roof of the building.

The Minutemen had evidently restrained themselves enough to keep the Ranger alive, but that didn't mean that they were gentle. I hadn't yet crossed the street, and already I could hear an indistinct shouting, muffled by the thick wood door.

A sharp knock from Moss and a small slat was pulled across, and a pair of huge blue eyes peered through at us.

""Password?"" I half expected to hear the man say, but he only gave us a once-over before closing the slat.

The door opened a moment later, and for the first time, I heard one of the Rangers speak.

""Private Paulson, United States Army, service number fifty-four, seven nine eight, two one two,"" the Ranger grated.

He was seated in the centre of the room, facing away from the door, but despite that, I could tell that he was in pretty rough shape. His being tied to the chair probably didn't help, and it seemed as if the Minutemen were indulging in the Jack Bauer method of interrogation.

""That's not what I asked,"" snapped one of the Minutemen, ""Hit him again.""

""*Whoa, whoa, whoa,*"" I called, ""Let's all relax a little.""

""Guildmaster! Ah, we were-""

""Just leaving,"" I nodded.

""Leaving?"" he asked.

""Go stand guard outside,"" I insisted, ""Minuteman Zero and I will handle this.""

The Minuteman nodded sharply, and with a wave he lead the rest of the Minutemen out onto the street, leaving Moss and myself there alone with the man.

It certainly seemed like the sort of place that Jack Bauer would use to interrogate someone, though the theme was more medieval than industrial. Poor lighting, a low ceiling, and a damp and musty smell.

*I'll add that to the list of things to do if I ever manage to hold onto the city. Provide my military with better facilities than this hellhole.*

I stepped around in front of the Ranger and sat down on a low wooden table. The creaking groan it made as I did wasn't exactly encouraging, but it didn't collapse, and I didn't trust any of these mattresses.

""Private Paulson,"" he began again, ""United States Army, service number-""

""You said that already,"" I noted, as Moss stepped up behind the man, ""And  I don't really care. What I do care about, is Nothus, where is she?""

""Private Paulson, United-""

""You know they've got an American hostage, right?"" I interrupted, ""Sulia's threatening to take her as a concubine. I don't suppose I need to spell out what that means?""

Now that brought him up short.

""You're bullshitting me.""

""Her name's Brandy, she's tall, blonde, from Florida. Or California, I always get those two confused. Either way, tall blonde valley girl, one of only two humans fighting on the side of Azarburg. Surely you must have done some recon, you can't have just taken my Uncle's word at face value. You must have noticed, or at least heard, that Brandy hasn't been around.""

""Doesn't mean you're not bullshitting me,"" he insisted, though his demeanour was thoughtful now, rather than defiant.

""Well you haven't got a whole lot of choice,"" I told him, ""You can tell me your name rank and serial number all you like, but the Geneva conventions don't have multi-dimensional jurisdiction. Maybe you would have been fine if I'd captured you a day or two ago, but now, after what I've seen today, I'm in a bad fucking mood. So, simple question, where is Nothus?""

He didn't say a word, his mouth set in a thin line.

""Really?"" I asked incredulously, ""You're really going to fight me on this? For what exactly? You're not a fan of me, that much is obvious, but I doubt that you see Sulia or my Uncle as some shining beacon of American democracy. No, for you they're the lesser of two evils, and you're not a fool Private Paulson, you can't be,"" I insisted, lazily drumming my fingers on the table beside me, ""You know that something's off, each of you had just enough time to run through the majority of your ammo before your rifles failed catastrophically. One would be *really* strange, those rifles are built better than that, but *all* of them? No, you know something's up.""

""Easy then, you magiked them to blow up,"" he shrugged.

""Really, and break the treaty? No, if I were going to break it, I'd do a hell of a lot more than ruin a couple rifles, and I'd certainly do it before you had a chance to get all those shots down range. Trust me, I checked, you each had four magazines. One in the rifle, and three on your person. On every man, we found three empty mags, and one nearly so. I bet if I checked your gear,"" I pointed to the piled gear on another table, ""I'd find the same thing.""

""So Sulia betrayed us? That's it then?"" Paulson asked with a sneer.

""Why not? You guys brought a hell of a lot of firepower to bear, but you only had so much ammunition. You each had four mags, one rocket tube, and maybe a couple of grenades, mortar shells and a single claymore. It made you nearly unstoppable as long as you had ammunition, but as soon as it was used up, you were just a bunch of Outsiders with questionable loyalty and dangerous ideas.""

""You're saying we're expendable,"" Paulson grimaced.

I spread my hands, ""Where's Nothus?""

""I don't know,"" Paulson said after a moment, ""I was with the mortar team at first, we didn't join up with the breach team until after they'd run into her.""

""Did they kill her?"" I asked softly.

""They said that they did,"" Paulson breathed.

Moss began to edge away from Paulson, boots scraping on the rough floorboards, the man himself seemed frozen to his chair.

*I can always kill him later.*

I let out a breath, and continued, ""Why did you go through the hall? Why the hell didn't you just kick in the front door?""

Reprieve granted, Paulson settled a little in his chair, and continued, ""We were told that while there were only one or two Minutemen still at city hall, and maybe a couple of regular guards, you'd booby-trapped the front courtyard. Our contact told us to go in through the windows by the dining hall. We figured we'd slip in, and that by the time anyone realised we were in the building we'd be halfway to you already.""

I forced myself to stay calm, and not to get too excited. Paulson could still be screwing with me, one last attempt to get me to turn on an ally, but what he was telling me *felt* true at least.

""And just who is your contact?""

Paulson shook his head, ""We never got his name, but from what we overheard from Sulia and your Uncle, it was one of the Patricians.""

*Well shit.*

""One of?"" Moss asked, ""That's not very helpful, it's going to be your word against his, and you don't even know which one you're supposed to be accusing.""

""Did you hear his voice?"" I asked.

""Yeah,"" Paulson nodded, ""But only over the radio, and the reception was pretty shit. Pretty sure he was using one of your sets.""

""So what now Guildmaster?"" Moss asked, ""And what do we do with this one?""

""We can make this work,"" I sighed, ""Probably. Bring him, we'll need him for what I have in mind.""

I shoved at the door, looking for something to take out my frustrations on, and found the war room empty, save for a few of Natho's stewards who'd been left to keep an eye on things. The balcony doors had been left open, allowing the musty smell of rain to roll into the room, the hush of raindrops against the clay roof of the building serving to make the mostly deserted room seem even lonelier.

I stepped out onto the balcony and held out a hand, the rain was still light, but judging from the sky above it was likely to get worse in short order.

I leaned down to cross my arms on the balcony railing and noticed a few drops of blood on the sleeve of my robes. I'd made a mess of myself, helping the others tend to the injured Minutemen. Evidently, I'd missed a little when I was trying to get myself cleaned up.

Quinn tried to tell me, all those months ago, what war with human weapons would look like. I even thought that I'd understood what he meant, but these last few hours had been proof that I hadn't.

From my vantage point at city hall, I could see that the disposition of forces on the battlefield was a little better, but there were still problems.

Between the rain, the continued bombardment from the rifled cannon, and the approaching darkness, Sulia's crossbowmen had been forced back into the foothills south of the city. That had forced the retreat of Sulia's sword and spearmen as well, at least those that hadn't made it into the city or been shot making the attempt.

The problem was the portion of the army that *had* made it into the city. Our own forces held them contained, despite being outnumbered nearly two to one, but how long could that last? Especially once the sun had passed below the horizon, it would be a great deal easier for a few men to slip through our lines. And once a few had made it through they'd be able to wreak havoc, allowing yet more men through.

I heard the click of a latch behind me, the creak of a door swinging open, and then a brusque demand from Patrician Ucaid, ""Where's Quinn?""

""I don't know,"" I called back tiredly.

It was a lie, I did know, he was chasing down the last Ranger, but I was too tired to explain. Someone else could do it, or Quinn would tell Ucaid himself.

""Dammit,"" Ucaid swore, though he'd already turned back into the room.

I pushed myself away from the railing and steeled myself, I couldn't show weakness, especially not in front of one of the Patricians.

I stepped in out of the rain and whispered a spell to dry my clothes.

""This is not good Prime Minister,"" Ucaid insisted, his assistant at his side, gesturing at the maps laid out on the table.

He was right, Quinn's little figurines didn't exactly paint a pleasant picture.

""So much I have noticed.""

""Have you noticed this?"" he asked, waving a hand at the cluster of red figures piled at the southern gate, ""They hold everything south of this avenue here, and we're only just holding them. We're lucky the street is wide enough, Sulia's men would be making it across if it were half a foot narrower.""

""But they're not, and with every attempt, more of them fall, and we expend only ammunition,"" I insisted, ""If we can keep them at bay through the night, then we may just force Sulia to capitulate.""

""His men are *in* the city,"" Ucaid snapped, ""As long as that's true he will not back down. We should send an envoy, see what concessions we can get while we still hold most of the city.""

""Out of the question, Quinn is not about to surrender.""

""Where is he then?"" he demanded, ""He should be here.""

""Perhaps, my lord,"" the assistant began, ""I might try to find him?""

As it happened, there was no need. The door to the hall clicked open, and Quinn strode through with a smug smile, one of the Rangers at his side.

""Patrician Ucaid!"" Quinn smiled, in what could only be an accusation.

I had just enough time to wonder what was going on when Ucaid and his assistant, frozen for a brief moment as Quinn had entered, sprang into action.

The Patrician tore something long and grey from his pocket- a pistol -but in his haste, he pulled the trigger while it was still pointed more or less at the ground. It seemed to startle him, and before he could bring his weapon in line to fire again, the Ranger had hit the floor.

For an instant I thought that he might have been shot, but then Moss stepped into the room, still in the guise of Minuteman Zero, weapon levelled, and shot Patrician Ucaid through the heart.

The assistant was not dispatched so quickly. With a shouted word a jet of fire had sprung into his hand, and he swept his arm across.

Quinn threw himself at Moss just as the other finished firing, and bore him to the ground.

*Dammit Quinn, you've really got to learn your blocking magic.*

The assistant, or rather, the Mage, leapt onto the table to get a better angle on Quinn, sending the little wooden figures clattering across the table and onto the floor.

The jet of flame tore across the maps- *Kennocha isn't going to be pleased, those aren't cheap* -the table, and snapped up to my face.

I was more than ready, and the flames crashed uselessly across my shield. The mage called out just as I did, each of us racing to cast another spell, but he finished an instant before I did, and the bolt of lightning cast at him fizzled uselessly against his own energy shield.

Energy shields, as it happens, are not so good at blocking physical spells, or even physical objects in general. So a moment after the flash of light from my bolt left us both half blind, Ucaid's pet mage was cut down in the hail of gunfire that followed.

Quinn and Moss both stood, coming into view above the level of the table, each with a revolver in hand, barrels smoking.

""Told you that would work,"" Quinn said, nodding towards the body.

Moss only sighed.

""How did you know? *When* did you know?"" I demanded.

""I figured out who it was right about the time that Ucaid tried to blow my head off,"" Quinn explained.

""Hold on, so-"" I began, only to be interrupted as Patrician Natho and most of his retinue pushed into the room.

I waved a hand, at first to clear the smoke that had begun to fill the room, and then again with a word to smother the fires before they grew out of control.

""So it was,"" Natho started, ""Oh-"" he said, coming up short when he saw the bodies of Patrician Ucaid and his assistant.

""I pulled the same trick with the others,"" Quinn explained, ""They just looked confused. Ucaid was the only one who snapped,"" Quinn shrugged, ""He probably would have gotten away with it too, if he'd just kept his cool, it's not like I had any proof.""

""The Ranger- him?"" I asked, pointing at the man who was only now hauling himself to his feet.

""I never knew which one it was,"" he explained, giving the assistant's body a kick, ""But I tell you what, I bet this is the asshole who sabotaged our gear.""

""Him, or some other Mage that Ucaid had on his payroll,"" Quinn shrugged, ""There you are, vengeance. You're welcome.""

The Ranger raised an eye at Quinn's glib tone, ""What happens now?""

""You mean to you?"" Quinn asked, ""You sit quietly in some cell while we push the rest of Sulia's men out of the city.""

""And then?""

""You play envoy, after that, I honestly don't care. Minuteman Zero?"" Quinn asked with a nod towards the human.

""Got it,"" Moss agreed, before taking the human by the arm to lead him from the room.

""You have a plan then?"" Patrician Natho asked.

""Yes,"" Quinn agreed, shuffling through the charred remains of the maps before finally settling on one, ""I understand we're holding them here?"" he asked, pointing out the road that Ucaid and I had just been discussing.

""That's correct,"" I agreed, ""The avenue is fairly wide, and runs in a sort of semicircle. It's keeping Sulia's men contained near the gate, and it's wide enough that they're having a great deal of trouble making it across without being shot by your riflemen. We're going to need to get that street lit if we're going to keep holding it through the night.""

""No,"" Quinn said simply, ""I'm done playing games. I've been trying half measures this whole time, trying to spare both Sulia's men and my own. All that's done is get my own people killed while we lose more ground than we should have.""

""So, um, what is the plan then, exactly?"" Patrician Natho asked.

""We torch the city. Everything south of the avenue burns. We've got incendiary shells for the mortars, and the Minutemen have their flares. We burn out Sulia's forces. They can burn to death or flee.""

""The rain though,"" Patrician Natho began.

""Won't matter,"" I said softly, once I'd realised just what Quinn had been thinking, ""In fact, it will probably help. A little rain won't stop a house fire, but it will stop stray sparks from landing elsewhere in the city to start fires.""

""And the avenue is wide enough that it won't spread from house to house. Everything south of that though is packed tight. It'll burn, and then we can see how Sulia feels about continuing this mess.""

I  think they do that because wine is perceived as fancy and elegant, as well as something you can learn something about.

I wonder if there would be as many posts like that or as many upvotes if ""beer"", hard liquor, or ""pot"" was substituted for the word ""wine"".

I wonder if it is a cover for alcoholism.

Which caused the person behind them to lock up their brakes, and the next person to lock up theirs, and then for me to lock up mine. As soon as I saw the brake lights, I braked, but it takes that extra second to realize they've locked up and for me to press harder to try to stop in time. Of course the person who did the cutting sees nothing wrong with this, and carries on their merry way to Northbound Deerfoot, while leaving a chain behind them which includes this pregnant woman, who had to go to the hospital for the next couple hours and be monitored to ensure my baby is still alive and that I didn't go into pre-term labour at 33 weeks. I still have to remain on the lookout for any bleeding or fluid leaking in case of placental abruption or water breaking, and make sure I don't have contractions.

Raptor Test Stand Progress,153,346,False,False,False,spacex,1527495855.0,True,"I noticed two satellite images of the Raptor test stand at SpaceX's McGregor test facility, which were posted by user Hitech at the [nasaspaceflight](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=41363.msg1823196#msg1823196) forum.


I went back to google maps to see if there was a more recent image. There wasn't, but I could get a higher zoom level. I made screenshots at max zoom and stitched them together.


The first is from 28/01/17 and the second from 23/01/18, so a year apart. I have also included a gif to better show the change:


[imgur.com/a/tlqwxEe](https://imgur.com/a/tlqwxEe)


Besides the significant expansion of the test stand and increased activity, you can clearly see that the western test cell is being fitted out. This confirms the [statement](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/spacex-propulsion-guru-tom-mueller-looks-ahead-rocket-engines-mars/) from Mueller:


“We’re building up the test stand right now. We’ve got the first flight version of that engine in work.”


Some users have wondered what ""flight version of that engine in work” means. Is it still being designed or is it being build? 

Given this evidence, I would say that it is being build so as to be ready simultaneously with the test stand for tests. Taking into account the activity at the stand (notice the number of cars parked) and the stated intention of making BFS hops next year, I would even conclude that it is likely that tests of the flight version will happen this year."

A great horror story can be shocking, disturbing, macabre and so on but they can also run the gamut from heartwarming to hilarious as long as it stays within the theme of horror.

I guess this rant makes more sense if I tell you guys that a friend tried arguing that Army of Darkness was simply a comedy and not a horror film today.  Not much upsets me but this still has me riled up hours later. "

Analyzing the lore in the Void Entity's dialogue. A prophecy?,20,71,False,False,False,RotMG,1527526568.0,True,"Realm has never been a lore central game, and it never had to be. But Lost Halls did it well, in my opinion, and the work to lore done with the Void Entity really opens eyes to a lot of the events that have been forgoing in the realm since the beginning. One particular series of lines the Void Entity states near the end of his fight in LH 2.0 really caught my attention. A prophecy being recited, perhaps?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Analyzing the Void Entity's Prophecy**

Near the end of the fight, when entering his last phase before death phase, the Void Entity repeats this series of lines in quick succession...

* A fallen king, an imprisoned queen, an effigy of gold.
* A glacial elder who knows more than you think, and a necromancer of old.
* An experiment that surpassed it's master, a ventriloquist's final show.
* And a white titan to conquer the Mad God...
* ALL UNDER MY CONTROL!

One can tell that this rhymes, as if a poem, prophecy, or just gimmicky sort of tale. These are all forces in the realm that the Void Entity has had an impact on, and one would notice their prominence. Some of these figures seem obvious, ""a fallen king"", and ""a glacial elder"" ring obvious bells to another Void Entity line stating ""The likes of Esben and the Forgotten King were expendable vessels, just as you shall be!""... but some others are a bit more obscure. Let's begin with the obvious.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A fallen king...**

The Forgotten King is an obvious target for the Void Entity. His kingdom, the sealed Shatters, is full of Pure Evil just as the Entity's arena is. It is somewhat suggested that lore-wise somehow the Void Entity put the Forgotten King up to challenging Oryx, but somehow failed. That, or the Void Entity contributed to the Shatters' downfall, as the Forgotten King (as suggested in Oryx shoutouts about the Avatar) historically also sought to control the realm and was just an opponent to the Void Entity against Oryx. There are two possible outcomes, based on this knowledge.

* The Void Entity attempted to manipulate the rather originally docile king into leading an army against Oryx to usurp control of the realm and use the king as a puppet.
* The Void Entity manipulated the Forgotten King into destroying his own kingdom through promises of it ending in Oryx's downfall, though in actually it was to remove the king from the picture so there would be no opponents to his eventual dominion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**An imprisoned queen...**

This one's a bit harder. While first signs would point to the Killer Bee Queen, we can know that's not the case because the line ""An experiment that surpassed it's master"" suits far better in accordance with information learned from the computer in The Nest, where Dr. Terrible used **Pure Evil**, the essence of the Void Entity, to mutate the queen into what it is. Besides, the queen doesn't seem so imprisoned if it surpassed its master. But do you know who is imprisoned? The Crystal Prisoner.

It is suggested that the Crystal Prisoner was another opponent of Oryx, in dialogue spoken by them. This would imply the Crystal Prisoner was in fact an old queen who defied his power and was sealed away in a magical crystal so as to never be heard from again. This could be another case of the Void Entity using other forces against Oryx to his advantage so that he could slowly whittle away at Oryx as one hundred different faces with different names. In the end, the Prisoner was another vessel lost. The question remains about just what the Prisoner was the queen of if this analysis is to be taken. But that I don't have an answer too and am just taking the line as is.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**An effigy of gold...**

There is only two golden effigies to really note of. The Golden Oryx Effigy in the Cave of a Thousand Treasures, and the Abyss Idol. Obvious signs would point to the former, as it is an effigy of Oryx. It is implied that the Void Entity needs some sort of actual physical body, be it man or golem, to directly attack and impact Oryx. Could an old Oryx effigy have been his first attempt that failed, causing Oryx to put it away in the Cave forever? It even flickers black and red for a bit when its circling idols are damaged, but that doesn’t seem to necessarily point to the purple and pink Void Entity color scheme. Its a bit up in the air, but just based on the line of the prophecy, the Effigy seems most likely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A glacial elder...**

This one is obviously Esben. Using the same line as used for the Forgotten King, and taking into account his appearance in the death animation, its almost certain. What purpose Esben served to the Entity however is unknown. Perhaps another mortal the Entity tried to use after the King and Prisoner fell, but was more resistant to his manipulative tactics, hence being... unwilling. It is implied by “who knows more than you think”, that control of Esben supplies some purpose. Perhaps the Void Entity wished to remain in secret, and Esben knew of his existence and threatened to warn the realm of his coming.

Either way, even after defeat and defeat, Esben returns, and the Void is never truly suppressed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A necromancer of old...**

Malus. The leader of the cult in the hideout beneath the halls. In the Records of the Lost Halls released with LH 1.0 in August, it was revealed that Malus was the leader of a clan of necromancers who attempted to utilize their magics to construct the perfect golem against Oryx. They would put the souls into the bodies of stone, and so that was the case. That suffices as lore for both the Golem enemy group and the use of necromancy in golem crafting suffices for explaining Malus' place in this. Even if the Void Entity did not directly control Malus, his life is now completely centered around keeping the Entity locked away in The Void no matter the cost.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**An experiment that surpassed its master...**

As stated before, the Killer Bee Queen fits the obvious role. She grew so powerful due to Dr. Terrible's use of Pure Evil in her mutation that she escaped and formed the impassable structure known as The Nest. This is all stated in the computer found in The Nest's treasure room after the fight with the Beekeeper. Since Pure Evil was used in her mutation, the Void assumed control.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A ventriloquist’s final show…**

This most likely refers to the Puppet Master, but specifically the battle in the Puppet Master’s Encore. Exactly how the Void Entity was manipulating the Puppet Master is unknown, but what is known is the PM’s relation to Oryx. When the Theatre was first released by Kabam, they released with it a passage relating it to the realm. The Puppet Master was a member of Oryx’s court, as every court needed a jester or someone to entertain them. The Puppet Master is then a very important figure in Oryx’s regime that it could be possible the Entity has tried to sway to his side numerous times. Maybe this line doesn’t exactly state he already has a grip upon the Puppet Master, but that he seeks to after claiming the realm from Oryx.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A white titan…**

The Marble Colossus, who in the lore, the Void Entity took control of to weaponize against Oryx. And to think every uncompleted Lost Halls resulted in the end of everything, as we opened its passages but not destroyed its secrets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what does any of this mean or matter? Well it really opens to eyes the history of the realm. If Oryx is not the one true god (he would have had to create the Void Entity if that were the case), that means it is possible he is UNFIT to rule the realm. That he only somehow managed to gain control of it by fluke. Oryx is far weaker in combat that many other entities that have tried to overthrow him in the past (at least prior to health scaling, but even now their fights remain more difficult). The Killer Bee Queen, the Forgotten King, the Marble Colossus. All those touched by the Void Entity become far stronger a force than even the tyrant god reigning over the realm now. It could be that Oryx is not meant to lead, as he is a brutishly aggressive and lazy drunk. If this is meant to be taken as a prophecy, it could be said that these people in them are the stars meant to align for the true ruler of the realm to usurp control of the realm. And if that is the case, only a few dont fall under his influence… So if the Void Entity gets his hands on the Puppet Master, then maybe the realm shall fall into the hands of its RIGHTFUL ruler, and into the arms of the Void. A being far beyond Oryx in strength, and far more tactful. Its implied in another line spoken by him that EONS of work had led up to the Void Entity’s plan to gain control of the realm from Oryx. He has waited millions of years for these stars to align so that he instead may rule. Over countless generations and the deaths of millions, the Void has manipulated and done all the small menial tasks that are just small cracks in a slab of stone waiting to fully fall to pieces. What does this mean for the future of the realm? Only DECA really knows.

Creepy Woman Tried to Take my Sister,33,794,False,False,False,LetsNotMeet,1527478979.0,True,"My mum was a single parent and as such she worked almost constantly and was nearly always tired as such she was not the most present parent. Despite being only 2 years older than my sister I was headstrong and insisted on acting as ""the man of the family"", putting on a tough face and powering through things (like comforting my sis when she had a nightmare so we didn't wake mum, etc).

This happened while we were on a shopping trip I'd say this I was about seven, making my sister, Alice, about 5. She was a talkative child, always requiring someone's attention and yet neither mum or I noticed that she had disappeared until we reached the checkout.

Thinking she had simply gotten distracted and wandered off mum wasn't too concerned and I volunteered to go get her. I walked past the aisles peeking my head down each to try and spot her dark, curly hair and pink jumper when I heard muffled crying and a woman trying to shush someone.

Rounding the corner to investigate I saw something chilling - a woman crouched down, desperately trying to quiet my crying sister with her hands vice-like on her wrist.

Seeing me the woman put on a smile and tried to shoo me away, ""Don't worry she just had a little fall.""

I vividly remember little 7 year old me straightening up, puffing my chest to look as tough as possible, with a glare I spat out ""that's my sister.""

Her smile dropped and she let go of Alice. I grabbed her and ran back to the front where mum was waiting outside. She didn't seem too concerned about the lady (she was probably exhausted tbh) despite the nail marks on my sister's arm and we just went home.

I'm 21 now so shopping child grabber, for your sake, let's not meet again."

This week we are showing you five different subreddits that are about stuff that happens not on purpose.

####/r/AccidentalRacism 

**92,196** people for **5 years!**

First of all, I want to acknowledge that racism is a serious subject. When in 2008 Barack Obama was elected president, many rejoiced at the notion of a post-racial era. But it seemed like the longer he served the more that racists came out of the dark cracks of society. Those cracks seem to have burst open after 2016. 

During this time we as a culture have become more sensitive to images of racism. 

/r/AccidentalRacism is a subreddit about when things appear to be racist, but are not. This can be interpreted as racist, though they did not intend to be racist. Unlike the subject of racism, this is a totally not serious subreddit. 

In order to get a feel for the sub, here are some examples of popular posts with explanations. 

&gt;# [This kid wearing an ""Alone in the Dark"" shirt.](https://i.redd.it/92zexof3vjl01.jpg)
&gt;&gt;Alone in the Dark is a video game series. The kid is obviously a fan. He's taking a pic with his friends. The joke is that he's the only white kid in the pic. The other three kids are black (dark skinned). 

&gt;#[This amusement park sign.](https://i.imgur.com/KP7A2zP.jpg)
&gt;&gt;""Yellow people"" is a derogatory term referencing the skin pigmentation of Asian peoples. 

&gt;#[This Hallmark sign.](https://i.redd.it/wo71lpvxxnz01.jpg)
&gt;&gt;Here's a really good example of marketers not thinking. There's a trend in marketing to be racially inclusive. Sometimes that accidentally backfires. The white mom is holding a baby of mixed race. The sign is promoting cards for single moms. The imagery and text conjure up the negative stereotype that black fathers are absent. 

&gt;#[This soccer match up.](https://i.redd.it/v3srjhm12rk01.jpg)
&gt;&gt;It's Nigeria vs. Germany, but the two countries abbreviations in that order spell a forbidden word. 

&gt;#[These children's clothes](https://i.imgur.com/9rbtv1u.jpg)
&gt;&gt;Here's one that's not accidental racist, but accidentally sexist. The subreddit is not just for accidental racism, but accidental any -ism. Here the pink shirt implies that girls grow up to be nurses, not doctors. 

&gt;#[This pizza place.](https://i.redd.it/no3u3axp26g01.jpg)
&gt;&gt;Here's an example of the intersection of crappy design and racism. One leads to the other by accident. The lowercase Zs in the Nizza sign look like Gs, which makes the word appear to be a no-no. 

 &gt;#[This oldie but goodie.](https://i.redd.it/0nu2bwteqpp01.png)
&gt;&gt;The episode description implies that Oprah is the ape. Calling black people monkeys or apes is a favorite pastime of shitbag racists. 

&gt;#[This ad for cheese.](https://i.redd.it/lvbpbh7s6zu01.jpg) 
&gt;&gt;The ad obviously means the kind of crackers you eat. It wants people who are buying crackers to also go buy cheese. But ""cracker"" is also a racial term for whites, and the picture of a white girl really drives that home. 

That's all for this showcase. Please remember that nothing is actually racist on /r/accidentalracism. Actual racism results in an immediate and permanent ban.

"Beyond the Monologue, Cutscenes and Plot Trails to make your Villains pop.",14,384,False,False,False,DnDBehindTheScreen,1527491788.0,True,"We're going to take a look at a few methods for allowing your villains to illustrate who they are and what their goals are without initiating a Monologue, by showing over telling and allowing more fluid storytelling.

Monologues are something near and dear to many of our hearts. Some people don't consider a BBEG legit unless he twirls his mustache, delivers a stunning monologue and then summons a pack of Gnolls for a stirring rendition of ""Be Prepared."" 

&amp;nbsp;

However some Tables are ready to scream ""Get Him!"" the second they get into the room, some people thing Monologues are tedious and self-indulgent and some people like me just blow at writing them. 

First off in order to leak their plans to the Party we can do this organically. If it's a High Powered Campaign it's the easiest thing in the world. If anyone's read Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive dead people randomly spout essential pieces of prophecy, which are collected and recorded by one of the key characters. If your Villain is an Eldritch God, Demon Lord or foretold Doom then people who die in related causes can drop pieces of prophecy as they die, or random people can have fits and speak prophecy to the Party. You can have this happen throughout the story or have players quest for this prophecy.

&amp;nbsp;


Second off, rather than giving people the plot through Monologue you can force your Characters to dig for the plot. Dark Souls fans may be familiar with having to dig and scrape for Plot rather than having it presented to them. Learning the Villain's intentions or Motivations can easily be a quest in itself.

We really want to amp up our villains, making them personable, accessible or scary. Instead of a Monologue we can do an in scene introduction where we introduce the Villain through organic roleplaying and their quirky behaviors.

&amp;nbsp;


DM:  Oliander Dax, the Sheriff of Slaughter strides into the Tavern five minutes late for your scheduled duel. 
PC: That Sonnnova, I start.
DM: He strides past you and begins ordering a Drink and a Meal. 
PC: I'm confused.
DM: Seeing your perplexed expression he explains. ""Slaughtering Peasants builds up an appetite. The Skewers I ordered take a minute to cook, so they should still be warm by the time I decorate the floor with your insides. I'm sorry if this is rude but butchering peasants builds up an unbelleivable appetite.""

Here we establish that Oliander is a Cocky Dick who is overly showing off how nonchalant he is about killing your ass. We can tell all kinds of stories in this scene. 

&amp;nbsp;

DM: Oliander Dax, the Sheriff of Slaughter strides into the Tavern five minutes late for your scheduled duel. 
PC: That Sonnnova, I start.
DM: He glances at you, then shuffles past and quickly orders then downs a Whiskey.
PC: I'm confused.
DM: Seeing your perplexed expression he explains. ""Well you remind me a little of my son, I like to imagine he'd have grown up to be someone like you, rather than someone like me. Well let's get this done.""

You can even go really Avant-Garde and just have the Villain roll into the Room and start trying to kill the Party cause he's got a meeting with Beelzebub at 6:00 and if he explained his complex plan to every pack of losers he wouldn't have to enact them.

Our Favorite Villains are the ones who when the Heroes show up are eating someone, or cooking a Souffle, or Pushing a dude out of an airlock, or judging a poetry contest with ruthless abandon.  Anyone who played Ocarina of Time will remember Ganondorf chilling out and playing the Organ. Bursting in on a lair characters should get a candid look at the Villain and be interested. You want them to care about the Villain and ask what's he doing or why. 

&amp;nbsp;

You can also throw down a Cutscene. These are briefer than a Monologue, but can still illustrate features of the enemies making them sympathetic or intimidating. 

The Scythe of Forever scuttles towards The Throne Room nervously, the tremendous creature wielding it's namesake Weapon moves cautiously, almost timidly into the atrium occupied by only yourself, Diedrich the Lance. With your party still trapped in the Gorgon pit only you can stop the creature. As the light from the blazing city refracts off the monster it extends five long shadows. Each one depicts a massive scythe wielding creature facing off against a Lone lance wielding Hero. In an instant five separate stories play out inside of your mind. In one the Hero takes a fatal blow in order to attempt one against the creature, in one the Heroes gallantry inspires the Heavens and they send an Angel down to fight beside him, in one through desperation he contracts his soul to Melkior the Glaberzu in exchange for incredible power, in one his party emerges from the pit early and aids him in his hour of need. In one the Hero transcends his own skills, mastering the way of Justice and claiming the power of his eternal birthrite. 

Each story ends with the Hero crushed to death by the creature. The Scythe smiles and enters the room.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a pretty low effort Cutscene, nothing really changes, no time passes and the plot doesn't advance but it does allow the DM to convey a simple concept or idea. Furthermore cutscenes like this put the ball in the players court.  When we snap back to real time Diedrich has the initiative and can choose how he approaches the situation. 

Bit of a rambling post, but the idea is that there are plenty of ways to build your Party's relationship with their villains. Monologues are still awesome, but they're just one of many tools in your box."

"Want to climb this Summer? Signups for Learning Fives, the premier team-based learning program, are now open!",20,49,False,False,False,summonerschool,1527531169.0,True,"**[[Click Here To Join Our Discord!]](http://www.discord.gg/learningfives)**
-----

###What is Learning Fives?

**Five players and one coach join together for five weeks of team based learning and practice.**  

During those five weeks, teams meet together at least twice a week for 2-3 hours and their coaches will spectate the games, working to create a well-oiled machine out of 5 chosen players. Our production staff will be hosting events each week including showmatches. Any team is free to participate in these events and it's a great chance to show off exactly what you've learned on the Rift.

###How do I signup?  

To sign up for Learning Fives, you must join our Discord server, which can be found at the very top of this post. After joining, the signup forms can be found in the #program-info channel or #announcements. Once you reach the end of the signup form, you are all set!  

-----

###Upcoming Dates

**Sign up period -** May 28th - June 2nd; signups end at 11:59pm EST on June 2nd.

**Team selection  -** June 3rd - June 9th 

**Start to End Dates -** June 10th - July 15th

For the most up to date information, please visit our [Discord!](http://www.discord.gg/learningfives) You may also visit our various social media. Twitter [@learning5s](https://twitter.com/Learning5s) and Facebook [@learning5s](https://www.facebook.com/learning5s/).

-----
###How does selection work?

**Coaches;**
After you complete your application, you will be put in a private unnamed team room along with our senior coordination staff.  After sign-ups end on the 8th you will be assigned a personal coordinator who will guide you through the team creation process. **Important Note:** If you are signing up to be a coach and you have NOT coached a Learning Fives team before, you will go through an interview process where you will be asked to review a game proctored by a veteran Learning Fives coach. If you fail the interview, you will not be eligible to coach for this session. If you have valid previous coaching experience, your interview will be waived and you will be allowed to coach. 

**Understudies;**
Should a coach desire an understudy, they’ll select one from those signed up.  You’ll receive a Discord PM from a coordinator offering you a position. If you have not received a PM on Discord or an invite to a team room, it is likely you have not been selected for this session. Unfortunately, there are usually a smaller number of coaches than understudies, so it’s impossible to put you all on teams.

**Students;** 
During Team Selection week (June 3rd - June 9th), coaches will be building teams to their specifications. Once they have found a mix of players that they are happy with, Discord PMs will be sent out to notify you and you will be added to the coach’s team room where they can tell you more about the schedule and their coaching style. Please ensure you put your Discord name on the signup form! This is necessary for us to contact you!

If you have not received a PM on Discord or an invite to a team room by the end of team selection, it is likely you have not been selected for this session. It's unfortunate but the number of student signups we get means that it's impossible to find coaches for all you motivated players. Keep signing up for the sessions as they come and you'll find your way onto a team!

-----
### What is Discord?

Discord is our communications platform. It is MANDATORY for all teams. This allows us to maintain a level of quality and control and prevent unfortunate situations from being outside our ability to help. 

If you are unfamiliar with Discord and how it works, talk to any staff member and they'll be happy to explain the details.

###Frequently Asked Questions

--

Q1. Do you have to be ranked to sign up?

A1. Yes, you must be ranked to sign up.

--

Q2. Does this program run in all regions?

A2. Yes! We do offer support for teams in any region although the majority of our sign-ups come from NA and EUW. If you are not from either of these regions we highly recommend telling your friends and signing up anyway to increase the chances of a team being put together.

--

Q3. How long do we have to accept?

A3. You will have 24 hours from the initial PM from a coordinator to accept your invitation. If they do not respond as soon as you do in the 24 hours you will retain your spot, they are likely helping someone else out.

--

Q4. Can I be a coach/understudy if I am not selected for a student position?

A4. No, we do not currently have the means to accommodate those wishing to switch.

--

Q5. What is an understudy?

A5. An understudy is like a coach in training. If you are not confident in your coaching abilities or do not meet our Gold 3 coaching requirement, this is the role for you! This role is fairly flexible, depending on your comfort you can take on the role of an assistant coach, or be a shadow to the main coach of the team. It’s up to you and the coach!

--

Q6. What if my rank changes?

A6. As long as your rank does not change drastically (3+ leagues) you’ll be good! If you are concerned about it, you can PM @Jarsa (Ben)#8511.

--

Q7. How will we be contacted?

A7. You will only be contacted via Discord PM by a coordinator. Please make sure you put your correct Discord name on the signup form. Make sure your Discord PMs are open.

--

###We ask that Students…

[DOTA] OpTic may be able to qualify directly to The International,16,48,False,False,False,OpTicGaming,1527533005.0,True,"With their second place in Birmingham, OpTic are in 9th position in DPC points, 1 spot and around 120 DPC points away from moving into the top 8 and directly qualifying to TI. However, they did not qualify for the last tournament of the year, the Supermajor, and so had thought to have been eliminated in the search for top 8 in DPC points.

However, recently a number of teams underwent roster changes in DotA in preparation for The International. OG (not OpTic) who had been invited to the Supermajor, the last chance to gain DPC points, have an incomplete roster due to this and will not be attending the Supermajor, leaving a spot available.

These roster changes in OG came as a huge surprise to everyone, but not to /u/madibariddim, who said that it would happen a day ago and was mocked for it. This account is only 1 day old, clearly a burner from someone in the pro scene, and is also sure that it's OpTic who will now be attending the Supermajor in place of OG, due to visa issues etc. With OpTic's form there is a decent chance that they will gain DPC points and hence qualify directly to The International, avoiding the minefield that is NA qualifiers with EG/VGJ.S and other teams.

Just thought I'd post the summary of DotA drama/rumours here for those who don't frequent /r/DotA2."

[Legion Spoilers] The Emperor probably told Alpharius/Omegon about Chaos...,36,96,False,False,False,40kLore,1527519077.0,True,"&gt; Slau Dha (Eldar leader of the Cabal) stepped forward to face Alpharius. The Astartes followed him with their weapons, but he ignored the threat

&gt;‘Well?’ he asked, in halting, thickly accented Low Gothic. ‘What 
is your response, mon-keigh? Do you have the strength to make 
this choice, or are you just as weak and self-serving as the rest of 
your vermin species?’ 
Alpharius gazed at the autarch levelly. ‘I stand for the Emperor,’  he  replied.  ‘In  all  things,  I  am  loyal  to  Him,  and  I  cannot 
break that bond. He has many great ambitions, and the noblest of 
intentions,  but  I  know  that  above  all  else,  He  is  determined  to 
stand firm against the rise of Chaos. He has always known the 
truth  of  it.  The  overthrow  of  the  Primordial  Annihilator  is  His 
greatest wish. So what I do, autarch, from this moment on, I will 
do for the Emperor.’ 

&amp;nbsp;

Some context; This is the moment the Cabal convince Alpharius to ""betray"" the Emperor and join Horus to save the galaxy (the heresy hasn't even started yet!) What's interesting is that Alpharius knows about chaos, as well as the Emperor's view on it. Primordial Annihlator is a term only Eldar &amp; Necrons use to describe chaos, so Alpharius knows what's up with Chaos.

I'm pretty sure the other primarchs were just told Chaos was some xenos infection. "

Idea for XCOM 3 Scenario.,14,87,False,False,False,Xcom,1527520747.0,True,"My first post on this subreddit but I felt this idea was a bit too good atleast imo to skip off on. A lot of people have mentioned the idea of putting an XCOM where you are the invader instead but like others have said, that presents the dilemma of removing the ""underdog"" theme that is going on. Its always possible to make a XCOM like Terror from the Deep as the new setting but my idea actually builds on another XCOM game that had a lot more mixed response. Aka XCOM Interceptor.

Before you bash me for mentioning that game, hear me out.

Lets begin with the scenario, humanity like in the original XCOM has defeated the aliens, Elerium however has now started running out and the Earth is severely harmed by the Alien war forcing mankind to look into space for an alternative source and other key resources. They have now colonized the Moon, Mars and maybe even the asteroid belt. But tensions are rising between the colonies and Earth whilst piracy and black markets have grown stronger. On Mars an alien base is discovered with intact caches of Elerium making it highly sought after but pirates actively prey on the transports carrying it back to Earth.

Here we enter XCOM, using the Avenger designed during the war as a basis. They have become a form of solar police force and are actively dispatching teams to defend transport or engage pirate ships. With over 50 years since the alien incursion people believe that it is over and they won't return, but here is where they are wrong. Suddenly cargo ships start going dark, when found they have been boarded, their content and people nowhere to be seen and fully void of atmosphere. On the moons and asteroids of the solar system, colonists outside the habitats on missions also start disappearing and rumours are abound of energy signatures across the Solar System.

Once more the Council of Nations although slightly changed suspects Alien Activity and re\-activates the XCOM projects for its true purpose.. Hereby you take command as the commander, your objective is to assess the threat, confirm its identity and combat it. The game could add a lot of new features whilst retaining the standard tactical combat. Defending ships being boarded or attacking UFOs you have the old turn based like always, fighting in cramped hulls or across the plains and craters of moons. Gravity, oxygen and other factors could be interesting mechanics altering the battlefield.

High speed interceptors are developed to hunt down UFO's, you need to establish satellites and other methods of detecting UFO across the Solar System and you need to eventually find out where they are coming from and root them out. Interception and space combat will work slightly different than other XCOM games probably and generally you will need to build coverage over time as the solar system is a big place.

Your main headquarters might be located on the moon or something similar but it could still re\-introduce a form of multiple bases again. This would take the form of ""Outposts"" which you establish on the different planets, moons and asteroids to house soldiers and interceptors, you might even specialize to make a ""Science Outpost"" etc. If the aliens find out about these however they will attack and try and destroy them. 

Every Colonial Government also has panic like in the original XCOM but what happens if you lose is that the aliens occupy the colony and instead of blocking it, you have to retake it in some form of multi mission larger assault.

Another point might be that the colony decides to seek alien help in gaining independence, obviously this isn't ""good long term"" for their sake but a power hungry politician or EXALTesque organisation might try to use the aliens for their own good, creating a faction system in which you have to deal with public relations etc.

Anyways this is just my starting points, I will probably invent more in the future but I would still like to hear your thoughts. This scenario I feel sorta equals and moves the playing field but also keep you in the ""underdog"" position as the aliens technology and space thingies are superior to yours, they might not even be the same aliens you fought in the first game or they are and they have had 50 years of advancement trying to seek revenge."

Am I [25F] still obligated to commitments after break up with [37M],129,288,False,False,False,relationship_advice,1527495759.0,True,"Long story short, I’m at my breaking point. The man I have been talking to for 6 months is selfish and disrespectful and physically hurt me with malice the other day. I’ve expressed my grievances throughout and things change for a day or two, then we are right back to normal. Lately, I express my concerns, and we just keep going at it with nothing really positive said or done in between.


Anyway, I agreed about a month ago to watch his kids overnight, dog for a week, then pick him up when he gets back from a short trip with him friend. He leaves in 4 days. Part of me is so pissed I just want to ghost him and watch his plans fall apart eleventh hour knowing that will put the final nail in the coffin on whatever the heck we are doing, but I don’t want to stoop to his level. Should I suck it up and do it? Should I tell him I can’t so he can make arrangements? Should I just ghost him?


Tl;dr: Breaking up with jerk partner, but am I still obligated to upcoming commitment to watch his kids and dog while he is out of town?


Edit: Thanks for y’all’s feedback! I think I’ve known for awhile what I need to do, but doing it is so hard I think partly because of me not being able to stand up to him the way I would like and partly his lack of regard for me. 

I texted him to say I couldn’t do what I had previously agreed to and I don’t want to see him anymore. He like completely disregarded and asked if I would come watch NBA playoffs and cook dinner for him and his kids... Um. What?!




Some people appeared to be curious as context so for y’all and my catharsis: 

We met at a sports bar in Houston where I live. He lives in a suburb about 36 miles from my place, about an hour drive in traffic. There were 2 occasions in the last 6 months he stayed at my place: the first night we met and then the night we went to the Astros game when they were playing his hometown team. Every other time it was me driving to see him or we don’t hang out. It started as an average of 3-4 nights a week, whenever his kids weren’t with him, but once I met his kids he wanted me there too. So for about 2.5 months there have been more nights at his place than not. 

There were days I would work for 10 hours and he was home all day since he is not working and tried to had the fact for 4 months. He is looking for a job, but not very actively. After long days at work, he would want me to stop for food and booze when he literally had all day to do so. He said it only made sense for me to because I would pass the store on my 45 mile journey from my office to his place and god forbid it would take him 20 minutes to get out and do it in traffic. 

Any time I choose to sleep at my place, I get accused of sleeping with other men and he will keep me on the phone or Face Time to verify. One day he hid my glasses to try and keep me from leaving. 

He knows about my sexual history, which is nothing out of the ordinary, but considering how we met, he assumes I’m just willing to sleep with anyone. He repeatedly calls me a skank because of it despite having probably racked up three times as many partners as I. He justifies it by saying men are made to reproduce and nerdy girls aren’t supposed to like sex. Wtf?! 

He always makes comments about me sleeping with other people. He even said something in front of his daughters when I repeatedly mention how hurtful it is!

Meanwhile, he maintains active dating profiles on Bumble and Match that I know of. He even invited another woman to have a threesome with. 

He is quick to tell me when my hair is unkempt or doesn’t like my outfit or whatever, but rarely gives positive feedback so I always feel like I’m guessing on what to do.

He has all kinds of double standards where it’s ok if he does, but not anyone else. Talk during a tv show, on your phone during a ball game, whatever. 

He sort of treats me like a kid and will say things like “don’t make a mess.” When I have asked why it’s necessary to even say that, he said something like I made a mess before, as though I don’t know how to clean up after myself....

He has poor sleeping habits and when he can’t sleep in the middle of the night will wake me up and keep me up in obnoxious ways. Playing music in my ear, tv, constantly talking, whatever. I’ve asked him not to and he has done it at least 3 more times. 

If I kiss him goodbye in the morning while he is asleep I get bitched at for interrupting his dream and won’t hear the end of it all day, but he can wake me up at 2am in malicious ways and it’s fine. 

He makes fun of me all the time. I can handle it to some extent, but he makes fun of things about my I can’t change including my voice, the fact I wear glasses, my hair loss. 

He’ll do things like push my glasses up and I have asked him to 1,000 times not to. If he asks me not to do things, I immediately comply, he takes no consideration to my requests. 

I was in charge of a charity gala 2 weeks ago. He told me around March he would be there, then last minute wasn’t. I looked so stupid trying to explain why he wasn’t there when my friends and family asked. He said he would come to a small get together at my family’s place for Memorial Day instead. Yeah. Didn’t show for that either. 

He routinely will make gestures about choking me if I annoy him. I can recount a few times I’m sure I was drunk and annoying, but for the most part he has turned me into a meek person and I don’t say or do much around him. I sit on his couch, not making any physical contact with him, refilling his drinks because I’m afraid of what he will do if I say no. I’ve started to stand up to him and treat him exactly how he treats me. Evidently he didn’t like that because he did finally escalate to actually choking me. He left a pretty solid hand print around my neck. I gagged and coughed and physically removed his hand from my neck, only for him to grab it again 3 more times. I was in shock, he didn’t say anything afterwards. Ever since I’ve been snapping at him, and he back to me, and I don’t like feeling this way."

Bungie make the postmaster actually give anouncments and detailed reasons as to why something has happened,29,537,False,False,False,DestinyTheGame,1527512444.0,True,"I'm not talking about making the postmaster talk more, I want the messages section to be made useful. (For those that don't know pretty much once a year the post master has a special message for players, guided games tickets came from here for example) they could pretty easily put some kind of message in here with a notification when you land in the tower.

For example, when the rat king was disabled a few weeks ago, the average player who doesn't watch youtube or come to this sub wouldn't know about it, so put a little thing in game that says ""due to a glitch allowing players to break the game, the rat king has been temporarily disabled"" and then when it is re enabled ""rat king is now back and glitch free, gather your crew and try it out."" 

It could also put about world firsts for raids and prestige nightfall highscores, or patch notes or notices for anything in game like faction rallies coming next week ect.

I realise this won't help alot of people on this sub but there are quite a few people who wouldn't know this stuff otherwise, so I think it would be good for most people and would probably take minimal effort. I also realise this should not be very high up the list of priorities. Any thoughts on something like this?"

News sites have been saying it's coming although I haven't been seeing it in regular stores yet.

Some of the questionable popular styles from the decade I can remember:

\-Long tight t\-shirts with \(possibly pleated\) hipster micro mini skirts

\-Hipster jeans

\-Tweed replica suits and imitation pearls in the style of ladylike

\-juicy couture tracksuits

\-Tiny handbags on the shoulder

\-Fake tanning

\-Girly headbands

\-Polos with miniskirts

\-Ugg boots

\-Emo skinny jean scene hair and black eyes

Inspiration: The OC, The Hills, Mean Girls, s1 Gossip Girl, 90210 s1, The Sweetest Thing

Some of the looks I enjoyed:

Natalia Vodianova in Tom Ford designed Gucci

Gemma Ward in Chanel shows

Devon Aoki in Betsey Johnson

Ballet flats

Long line tops

Preppy

A designer that has recently put out literal interpretations of 2000s is the newish label I.AM.GIA, much of it very body baring but I liked the miniskirt on its own, and would wear such a piece with a covered top and maybe tights.

I started off with taking one tab and finishing the USS Constitution quest, but it wasn't hitting so I took another. Went to a nearby park with my friend to wait for the tabs to kick in before heading back for more Fallout. The tabs kick in on the way back, fast forward to talking to Curie. 

She reveals to me that she discovered how to make/improve stimpacks from Mutfruit, which in my drug induced state sounded incredible. I set her up at Covenant in a Mutfruit farm and as a doctor, but Curie's dialogue was sad because I romance'd her and she wanted to come with me. I was about to leave for Nuka World and I couldn't bring myself to leave her at Covenant. I was doing a Minutemen run through and that's when I realized how I needed to finish the game: Save the Commonwealth by releasing Mutfruit stimpacks upon everyone, murder all Nuka World Raiders, and bang Madame Curie all along the way. 

Fast forward to the gauntlet, only thing that kills me is flying ants. After pretending to be their Overboss, I point blank shot Gage in the face with my Plasma Pistol at the Fizztop Grille, provoking a war with everyone. I got high luck and perception by this point, so I stood on the balcony of Fizztop critically headshotting tens of raiders while they exploded in caps, occasionally taking breaks by sleeping/banging Curie (Survival so only way to save.) 

Fast forward again and release Mutfruit stimpacks upon the newly freed slaves in the Nuka World market. Probably my best conclusion to a DLC ever."

VeChain - Future Prospects (Part 1: Supply Chain Transparency &amp; Efficiency),22,83,False,False,False,Vechain,1527520003.0,True,"I've noticed that the bear market tends to bring many - if not most - VeChain investors down. So I thought I'd start a series of posts that would simultaneously cheer everyone up and provide insight into where we are potentially headed with VeChain and Blockchain as a whole. 

*This DOES NOT constitute professional financial advice or encouragement to invest more or continue to hold your VET assets. DYOR always*

**Part 1: Supply Chain Transparency and Efficiency**

*Transparency*

Here's an article from almost 8 years ago: 

https://hbr.org/2010/10/the-transparent-supply-chain

The author stipulates that while governments, businesses and consumers were previously not very interested in knowing details about supply chains, the sentiment has quickly changed: now, ""they worry about quality, safety, ethics, and environmental impact"", to name but a few concerns. 

While companies have somewhat adapted to these new demands, there still lacks adequate b2b, b2g, and b2c trust, especially in certain industries like F&amp;B and Luxury: 

""Broadly, halal, kosher, and organic foods are indistinguishable from the alternatives—the distinctions are important to certain consumers, but in a blind test most would have no way of identifying them. Few people could actually tell the difference between an authentic and a top-end fake Rolex watch or Louis Vuitton bag. Counterfeiting is such a huge problem because, after all, an ethically made shirt looks and feels identical to the sweatshop alternative"". 

The article goes on to identify new technologies that companies have already begun using to provide evidence pertaining to product origin and manufacturing trajectory. But these tech solutions are nowhere near what Blockchain makes possible today and in the near future. 

Here's one section which caught my attention... it addresses concerns that companies might still decide to avoid being transparent: 

"" Even if firms opt to keep their provenance data under wraps, they will have no guarantee that activist and campaign groups—or even competitors—will be so coy. The explosion of global electronic communication empowers those who wish to pull down corporate reputations just as it offers firms the chance to build trust.""

In other words: Fail to be transparent and your competitors will leave you in the dust. It is no longer an option to be deceptive. In relation to VeChain, why is this so important? Because when (not if) a few companies decide to use the platform to ensure transparency throughout their supply chains, there will surely be a massive wave of ""fomo"" among their competitors who will start shaking in their boots in fear of not adopting the latest trend. I can already imagine managerial committees hysterically pursuing Blockchain solutions to showcase their intent to board the trust ship before it sails and leaves them on a deserted island. But that's not all that will scare them...

*Efficiency*

 Remember... Blockchain platforms like VeChain are also inherently cooperative, meaning that they allow for multiple parties to collaborate together seamlessly in areas that were previously at least expensive and at worst cost-prohibitive (Think car manufacturers and insurance companies). Big enterprises know that in today's hyper-connected business world, the last thing they want is to be left out. (Recall Sunny's LAN versus Internet analogy). 

that is without mentioning how collaborating on platforms such as the one designed by VeChain from the bottom up can turbocharge processes that are still very inefficient today. 

Below is an extract from the following article: 

https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/blockchain-supply-chain-innovation.html

""Blockchain provides all parties within a respective supply chain with access to the same information, potentially reducing communication or transfer data errors. Less time can be spent validating data and more can be spent on delivering goods and services—either improving quality, reducing cost, or both.

Finally, blockchain can streamline administrative processes and reduce costs by enabling an effective audit of supply chain data. Processes involving manual checks for compliance or credit purposes that may currently take weeks can be accelerated through a distributed ledger of all relevant information.""

**China and Global Supply Chains**

One advantage that many seem to forget is the fact that VeChain has deep Chinese connections and partnerships, including with governmental departments. If there's one thing we know, it's that China has yet to take a break from its relentless pursuit of global business endeavors, especially when it comes to trade. 

Here's an extract from the following article: 

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-grand-strategy-use-the-world-as-one-large-supply-chain-2016-04-11

""As Chinese growth and consumption surged in the 1990s, it became a huge importer of raw materials from countries that the West began to ignore as the Cold War ended. The saying “Power abhors a vacuum” is itself a synonym for “Use it or lose it.” China is now the top trade partner of 124 countries, more than twice as many as the United States (52 countries). China sees New Zealand as a food supplier, Australia as an iron ore and natural gas exporter, Zambia as a metals hub and Tanzania as a shipping hub. The Argentine scholar Mariano Turzi calls his country a “soybean republic” in light of the shift in its agribusiness to serve Chinese demand. Supply and demand, not sovereignty, is the governing law of the 21st century.""

Why is this so important? Well, as I'm sure you're aware, historically, China and ""corruption"" have largely been perceived to go hand-in-hand, whether it comes to counterfeit products or various other supply chain fraudulent activity. But today, as global traders and consumers have become more aware, the Chinese have a vested interest in showing them that they can be trusted. What better way to do so than by adopting public blockchain solutions, especially one that the Chinese government can trust? It's a win-win situation: Other countries get to tap into various lucrative Chinese markets, and China gets to take a few more steps toward global trade domination!

about fat people logic,46,143,False,False,False,fatpeoplestories,1527508507.0,True,"... why? why do so many fat people think the way they do? I mean, don't they see they can't even go up a staircase without almost fainting? can't they see they can't even look at food without eating it as fast and as much as they can, even if it isn't theirs? can't they see they're not healthy and their health problems are mostly because of being too fat? can't they see they let their children make this poor life choice?

my dad told me about a friend of his with who, one day, he was having lunch. his friend asked him

""why do you eat so little?""

""I don't eat too little, I eat until I feel I'm satisfied.""

""why? do you underestimate food?""

""no, man. I don't underestimate food. the measure of how much I eat is how much makes me satisfied, not how much food we have in the dinner table. if you feel the urge to eat all the food you have, cook for only one meal, you don't have too cook for a week and eat it at once. you can always store things in the fridge to eat later.""

my dad's friend understood and lost a lot of weight after this talk. maybe people are that fat because they think it is natural to eat that much? or maybe they think they're entitled to food, or they can't ""underestimate food"", like my dad's friend? why can't they see it is a problem?"

I've got a live one! Help pls,5,54,False,False,False,neckbeardstories,1527527120.0,True,"So I started a new job last week. I was introduced to the ""team"" a couple of girls and this guy. First thing I noticed about him was the fact that he actually has a patchy neckbeard, glasses, a mouth full of gross teeth and greasy hair. He non stop snivels and clears his throat and cannot stand still for 1 minute like a normal person. Like he swings his arms around and has a generally weird gait. 

I am a girl, very athletic and very social so I don't have a problem getting on with new people but I'm getting extremely creepy vibes from this dude. It's like he's latched on to me. He followed me outside on break and started gushing about how much he loves England (this is a German neckbeard maybe a special case?)  and started asking loads of questions about my personal life and my boyfriend. When I shared a bit with him he starts going on about at his last job how he earned loads of money and he moved away for his girlfriend and then she dumped him. First of all Boo fucking hoo I don't know you and second, no you are no competition for my boyfriend. He also told me he was jobless for a year because he mangled his hand (no scars whatsoever) until he got this position as a temp worker (I am a permy) and that he used to only communicate with people by playing video games.. 

There it was! My first thought after that was oh no this can't be real. 

He also had diabetes and checks his blood as publicly as possible and then checks to see if I'm looking and then went on to complain about how hard it is and it's dangerous ect to all of us kind of bragging about it? Who does that? 

Worst of all I am stuck with him all of this week on the night shift and his words on Friday were (snivels while he speaks) ""I think it's amazing that we have the same shift next week, I can practice my English on you"". Ugh he tries to follow me everywhere and I'm dreading this week. 

Oh and I have worked with him TWICE. Also he stinks.

Seeing the scenes of him going through the what ifs and different outcomes was emotional.

His testimony scene in court I had to pause for a little cry. To see him so burden with guilt and constantly apologising. It was such a good performance by Derek Luke and probably my favourite character arc in season 2."

I submitted a ticket and I heard nothing from it though this was a Holiday Weekend. I found a bunch of threads about false positive bans and one on Reddit stuck. Eventually the community manager saw this and did a great job of responding and asking for player ID information that he forwarded to the anti-cheat team. Clean players had their bans removed. Comment on Riggle's comments to this post with your Steam ID link and your in game player name typed out correctly (https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8mhlgt/whats_with_all_this_ban_threads/) if you are falsely banned. Perhaps we may even be able to get an answer about what happened.

So unless I'm mistaken a PC rolls to spot a trap when they announce they're searching an area for traps, but if they're announcing that they're searching an area carefully for signs of a mechanical trap (that would have an obvious physical implement or trigger in the area) shouldn't the PC just find it automatically?

For traps with something like a tripwire, if the PC is actively searching the area, how could they miss it? Maybe this could just be for simple traps and not complex ones?"

I Sold My Heart To A Man On Craigslist,23,470,False,False,False,nosleep,1527504915.0,True,"It’s exactly as it sounds. 

I’ve had a few drinks, so I’m a little bit more calm now. I’ve had a long day, full of weird crap and an even weirder man, which you’ll be hearing about very soon. But I gotta preface this by saying that I’m never using Craigslist again. As if that matters. Just, please be careful about who you meet online. Please.

I’d just broken up with my boyfriend of two years, after being sent a picture from one of my old sorority sisters of him in a bar with his tongue down some girl’s throat. “Is this Mike?” said the attached text message. The image was super blurry, but I could make out his features, and the tattoo of an eye on his exposed collar bone. It was him.

Needless to say, Mike had all of his stuff moved out within a few hours. Giving him a piece of my mind felt good. But like most breakups, I ended up a crying mess on my best friend Rachel’s bed a night later. To cheer me up, we browsed Craigslist together.

It was kind of an inside joke between the two of us to send the craziest posts we found on Craigslist to each other. I’m sure you know how the site operates. You can find pretty much anything for sale, or anyone. Perverts, dog-walkers, technicians, therapists. Browsing through it was a great way to waste a few hours. But I had never considered actually *using* the site for anything other than memes.

“Look at this one,” Rachel said, pointing to a photo of a guy in a skull mask and a fedora. “He says he wants someone to move to South America with him and….oh…that’s explicit.”

“Jesus,” I giggled. She clicked on the next page, and one particular post caught my eye.

**Looking To Buy A Heart, mfw**

“Huh…?” Rachel clicked on it, and the first thing we saw was this handsome Adonis-looking guy, with the brightest smile I ever saw and wind-swept brown hair that could rival even Mike’s. We were awe-struck by how good he looked, and almost forgot to scroll down to read his actual post.

**Looking for the heart of a beautiful, down-to-earth girl. Must be pure of soul but not pure of body ;). Would love to steal one, but thought that asking would be more gentlemanly.**

**Preferably would love someone with a great taste in music, an open mind and a dog-lover. Leave daddy issues at the door. A healthy lifestyle is important. I believe the body is a temple, so she should, too.**

**Getting to know someone is important. I’d like to take a free-trial before making the sale ;). No Netflix? No problem: my movie collection has been praised for being the best this side of the Mississippi River. If you don’t like movies, we can do whatever you want. As long as it’s not too illegal.**

**I’m in desperate need here. It’s been too long and it’s time I finally meet someone made for me. Maybe it’s you? ;)**

**Serious inquiries only.**

Rachel wrinkled her nose. “Ew.”

“Let’s fuck with him,” I suggested. 

“Really?”

“Yeah,” I affirmed. “Come on, it’s obviously a joke. No one actually talks like that.”

Rachel smirked knowingly. “You’d be surprised. His confidence has to be through the roof with cheekbones like that.”

“Well, even more reason to message him. If he’s genuinely like this, then this tool deserves to be messed with.”

Rachel looked skeptical, but in my current state I didn’t want to be rational. I wanted to be as reckless as Mike was for once. I took the laptop from her and hit the “reply” button. His contact name was Liam Malcolm. Very model-esque. It sounded very fake. Nonetheless, I copy and pasted his email into one of my burner emails that I use for free streaming trials. 

“What should I say?” I asked. “I don’t know if I should be super cheesy or act like I’m totally serious.”

“Imitation is the best form of flattery,” Rachel said. “Maybe sound as shallow as he does.”

I nodded, and got to work. By no means do I think I’m God’s gift to the world, but I tried my best to sound as snooty and particular as possible. After about ten minutes of typing, editing, and raucous laughter, I came up with my reply:

**Hello there. I am very interested in your offer. But first, a few things to discuss.**

**What are the benefits of selling my heart? I have found that with these things, the rewards turn out to be more mediocre than mind-blowing. Are you sure you can afford it?**

**I am a dog-lover, but I’m only willing to meet with you if you have a dog of your own. The number of them doesn’t matter, as long as one of them is of the teacup variety.**

**It’s your lucky day, as I do enjoy to watch movies. However, the only genre I like is romantic comedy. If you don’t have The Hottie &amp; the Nottie on DVD then I’m afraid this may be a dealbreaker.**

**My diet consists of lots of water and green things. Lettuce, bell peppers, avocados, anything green, I’ll eat it. I expect you to do the same.**

**Lastly, my body is a temple, but I’m curious to know how you would worship it.**

“Woah woah woah, too cheeky,” Rachel said. “Damn, I thought you weren’t ready to get back on the wagon.” 

“If you think I’m desperate enough to sleep with a boy who winks as much as he does then you don’t know me as well as you thought.” I said, shaking my head. “It’s all a joke. I’m sure he’s gonna reply to this with a dick pic anyway.”

I sent it.

I woke up the next morning with a hangover and a new email from Liam. Seeing his name made my heart begin to pound just a little faster. Common sense told me to leave him alone, but I was immensely curious. I got out of bed, careful not to wake Rachel, and went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face and read his reply.

**Heya there.**

**Not gonna lie, you seem to be very high maintenance, but that’s exactly what I’m looking for. I love to take care of people, so it looks like it’s your lucky day as well ;).**

**I can also pay whatever you’re willing to shell out. We can discuss payment after a few drinks, if you want.**

**Here’s my number.**

My heart was beating even faster than before. But my brain smacked my heart in the face and reminded me that I had no idea who this guy really was. His name, his picture, all of it screamed “fake.” There was no way someone that good-looking could be real.

And yet, I found myself inputting Liam’s number into my phone.

After a few minutes sitting on the counter, staring at the digits at the top of my messenger app, I typed out a simple “Hey.” It was another few minutes before I gathered enough nerve to send it. Soon after, Rachel began to stir, and I slid my phone into the waistband of my pajama bottoms and went downstairs to make breakfast.

Rachel came to eat after about an hour, her hair still a mess but with a clean face and brushed teeth. We talked a little about our plans for the Sunday until her eyes lit up and she asked me if Liam had replied to my email. For whatever reason, I didn’t want her to know that he had.

“Nah,” I said. “Must’ve scared him off with the temple line.” 

She shook her head. “I’ve heard worst ones, to be honest.”

And so, I texted him any time Rachel wasn’t in the room, hooked to his words. He spoke confidently, and was much more personable than his Craigslist ad made him out to be. He was soft, he was funny, he was charming. He’d even majored in Biochemistry at the same college that I went to. He replied to me almost immediately every time, which let me know he was interested in talking to me. It could’ve just been me feeling very, very lonely, but I didn’t want to stop messaging him, even when I got home later that night.

We set up a coffee date for the very next day. Before I went to bed, I told him goodnight.

“Goodnight, Amanda,” he sent, with his iconic wink face. I didn’t realize it then, that something was very, very wrong, because I was so starstruck. But I hope you caught it at least. 

We met at a coffee shop the next afternoon, a popular one with plenty of witnesses in case things went south. I was nervous, showing up about ten minutes before our scheduled meeting time. This was the first time he would see me. I don’t think I look *terrible,* but compared to Liam, I was leagues below him. And I still had my doubts on whether it was a catfish or not. Regardless, both of us were supposed to be wearing an alumni shirt from our alma mater, Virginia Tech. 

He walked in precisely at 4 pm, our meeting time, wearing a VT t-shirt and looking exactly like his Craigslist ad. Heck, even better. He was tall, wearing shorts that showed off his sculpted legs, and his windswept hair looked glossy and soft. He scanned the room, and his eyes landed on my shirt, then on me, settling on my face.

He smiled, sitting down next to me.

The next few hours were a blur. I felt at ease with him, like I would with Rachel, as we talked about any and everything. His voice was hypnotizingly deep, and his eyes were so very intense. I learned more things about him: he was an only child, worked from home as a free-lance artist, loved the rain and the color red. We’d soon developed a bond, and I was enjoying his company. We didn’t bother ordering anything.

I was happy, for a while.

It was during a very rare lull in the conversation that I noticed the sun was setting. Panic set in, and I checked my phone clock, confirming that we had, in fact, been sitting in the same spot for hours. I hadn’t eaten since that morning. I hadn’t used the bathroom since he’d gotten there. I tried to stand, and my legs wobbled, Liam reaching a hand out to steady me.

“You okay?” he asked, concern in his voice. 

I nodded. “It’s getting pretty late. I should be on my way home…”

“You’re having run, right?” He asked. “You could come back to my place, if you want.”

The “yes” was on the cusp of my lips, but the aching pain in my legs had managed to keep my head semi-clear of the perpetual state of wonder he’d kept me in. I remember what I told Rachel the night before, about not being ready to get back on the wagon. And I knew that emotionally, I truly wasn’t. Liam didn’t deserve to be a one-night stand, nor did he deserve to be a rebound. 

“Sorry,” I said. “Maybe another time? I did have a lot of fun. I’d like to see you again.”

There was a bit of hurt in his eyes at my apology, but they lit up again at the end of my sentence. “Let me walk you outside, then.”

He gave me his arm, and let me lean on him as we walked to my car. There were less people milling around the outside of the shop than there’d been in the afternoon, but still quite a few. I felt safe enough. When we got to my Sedan, Liam leaned against the hood, flashing me with another smile.

“So,” he said. “About our deal.”

“Deal?” I asked. Then I remembered the ad. I grinned. “Go on.”

“I was thinking, maybe…another date, in exchange for your heart?”

“Just a date? I think I’m worth more than that.”

He raised his brows suggestively. “I really like you. I’m sure we could work out *something.* Anything you want.”

“Anything, huh? That’s quite an offer. I’ll have to think about it.”

“You don’t have to decide now,” he said, standing up and facing me. I looked up into his eyes, which regarded me coolly. I remember thinking, I could stare up into them forever. “As long as I have your heart.”

“The way things are going, you’re well on your way,” I murmured. He leaned in, and so did I, expecting a kiss. Instead he grabbed my hand, squeezing it.

“Is that a yes?” He quietly insisted, his breath tickling my lips. My body was on fire, and the butterflies were flapping around inside me for all they were worth. But the sensation was different, different than the first time I kissed Mike or the first time I gave my first oral presentation in school. And I couldn’t put my finger on it. 

But, at that moment, I didn’t care. I thought it was just him keeping up the charm. And I didn’t want to ruin the joke. But looking back, I should’ve just left. Things could’ve been different.

“Yes.”

He grinned, showing off all his pearly whites, and giving my hand a tug. I felt a pinprick there, almost like an itch in my palm, and he let me go, the sensation going away.

“Goodnight, Amanda,” he said, nodding. He walked away, our conversation ended on a rather abrupt note. I watched him turn the street corner and disappear past the shop, as the streetlights finally came on. It was a little weird, but I shrugged it off. After all, it was the first awkward moment we’d had.

I drove home, trying to quell the butterflies inside, when Mike called me. I ignored it, and the subsequent calls he made to my phone. Instead of picking up, I called Rachel, and finally spilled the beans about Liam. She was surprised, but very impressed that Liam turned out not to be a wackjob. 

“You’re going to see him tomorrow, then?” she asked. “Oh my gosh, what if he has like, a giant house. What if he has horses?! I want to ride a horse!”

“I didn’t know you were a middle school girl, Rae,” I teased. “But we haven’t made any plans yet. He wants to see me again, though.”

“That’s so nice,” she said. “Who knew you could luck out on a wacko site like Craigslist. I’m grateful if I find a guy who even remembers my name.”

That was when it clicked. My foot hit the brakes, the sound loud enough for Rachel to squeal and ask me what was wrong on the other end of the phone. I’d had a realization, one that should’ve come up earlier. Not once, in text, or in person, had I told Liam my name.

I relayed this to Rachel, who brushed it off. “He probably looked you up on Facebook or something.”

“How could he? He hasn’t seen me before today. I don’t…I never even told him about myself.” The epiphanies were piling up in my head. All he had was an email I didn’t even use often, one that in no way had my name or age or anything of the sort. “All he knows about me is from that joke email we sent, and that’s not even really *me,* Rae.”

“Calm down. You gave him your number, right? He probably looked you up with that.”

Sure, yeah. But it would’ve been much easier to just ask. “I…guess.”

“Do you want to come over again?”

“No, I’ve got work tomorrow. I’ll be fine. It’s probably nothing.”

“Alrighty, then. Let me know if you need anything. Get home safe!”

I hung up, staring down at my phone. I opened the messages app, scrolling up until I saw the goodnight message from before. “Goodnight, Amanda ;)” Suddenly, I just didn’t feel good. My stomach was in knots. And, sitting stationary on an empty road, I felt very creeped out. It was like I was being watched.

Turns out I was.

I looked up, noticing a light in my rearview mirror. I adjusted it until I could see another car’s headlights, a good distance behind me. They weren’t getting any closer. That car was stopped just like I was. But there were no houses nearby, no buildings, and no one standing outside the car. It was just sitting there, waiting for me.

I put the pedal to the metal and peeled out of there. I took the long way home, driving through a few different neighborhoods. There was a chance that  that car was minding its own business, but my instincts were telling me otherwise. After I was sure I wasn’t being followed, I went home and ran inside, locking the front door and watching the street from my living room window for a few minutes. I didn’t see or hear anything unusual. But I was quaking like a chihuahua.

I went to the kitchen, turning on all the lights and dialing Rachel’s number. Before I could finish putting in her number, I saw that she was calling me. I answered, saying “Speak of the devil” before her panicked voice made me pause. “What’s up?”

“Mike…” she began, “Something happened…something bad…”

“What happened?” I questioned, feeling even more anxious.

“An accident…on the road. I just saw it online-”

“What?” I demanded, getting a little hysterical. 

“He’s died, Manda. Side impact collision. The police put out a picture and his car is…I don’t know. I don’t know. It looks bad. There’s chunks of it missing. It was a hit and run, it looks bad. I’m so sorry-”

“What?” I whispered.

“Manda-“ I hung up, going online to unblock Mike’s Facebook and look at his feed. People were already posting messages of support to his family. I went to my news app next, seeing “FATAL HIT-AND-RUN ON BARKER RD” as a headline.

I saw his picture, one I took of him on vacation. I saw his car, unrecognizable from a giant pile of scrap metal you’d see in a junk yard. It looked like he’d been hit by a freight truck. No one was surviving that.

The guilt is indescribable. He called me what could’ve been minutes before his death. Sure I was deserved in ignoring him, but…I don’t know. We’d been together for two years. I was happy with him. I loved him. I still love him. It’s hard to move on from something like that. Any chance of reconciliation, or even closure, is gone now. Mike is gone.

But you know what the kicker is? I cannot shake the feeling that it’s all my fault. It’s been a few hours since all of that happened. Rachel kept calling me, but I didn’t have the heart to pick up. Her last text was an offer to come over to my place, and at first, I didn’t want her to. Everything felt too wrong. Even going outside felt dangerous. But I got desperate and ended up accepting, but that was two hours ago. She should be here by now, and she’s not answering *my* calls now. My hand has been bleeding for some reason but the bandaids are in the kitchen and I refuse to leave this bathroom floor until she arrives.

And Liam has been sending me so many messages, saying how he can’t wait to see me again. I can’t bear to respond. The guilt is too overwhelming. It feels like I don’t deserve to be happy with anyone else. I debated just telling him not to contact me again. It wasn’t like we could last, anyway. The wink emoticon he sends is getting pretty damn annoying. It’s almost like he knows something I don’t.

Oh, thank God. Someone’s at the door. [Rachel must be here.](https://www.facebook.com/autheauthor/)"

[Manga Spoilers]The beautiful creepiness of certain titans,16,100,False,False,False,ShingekiNoKyojin,1527515597.0,True,"Hi everyone,

I would like to discuss some of Isayama’s artistic choices. There is something in his art that makes the 9 Titan Shifters look like real horror monsters. He always finds the bizarre detail that makes their physical aspects unsettling. I’ll try to put some words on it, for most of the TS. I’ll exclude Armin’s CT and the FT, not enough appearances.

Some of my observations might sound very obvious. Feel free to let me know if so, and to share your look on the subject.

**So, what makes Titan Shifters’ designs so creepy?**

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

*Some wear masks*

* **The Warhammer Titan: the Executioner** \- Its mask looks like a cage. The bars protecting its eyes and mouth make them look sealed, like a messed up allegory of justice. Its hammer’s ridiculous length easily grants it a spot in the Silent Hill bestiary.  
Illustrating panel: Ch.101 when it faces an impaled and lifted Attack titan.  

* **Armored Titan: The Terminator** \- Everything human and fleshy is hidden behind full plate armor. Its mask always looks determined, making him look like a robot, an invincible machine. Reminds me somehow of Gregor Clegane \(GoT\).  
Illustrating panel: Ch.75 when it stares at the horizon on the top of the wall, right before seeing Erwin.

*Some look like animals trapped in human bodies*

* **Cart titan: the Actual Horseface** \- The shape of its head is stretched forward like a horse head. Despite this deformity, it is the most human\-looking of all shifters, yet has the least human behavior. Weird.  
Illustrating panel: Ch. 83 when it faces Hange.  

* **Jaw titan \(Porco Gaillard\): the Feline Predator** \- Has a vise for a jaw. Has a lion's mane. Nose shaped like a feline’s one, nothing human about its face, never takes a human posture. My personal favorite.  
Illustrating panel: Ch.102 when he sneaks behind Eren. This picture summarizes Porco’s Jaw Titan.

*Some look like mutilated human beings*

* **Female Titan: The Flayed Athlete** \- No skin, discontinued Joker smile. The feminine calm expression \(almost kind\) contrasting with uncovered ripped muscles and the circles around her eyes which look like war painting.  
Illustrating panel: Ch.23 when she looks under Armin’s hood. Scariest picture I’ve seen in a manga/comic.  

* **Colossal Titan \(Berthold Hoover\): The Burning Living Man** \- Giant among the giants. Like the Beast Titan, has disturbing disproportions. Its absence of skin reveals its flesh smoking like a burning corpse. The tendons on its face evokes some ~~BDSM~~ Voldo’s facial equipment \(character from Soul Calibur\), imprisoning its face.  
Illustrating panel: Ch.78 when Bertold transforms.

*Some are just plain monsters from fables*

* **Beast Titan: the Hairy Slenderman** \- In addition to its small eyes always hiding any intentions, the absurdly long and thin arms have a grotesque, almost comical tone. They make this titan go from ‘normal giant mammal’ to ‘freaking monster’. It just takes that one anatomic detail.  
Illustrating panel : Ch.75 when it smiles at Erwin with the Cart Titan in the background.  

* **Jaw titan \(Ymir\): the Ogress** \- Mix between a gobelin and a fairy tale witch. Often compared with another fairy tale monster, the Eldian Devil. Sharp teeth with a 24/7 scary face.  
Illustrating panel: Ch.41 right before she tells Historia and the gang to grab on her hair.

*And one just looks degenerated*

* **Attack Titan \(Eren Jaeger\): The Cannibal MMA fighter** \- Absence of lips and chicks makes him look like a skull, always ready to bite. Its eyes are revengeful. On top of that, its incredibly muscular body gives the feeling it can put its threat into action. It does.  
Illustrating panel: Ch.101 when it repeatedly punches the seats

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

I really wanted to share my POV on this aspect of Isayama’s art. I am amazed by how every detail in titan shifters’ design contributes to a sense of dread for the readers.Feel free to share your views on what drawings made you fear the Titan Shifters."

Marijuana in Spain: The Ultimate(ly grumpy) FAQ,27,86,False,False,False,spain,1527517759.0,True,"Q: **How do you guys call it?**

A: The correct spelling is 'marihuana', but almost everybody calls it 'maria' (like the woman's name). Some people use 'hierba' (weed) but it's less common. Those who want to sound formal or academical use 'cannabis' instead.

Q: **It's legal there, right?**

A: For the nth time: NO, IT IS NOT LEGAL. There's a distinction, though:

* Smoking, growing or posessing *small quantities* in public is not a crime --that is, you will not be arrested-- but it is still a misdemeanor and you could be fined up to several thousand euros.
* Selling, and growing or posessing *big quantities* for trafficking is most certainly a crime and you will see your sorry ass in jail.

Here's the catch: the law does not establish clearly how much a 'small quantity' is. Judges use jurisprudence (right now it says about 100 gr.) but it's entirely up to their discretion.

Q: **My friend says everybody smokes there and nothing happens**.

A: Just because a lot of people don't give a shit about a law it does not make it less valid. It is true that we do not live in a police state and there is not a couple of officers in every corner patting us down and checking what we smoke, but the law exists, fines happen, and claiming that 'everybody does it' definitely will not work with the cops.

Q: **What if I have a prescription for medical marijuana?**

A: Good for you, but that does not mean jack in Spain. Again, marijuana is NOT LEGAL in any way or form, including 'medical', with one exception: there is a drug made from cannabis called Sativex that is sometimes prescribed to Multiple Sclerosis or cancer patients. But even if that were your case it does not give you permission to smoke a joint on the street.

Q: **If nothing of this is legal then why are there cannabis clubs?**

A: Cannabis clubs operate in a grey legal area. In the Spanish legislation, 'private clubs' are a group of people that get together for a specific activity, with a specific set of rules, in a specific property. That property can only be accessed by members of the club, which makes it private, so it abides by the rules of any other private property. Therefore, if the members of the club decide to smoke weed it would be like they were doing it in their own homes. But handling big quantities of marijuana can be considered trafficking, which is a crime punishable by jail, so they have to dance around the law to avoid that. The usual method is to only buy a small quantity for each member every month (so it's considered for their own private use), with no profit for anyone involved except the suppliers (who tend to be local growers), and that can only be smoked inside the property. Also, a lot of clubs only accept new members if they are referred by an existing one. Still, many have been closed by the police for their dealings.

Q: **But I've been told of a club that accepts everybody and lets you bring your weed home.**

A: Yeah, that's just a dealer in disguise. Don't be surprised if the police bust them soon.

Q: **What about all those grow shops?**

A: You will only find tools to grow marijuana, smoking parafernalia, and seeds. Legally, selling seeds is not a crime but planting them is. Growing for your own use is usually not punished as long as it is hidden (if a neighbour sees it they can report it) but, again, the law does not establish exactly how much you can grow so it's up to the judges' discretion.

Q: **Alright, whatever, I don't care, will you tell me where to find some weed?**

A: NO. Marijuana is NOT LEGAL in Spain, which means you are asking for help to commit a crime. Also, I don't know if you heard but [Reddit has gotten kinda serious about subs that sell drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/865cl2/megathread_reddits_new_rules_regarding/), and I would certainly like to keep r/Spain off that banned list."

Is starting the decentralisation no priority anymore for the NEO Council?,71,89,False,False,False,NEO,1527516516.0,True,"Hey there,

im a long time NEO Holder, started out with ANS back in the day and i have no intention to change any of that in the future. 

but after a recent comment of one of the CoZ Council reddit accounts on a topic regarding decentralisation here in the NEO sub im a little irritated.

the Post im talking about: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/8m3wgd/what_is_going_on_with_decentralizing_the_neo/dzl5vx5/

to me this sounds like decentralisation has somehow become nothing more than a irrelevant side note on the priority list of the NEO Council.

we were ""promised"" the start of decentralisation by the end of 2017, that is now 5 months ago and still nothing has happened on this front. and whats even worse to me, it seems like this topic is quietly ignored by the council as well as by the community. 

decentralisation can not become a minor goal for the future it needs to be top priority otherwise everything else is completely irrelevant as long as ALL the nodes are in one hand. 

can we please get an in depth update on this topic it has been 5 months. why is only the CoZ ""puhsing"" for such an important topic?

im not even expecting huge improvements but going from essentially 1 centralised node farm to at least 3-4 would be a start that would ease the mind of a lot of people in this community.

everyone that has the success of NEO in their mind i urge you not to just downvote this because its a critical topic but instead embrace the discussion so we can improve what needs to be improved."

She lied about her age,39,162,False,False,False,legaladvice,1527524672.0,True,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons. Recently I met a girl on a dating app that said she was 18 and from South Carolina (the age of consent is 16 in SC). I am 26. While I realize this makes me a creep I was just looking for someone to talk to with no intention of ever meeting her or even making sexual advances. We're talking for about a week, each night her insisting on me sending her a picture, a selfie or a picture of the cat, whatever. I oblige her, having her return pictures of the same nature. Until one night she doesn't beat around the bush and asks for a full nude picture of me, I hesitate and refuse. She then sends me two pictures, one of her in her bra and panties, and one of her sitting in front of a mirror, revealing nothing. Having a few drinks in me, I give in, send the picture, end of conversation for a few days. 

I thought that was the end of that, no big deal. A few days later I get a call from a man claiming to be her father. He found the phone, shes 16, and he is wanting to press charges (idk what type of charges, he did not elaborate) and that he has been in contact with a private investigator. Furthermore, unless I agree to help pay for a hospital bill their daughter now has and pay money out of court, he says he will have no choice but to file charges. 

What kind of legal charges could i be facing? I should mention that i live in a state that is on the west coast, far from SC. Should I have a lawyer yet? Or entertain the thought of paying out of court?

Today is six months since I started my keto journey the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Never expected these results — both in terms of weight loss and overall energy, health and wellness. When I started my ankle was all inflamed and I was constantly exhausted. Now I can run, lift weights and ride bikes with my body feeling great. And I’ve given up naps! 

Thanks to everyone who makes this sub so awesome. This sub was my intro to reddit, too —I was totally missing out! 

Re: work clothes, I’m a lawyer and I need to wear a suit 3+ times/week. I can’t meet with clients or go to court in ill-fitting suits. A little loose is ok, but I’ve gone from 54L to 42L (and from 50 to 36 in the waist). I bought a couple pairs of new suits twice along the way (shopped sales and got meh suits but still a couple hundred $ each) and felt like I was throwing money away given how little use I got out of them. No luck with thrift shops. 

A couple weeks ago I was on eBay and happened on a listing for a preowned suit. Did some browsing and there are a ton on there from a huge variety of designers. It took a lot of time and careful reading to find exactly what I wanted in the condition I wanted but ultimately I got a $2,000 handmade charcoal suit and a $600 navy blazer for $70 and $40 respectively. Spent about $100 on alterations (whoever first bought them had t-rex arms) and now they fit perfectly. I have to say, this is something I could see myself doing even once I reach my final size. 

Passing it along because I was so frustrated feeling like I had to keep buying new stuff of inferior quality. Forgive me if it’s common knowledge. And thanks again for all the support on this sub. KCKO!!

Why do American schools start so early?,182,123,False,False,False,AskAnAmerican,1527509951.0,True,"Here on reddit a little while ago, I saw some people discussing how school starts too early in America. Apparently a lot of high schools start before 8am! This seemed really odd to me because I assumed American schools would start later because a lot of kids make long journeys to school, whilst for Brits it's normally a short walk or bike ride. 

For comparison, my high school (age 11-16) starts at 8:30am and finishes at 2:45pm. I think this is about right. I wouldn't like to start any later because then we'd have to finish later (I like getting the day over and done with), and I wouldn't like to start earlier because I like my morning video game time haha. Some people here still say that school should start later for the non-morning people. My primary school (age 4-11) went from 8:45 to 3:00. The sixth form (age 16-18) I'm going to in September runs from 9:30 to 3:00.

Is it really typical for schools to start before 8am in America, or are these schools just outliers? If it is normal for schools to start very early, why is this/what is the benefit?

One of the most consistent epidemiological associations between diet and human disease risk is the impact of red meat consumption (beef, pork, and lamb, particularly in processed forms). While risk estimates vary, associations are reported with all-cause mortality, colorectal and other carcinomas, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and possibly other inflammatory processes https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299716300401?via%3Dihub

The population-based prospective Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) included 37 035 men, aged 45-79 y, with no history of HF, ischemic heart disease, or cancer at baseline. Meat consumption was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire in 1997. During a mean follow-up of 11.8 y, 2891 incidences and 266 deaths from HF were ascertained. Consumption of processed meat was statistically significant positively associated with risk of HF in both age- and multivariable-adjusted models. Men who consumed ≥75 g/d processed meat compared to those who consumed &lt;25 g/d had a 1.28 (95% CI: 1.10-1.48, P-trend=0.01) higher risk of HF incidence and 2.43 (95% CI: 1.52-3.88, P-trend&lt;0.001) higher risk of HF mortality. The consumption of unprocessed meat was not associated with increased risk of incidence of HF or mortality from HF. http://circheartfailure.ahajournals.org/content/early/2014/06/11/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000921.short

Rise in cancer despite the increase in meat consumption... Hmm interesting let's keep eating meat even though the whole world is sick and dying from it https://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/practice-management/news/online/%7B0112b0ca-8146-43bc-8c02-28eacf156d31%7D/who-projects-alarming-rise-in-cancer-worldwide

There was no convincing lack of association between saturated fat and CHD mortality (1.15, 0.97 to 1.36; P=0.10). For trans fats, one to six prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (two to seven comparisons with 12 942-230 135 participants). Total trans fat intake was associated with all cause mortality (1.34, 1.16 to 1.56), CHD mortality (1.28, 1.09 to 1.50), and total CHD (1.21, 1.10 to 1.33) but not ischemic stroke (1.07, 0.88 to 1.28) or type 2 diabetes (1.10, 0.95 to 1.27). Industrial, but not ruminant, trans fats were associated with CHD mortality (1.18 (1.04 to 1.33) v 1.01 (0.71 to 1.43)) and CHD (1.42 (1.05 to 1.92) v 0.93 (0.73 to 1.18)). Ruminant trans-palmitoleic acid was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (0.58, 0.46 to 0.74). The certainty of associations between saturated fat and all outcomes was “very low.” The certainty of associations of trans fat with CHD outcomes was “moderate” and “very low” to “low” for other associations. https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3978/

Myocardial infarction in red meat consumption by Oxford study Red meat consumption was significantly positively associated with ferritin concentrations and MI risk [HR per 50 g daily intake: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.33)], but no significant associations with stroke risk and CVD mortality were observed. While direct associations between ferritin concentrations and MI risk as well as CVD mortality were significant in age- and sex-adjusted Cox regression models, these associations were substantially attenuated and no longer significant after multivariable adjustment for classical CVD risk factors. Strikingly, ferritin concentrations were positively associated with a majority of classical CVD risk factors (age, male sex, alcohol intake, obesity, inflammation, and lower education). https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/107/1/113/4763681?redirectedFrom=fulltext

From Cambridge study The present meta-analysis indicates that higher consumption of total red meat and processed meat is associated with an increased risk of total, cardiovascular and cancer mortality https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/red-and-processed-meat-consumption-and-mortality-doseresponse-metaanalysis-of-prospective-cohort-studies/C8A39FB2079E0A70FB9F89DC1EBC0448

"Man is told we are out of potatoes, throws a fit when he does not receive potatoes",18,124,False,False,False,TalesFromYourServer,1527519234.0,True,"Long time poster, first time reader, you know the drill. Also my first job in food service ever so maybe this is not as big a deal as some of the other stories I’ve read here but it needs sharing.

So I work as a cashier/food runner at a semi-local fast casual restaurant or whatever the term is. One evening a gentleman calls in to order to-go, and he gets two dishes with a side of roasted potatoes. Unfortunately, we run out of potatoes completely right before getting around to making his order. Luckily, he’s in the store physically, so one of my coworkers, a girl so tiny you could pick her up and put her in your pocket, goes to deliver the bad news.

Now, just for clarity, this is a gentleman with graying hair and a polo shirt tucked into his khaki shorts. He proceeds to not even acknowledge that my coworker is in front of him speaking to him. Looks at her and that’s it. He’s not on the phone, not doing anything, he’s just standing there, waiting for his food. She returns, unsure of what to do, so now we just have to batten down the hatches for the oncoming storm.

His food is ready and I hand it to him. He proceeds to open both boxes and confirms for himself that there are, true to fact, no potatoes. He will be Angry Boomer (AB), I will be Me.

&gt; AB: Where are my potatoes?

&gt; Me: I’m sorry sir, we’re out of potatoes for the evening. If you’d like to order another side...

&gt; AB: (interrupting) This is bullshit. I ordered potatoes, where are my potatoes?

&gt; Me: Sir, like I said, we’re out...

&gt; AB: What you’re trying to send me out of here without my food? I want my damn food!

He proceeds to continue ranting, acting like we’ve just handed him two empty boxes and are acting like we’ve given him food. Luckily for me, my manager was standing right behind me and swooped in to try and defuse the guy while I walked off to go cool off/roll silverware. I think he wound up getting his meal comped, and my manager later told me not to worry about it because he’s a total bro.

TL;DR - The title."

How can a 29 year old turn his life around with online courses and internet?,63,231,False,False,False,india,1527506954.0,True,"Long story short. Graduated as Electronics engineer from a newly opened college. Lower middle class family background. Have been average at studies in school, but extremely bad at maths. Tried finding something to do after college. Got a job as trainee engineer after one year of searching. Was put into programming. Unable to understand it at all had to leave company.

Since then have tried programming in python. Because i was told its the easiest of all. Was learning it for AI/ML job. But i am unable to understand programming. AI/ML is quite difficult, more difficult for me as i am not aware of computer science at all. After that tried in website development. But that also i was not able to understand beyond HTML, CSS. Javascript went over my head.

I have been only doing small jobs like online wordpress website and making some courses and selling online. This gives me money to live in a tier 2 city. In future also i will be getting the same income as i see no option to scale this up. I will have to live my life in sharing rooms in tier2 cities. Making website will require programming. I only know HTML and CSS which are not technically programming, just rattafication of tags and CSS code.

I am sure there should be some course which i can do and get a steady income which can give me more options to live a better and free life.

I am not aiming to become a millionaire. I don't have any vehicle and i never felt i am missing anything. I am just finding something that i am able to do outside of programming and maths. I am not in position to pursue further studies. This has narrowed down my options. In banking exams i always get stuck at the maths section, although it is just 10th level maths. 

Tried searching this line of thought about follow your passion and all. I like planes, jet, fighter planes and know about drones. I have a liking for them.

There are millions in this country who dont even get what i have. Problem is that even after getting the privilege of internet and a computer i am not able to make a life, which is shameful. 

Can anyone here suggest what i should do."

What triggered your fetish?,107,278,True,False,False,AskRedditAfterDark,1527493178.0,True,"I was thirteen when I saw her. Thirteen is pretty much all I was, a boy growing independent with little direction, a boy growing hair with little symmetry. I was doing odd things because I could, pushups in the garage between rehearsing potential conversations with girls, making the ninja swoosh noise for every move I made. Man stuff. 

I walked to the park to read a book. At that time I'd figured that was something a girl might see and think ""Interesting. I'm interested in interesting."" 

About 45 minutes in and having gone completely unnoticed, I realized I'd been reading the same paragraph for 15 minutes while really only thinking about butts. I was in no position to stand up in public. I gave a quick look around before risking a stand and tuck. That's when I saw her. 

COLLEGE GIRL.

She was two trees away, no more than 90 feet beyond some bushes and a picnic table. We were practically cuddling. I decided not to leave. 

She was athletic, taking a sunny break from doing tight athletic things in her tight athletic clothes, laying face down on a towel in the sun. I was memorizing the scene so I wouldn't mess up any details when I told our grandchildren someday when she suddenly looked up and scanned her perimeter. I nearly broke my nose with that fucking book trying to act cool. 

She didn't see me, she didn't see anyone, we were alone together, finally. I know she didn't see me, because what she did next would change mine and my penis's lives forever. 

She lay her face back down, stretched her toned arms behind her back to grasp hands together, slowly knuckling across her lower back. A quick massage turned to a playful tickle from her hips to tracing the waist of her lycra. Back and forth as birds flapped their wings in slow motion probably. 

It was picturesque, the kind of picture you'd hang on a wall or above your bed. I was picturing that exact scenario when she quickly reached into the back of her pants, did two-three quick finger pushups between her butt cheeks and, just as quickly, brought her finger out from that lycra and directly up to her nose.

...wait WHAT?

Before I could decide if what I'd just seen was real, she sniffed. She fucking sniffed making a cute and slightly disgusted little face before sniffing again and rolling over with a big smile. The following exchange took place within me on what I can only assume was a molecular level. 

Me: WHAT THE FUCK?

My penis: You seeing this shit?

Me: What are you doing up?!

My penis: Not missing this shit, that's what. This is fire. 

Me: What even is this?!

My penis: I'm 90% sure she just did a scratch and sniff test on her asshole. 

Me: Girls do that?!

My penis: THAT girl just did. She's perfect. 

Me: That's gross!

My penis: Oh, no. There's nothing gross about her. She is the sex. That's the most natural, innocent yet dirty and hottest thing I've ever seen in my life. Balls are gonna love this when I tell them. 

Me: You sure?

My penis: Trust me. 

Me: Always. 💚

My penis: Always. 💚 

I found the courage and the right angle to stand up and get home. I sealed the curse with several sacrificial beatings. 

I now have a specific form of olfactofilia. I'm turned on by the smell of (attractive) women's armpits and 24 hour post-shower sweaty asses. And to think, if she'd gone to the library that day instead, I may be into light spanking or something really boring. Like monogamy."

Overload Shaman Meta Crusher Deck Guide,25,41,False,False,False,CompetitiveHS,1527532195.0,True,"Hello,
I have recently discovered a great Shaman deck against the current meta. It is just defensive enough to live most aggro mach-ups and has a nearly unstoppable win condition. The whole deck centers around discounting your Snowfury Giants to 0 then using Ancestral Spirit and then Greater Sapphire Spellstone for four deathrattle resummon 8/8 giants! This deck is great against the current meta as no deck besides priest and warrior (2 card combo w/ armor) can stop it. I got to legend from rank 4 with a 62% win rate (40 wins 25 losses).

**Match-ups**
Most match-ups are played pretty similarly. You want to have your anti aggro tools like Doomsayer, lightning storm, drakkari defender (dangerous to keep early, but can be useful), and draw if you have something else to play early. Against control you want to keep spellstone in your hand all the time. It is too valuable to get this rolling. Other than that you will just want draw. Once you hae the spellstone you can draw into everything else pretty easily.

**Win condition?**
You will win by staying alive, clearing board, and comboing on turn 9 or 10.

Early game you pretty much just draw, totem, pass, or clear the board. You want to make a point of holding off on using your big overload cards like Drakkari Defender and Earth Elemental until you have spellstone in your hand. Only use these without spellstone if you have to for staying alive or necessary tempo.

Your winning combo is Snowfury Giant into Ancestral Spirit into Greater Sapphire Spellstone. You will have four 8/8 giants with deathrattle resummon. The only classes that can clear this board completely are priest and warrior. Priest have psychic scream, which you want to do your best to bait out and play around. Warriors have reckless flurry (if above 8 armor) into brawl. This will leave one giant up but it very situational for the warrior to have.

**Good to know:**
Another key to this deck is spacing out your overloads properly. You want to do enough to stay alive but be able to make a good play the next turn. Make sure this goes into your decision making. I can go more in depth if there is interest.

When you first clicked on this post, you probably thought you were going to be reading a heartfelt goodbye debate post about how great this activity has been to be for the past four years, how much I’ll miss the community, and what the future of things like /r/Debate and PF Videos will be.  I’ll get to that, but first I want to challenge each and every one of you to read this long and equally heartfelt post about the current state and future of Public Forum.  

**Trigger Warning: I briefly mention sensitive material related to sexual assault, ableism, and misgendering, but do not go into significant detail or description.**

Part One: The Current State of PF

Public Forum Debate is an activity in which debaters pretend to be policy-makers.  One team argues the pros of a policy, while another team argues the cons.  In order to debate solely about the merits of a policy, we usually assume voting pro means passing the policy.  Then, we don’t have to worry about debating things like the likelihood of that policy actually being passed, so that way we can just examine the effects. This imaginary world of assumed passage is called “fiat,” latin for “let it be done.”  Debaters and judges pretend that voting one way or another will change the real-world.  This format, as we are told, best trains students to be informed citizens and future policy makers in the world.  Live-action role playing, or LARPing, allows debaters and judges, many of whom are lay, to gain informed and balanced opinions on a topic, so they say.  There’s just one big, multifaceted problem: Public Forum as an event is plagued with sexism, heteronormativity, ableism, elitism, and racism.

It is undeniable that there exists a substantial gender gap in Public Forum debate.  A recent study I conducted with the help of Ben Shahar found that only 38 percent of PF debaters are womxn, and female teams are expected to win about 37% less rounds at any given tournament than male teams.  While the statistical methodology of the study has been discussed in length, it takes just a cursory glance at a high school cafeteria mid-tournament to notice the disproportionate male presence in PF.  

As discussed in Ahana and I’s TOC Octofinals round against Millburn CZ, there are several potential causes of this disparity.  One important observation made was that the male-female participation rate for novices in middle school and in freshman year of high school are nearly equal for many teams.  This implies that the overall gap that exists is largely a result of disproportionate rates of attrition; female debaters leave the activity more quickly than male debaters.  This could be because of implicitly or explicitly sexist comments made on ballots (e.g. “your skirt was too short,” or “you came off as bitchy”), which discourage females from continuing to debate from the get-go.  Most coaches in the community are also male, which creates an implicit barrier for female debaters to find a mentor and garner assistance to improve.  Moreover, because male debaters are generally seen as “more successful and promising” than female debaters, a disproportionate amount of coaching resources and time is likely to be devoted to male debaters.  Even outside the formative years of debate, males tend to create exclusionary “boys clubs” within or across teams while prepping or at tournaments.  A former debater once confided in me that as the only female on her team who travelled, she was often stuck in her hotel room alone while the males on her team would be together separately.  In my own prep group, La Altamont Lane, I always felt myself calling my male friends for hour-long prep and strategy calls, often leaving out my own female partner from the prep process.  These processes often send undertones to female debaters that “you are not welcome here.”  

I strongly encourage everyone who has not already done so to watch the discussion in TOC Octos, which explores these processes in further depth, and from the direct perspective of female debaters.  

One of the least discussed issues in Public Forum is heteronormativity, or the exclusion of LGBTQ+ debaters from the community.  As a few have remarked previously, our discussion of structural barriers in PF debate is problematic in its universally binary language.  The question shouldn’t just be about “male” and “female;” we need to be cognizant of the kweer bodies which surround us in the PF community, but who struggle to find a home in debate.  

There are several barriers which preclude LGBTQ+ participation in PF (although these are by no means exclusive to the PF community).  Debaters, myself included, often have a habit of misgendering other debaters inside and outside the round (“he” instead of “they,” “she” instead of “he”).  Judges and fellow debaters will often mock the feminine or masculine looking debater who has an “improper” sounding voice relative to their appearance, not realizing they are transgender.  

Ableism also plagues the PF community.  Within the first year of my life, I was diagnosed with moderate Asperger’s Syndrome, a form of Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  I did not say my first word until the age of three-and-a-half. I was also diagnosed at the age of six with Auditory Processing Disorder.  Rarely could I listen to something one time and actually understand and comprehend what was said.  Although I received a lot of intervention throughout my life, I still struggle with these learning disabilities on a daily basis.  For the longest time in debate, I could barely respond to my opponent’s case because I couldn’t understand or articulate what they argued in their case.  I had wonderful ideas and thoughts to share with the world, but I struggled to find my voice that could properly articulate my ideas in an appealing manner.  Have you seen me debate and wonder why I have a weird speech pattern, look in odd directions while speaking in round, or why I clench my phone and make rapid hand and arm gestures while I’m speaking?  These are byproducts of my Autism and the intervention I have received to cope as a result.  You know who did notice?  The judge who felt the need to give me a 25 or a 27 once a tournament.  

Low-income debaters from under resourced communities also struggle to compete in PF.  We pride ourselves to be the “most accessible” debate event, but fail to recognize that in order to get to the TOC, one has to have an expensive suit, tens of thousands of dollars for coaching, tournament, and travel costs, and the time and family support to do prep or fulfill a judging obligation; it’s hard to find high-quality evidence when the computers at school are the colorful Macs that Steve Jobs introduced back in the mid-90s.  

This form of elitism also has implications for race.  Notwithstanding implicit and explicit judge biases, the racial disparity in wealth translates into a participatory disparity for people of color in debate.  This year, there was only one African American PFer at the TOC.  Last year, there were none.  

Part Two: Progressive Argumentation In PF

This post thus far is complicit in our community’s complacency towards addressing these structural barriers.  For the last few summers, VBI and NDF have had “inclusivity sessions” dedicated to discussing structural barriers in Public Forum.  The NSDA hosted a conference this year on inclusivity in speech and debate, and currently has a taskforce dedicated to mitigating structural barriers in debate.  Quarry Lane and Westridge both hosted PF womxns invitationals this year.  My study, released in March, provided a foundation for future statistical exploration of the gender gap in PF.  Ahana and I’s concession in TOC Octos was supposed to spark a wave of discourse to challenge our conceptions of debate and find solutions to very real problems of inclusivity.  But where is the change?  What is taking so long?  Are we too busy cutting our “immigrants are rapists and criminals” responses to appeal to the judges at NCFLs?  Do we think we’re doing enough because Gigi Wade was first speaker at TOC, Anika Sridhar won TOC, and Walt Whitman MM was in finals at TOC?  Do we think the discussion we are having is enough to overturn over a decade of structural barriers in PF?  Or are the people who are finally mature and notable enough to facilitate change just put-up with the community, and ready to give up on PF because it is “too toxic” or a “waste of time” after high school?  

The answer is no, we are not doing enough.  When we are fortunate enough to have these conversations, our community obsesses over whether sexism or racism in debate exists, rather than talking about how to fix these issues, or taking real and meaningful action to change.  Public Forum needs to structurally adjust, for the better.   

When was the last time you heard a poem in a round?  When was the last time you heard someone talk about the way H-1B visas affect their personal lives for the entirety of the round?  When did you ever hear someone challenged for not providing a trigger warning or misgendering their opponents in PF?  Ask yourself why these things don’t occur in PF, but why they do in policy and LD.  Ask yourself why many policy and LD debaters are disadvantaged youth who need this space as an outlet, but never even consider doing PF.  Ask yourself why you can’t foster that space for them. And you’ll realize why you should change your behavior as a member of the PF community.  

Almost every debate in PF history has been evaluated in the post-fiat world, that is, through LARPing as policymakers to pass or not pass a policy proposed by the resolution.  In Policy and Lincoln-Douglas Debate, it has become a common practice for debaters to make arguments that either don’t defend the resolution or don’t look at the round from a utilitarian framework of “producing the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people.”  

In LD and Policy, many debaters run Ks, performances, or other pre-fiat arguments to reject the certain societal norms, or to shine light on pervasive discrimination in the status quo.  However in Public Forum, most debaters and coaches avoid these types of arguments because PF is “supposed” to teach us how to communicate to the layperson and discuss so-called “real” issues.  As PF debaters, our first instinct is to cut as many impacts to lives or poverty or GDP as possible.  We’ll frantically message our partners or make Reddit posts when we find the card which says H-1B visas could create 1.3 million new jobs in American, but happily exit the tab when we read about how those same H-1B visas exploit immigrant bodies.  After TOC, I talked to several prominent debaters who all told me, “H4s was probably the truest argument on the con, but it didn’t feel like a big impact that could outweigh the aff, or something judges would vote for in round.”  As a community, we reject discussion about the most vulnerable in society, and instead prefer to argue about issues that seem more appealing or important to us.  Has anyone bothered to research how NAFTA directly facilitates gendered violence against maquiladora workers in Mexico, or how NAFTA has displaced thousands of kweer farmers in Mexico who sought refuge on their rural farms from anti-LGBTQ+ violence, but who are now forced to illegally immigrate to the U.S. because our legal immigration channels actively discriminate against kweer folx?  How about Justin Trudeau’s new gender initiative as an addendum to NAFTA?  These aren’t obscure arguments; I found the evidence in one Google Scholar search.  Will we hear these arguments on stage during finals?  Probably not, because we’d rather talk about the impacts that appeal to the judges who, mind you, are likely middle-aged white male coaches who fled LD and Policy after debaters there woke up and stopped LARPing.  As prominent policy debate coach Dr. Shanara Reid-Brinkley wrote in her doctoral dissertation, “the ‘objective’ stance of the policymaker is an impersonal or imperialist persona. The policymaker relies upon ‘acceptable’ forms of evidence, engaging in logical discussion, producing rational thoughts [...] such a stance is integrally linked to the normative, historical and contemporary practices of power that produce and maintain varying networks of oppression. In other words, the discursive practices of policy oriented debate are developed within, through and from systems of power and privilege.  Thus, these practices are critically implicated in the maintenance of hegemony.”  

The dominant hierarchy of PF has become so entrenched that we actively demean debaters for reading non-utilitarian impacts.  After TOC Round 4, over a dozen friends, lab mates, and acquaintances of me and Ahana were all willing to overlook our individual friendships, histories, and relationships with each other and come to the conclusion that we were “running stupid Policy arguments to try and win rounds.”  No one stopped to even think about the merits of our H4 argument.  Instead, people who I thought were friends or mentors messaged us, “you’re an asshole.”  It wasn’t until we conceded our elimination (and last ever) round that these “friends” even considered the truth-value of the argument, or our motivations behind running the argument.  We were lucky; I had a cushion of white male privilege, clout, and wealth to fall-back on.  Imagine what happens to the Indian debater who is on an H4 visa and is new to the community and tries to argue in front of a lay judge that the exploitation their family experiences is more important than a two percent increase in the judge’s already six-figure wage.  

The issue extends beyond the arguments we read.  For example, debaters and judges alike are obsessed with hearing and reading qualified academic evidence; meta-analyses, statistics, academic journals are the gold standard for evidence in PF.  What about the personal experiences of marginalized debaters?  No, those are “hypothetical” or “anecdotal” or “small-scale impacts,” so we’re taught throughout our careers.  Moreover, the traditional PF style of speaking slowly is shaped and inherently slanted towards white able-bodied males who dominate public discourse and policymaking, and have done so for most of history.  Society prefers hearing the white cis male give a political speech because it is so accustomed to hearing white cis males doing so for centuries.  Harvard University psychology professor Mahzarin Banaji (et. al.) indicates that “we show greater trust in members of groups towards whom we implicitly feel more favorable,” a bias that slants against disadvantaged people.  The same holds true in debate, and this is a large part of why PF has such a diversity problem.

Excluding debaters for running non-traditional arguments, or even erasing the notion of entertaining these arguments, excludes minorities and disadvantaged peoples from the debate space.  Debate is an escape for many marginalized people.  Non-traditional arguments provide an outlet to hold and share extremely important discussions about a wide range of issues that we can change.  For one, debate can be a home for the high schoolers who cannot be themselves at home, school, or public.  Hearing a performative case about kweer experiences gave a debater I know the courage to come out to members of the community, because that in-round discussion sent an important signal: “you are not alone, and debate can be a home for you to explore and discuss these issues.  Debate can allow you to breathe, and to help identify who you are.”  Additionally, debate educates and prepares the next generation of policy makers and public figures for the real-world.  Upholding the discriminatory and exclusionary status quo by excluding non-traditional arguments from PF only exacerbates and perpetuates discrimination for future generations.  It does not teach us to include disadvantaged peoples in social and political discussions.  It doesn’t allow us to discuss pervasive forms of discrimination to raise awareness, meaning issues such as H4 abuse go unchallenged.  This sets a dangerous precedent for the future, because while we may all think “let’s only talk about lives and jobs and GDP to appeal to the lay judge in round” right now, that mentality will easily turn into “let’s only talk about lives and jobs and GDP to appeal to the white middle-class voters in the upcoming election” when our community trains the next Ted Cruz.   

PFers claim to be “woke” or “progressive,” but are often complicit in exacerbating the very structures they decry in collocqual discussion, in Facebook comment sections, or in class discussions.  When our community asks, “why should we worry about fixing sexism or racism in the community if these are all societal norms,” the answer is simple: the standards we set now and instill in our community are the standards that Devesh Kodnani, James Chen, Kelly Zheng, or other “Most Likely To Rule The World” superlative winner will carry on with in the future.  


But wait, don’t non-traditional arguments have to be “spread” -- I want to preserve PF!  Speech events like Original Oratory and Dramatic Interpretation prove that creating a safe and inclusive space for students to share their stories and experiences can still be done and communicated in a lay manner.  We just have to let these marginalized people feel comfortable doing so first.  But don’t non-traditional arguments exclude debaters by creating a higher barrier to entry?  This doesn’t have to be the case.  If you are about to cry out to your friends, Redditors, and coaches because you just lost to a pre-fiat argument about correcting the policy bias in PF, recognize that every argument has a claim-warrant-impact structure.  You could have answered these arguments in the round, but you choose not to, because you were shook, confused, and disrupted.   Check your privilege, and learn about these issues to actually engage them in the future.  What happens if these arguments are exploited and used to commodify suffering as an excuse for the ballot?  Well, it is impossible to judge whether someone is reading an argument ""genuinely.""  In order for someone to read a “genuine performance,” they first need to be given the opportunity.  Moreover, even if someone doesn't ""care"" about the argument, the fact they wrote and researched the issue demonstrates some degree of interest, and it's well documented that how we research and talk about issues (in debate, for example) affects our thought processes and interests in general.  

So what can our community do?  Let’s not be afraid to read arguments that impact to structural violence.  Poverty is a good starting point, but dig deeper.  Debaters, try to argue and explore an argument that you can’t necessarily relate to as a white cishet male.  The more frequently these arguments are run, the faster PF “flow” judges and lay judges alike will vote for them.  At worst, it’s impossible for a lay judge to vote under a utilitarian framework if both teams impact to sexual assault or racism.  At best, when lay judges start hearing about invisible violence more frequently, the more inclined they will be to believe the possibility that their (usually) privileged point of view may not allow them to see or comprehend more pervasive forms of inequality or violence in the real-world or the debate round.  Running these arguments means that schools with a “traditional” coach can’t hide behind their normalized and exclusionary barriers in debate.  They can’t avoid learning about or thinking about or preparing for or teaching non-traditional arguments; they have to confront these arguments head-on, or they will lose.  Don’t be afraid to read reasons why structural violence comes first.  Don’t say deplorable things for the sake of winning a round.  At CHSSA States this year, Ahana and I left a round where our opponents came up to us and said, “sorry we were saying really racist and sexist things in the round, but we had to respond to your neg, and we couldn’t think of any other way.”  Winning is never an excuse to promote hurtful rhetoric in an educational environment.  

Judges, consider changing your paradigms to be more open to non-traditional impact calculus or arguments.  As a judge, I will default to structural violence impacts first.  Don’t disregard the notion of a performance argument or a structural violence impact because you don’t understand it or are afraid of it being too “policyesque” for you.  Instead, be open to hearing the stories of oppression or structural violence, whether it be related to debate, a personal experience, or directly related to the topic.  Coaches, stop teaching your debaters that winning is the most important part of a round.  Debaters need to be held accountable for their in-round rhetoric, discourse, behavior, performance, and the like.  Don’t teach your debaters to try and “outweigh” sexual assault with their jobs impacts, or say “we don’t care about the immigrants or people in India because it’s a U.S. policy action.”  You’re just impressing racist, xenophobic, and imperialistic tendencies in them.  

PF debates about policymaking is good and important for training future policy makers and for education.  It isn’t good at the expense of inclusivity and progressiveness.  PF should find ways to foster productive modes of discussion and education such that we can change the way people in this community think and approach issues of oppression.  We should be a challenge to oppressive forces.  This post should be the first step of many actions on the road to making the activity of Public Forum debate accessible, safe, and liberatory for womxn of color like my partner, and for people with Autism like me.  For the various disadvantaged people across the country.  For the people who can only be themselves in debate.  Where else do they go?  Why can’t they stay here?  If debaters continue to lose on these arguments, they leave debate (or PF) because they can’t make these arguments here and be recognized as legitimate and relevant voices and in turn, debate is reserved for white cis able-bodied male debaters.  It’s time to bring debate back home.  

Part Three: Goodbye

In this post I propose one simple action the PF community can take to combat structural violence in debate.  It is a panacea?  Absolutely not.  Can it help mitigate the dangerous norms of the status quo?  Absolutely, just as it has done so in Policy and LD.  Is what else can we do?  Lots.  Tournaments should take action to become more inclusive.  They could increase their entry fees by $20 across the board and use the revenues to provide full scholarships to low-income debaters to attend their tournament.  More camps should hire people of color and womxn debaters, and should also do more to include low-income and marginalized debaters in their programs, such as the efforts made by Capitol and VBI.  First-year outs and other coaches should look-up and offer to volunteer with Debate Spaces, and organization built to dismantle inequality in middle school debate.  The list of potential actions the community can take is endless.  

Debate is the most imperfect but important activity one can participate in during high school.  But you all know that.  Chances are, if you are reading this post, you are already in debate.  So I’ll say this: I hope that the seemingly random events that have shaped my career are an inspiration to future generations of debaters. To the students at a school who don’t have a debate team, this is for you.  To the novices in a team who aren’t allowed to try to qualify to the TOC or even learn how to flow, this is for you.  To the hardworking debater trying to break at their first tournament ever, this is for you.  
 
Ahana and I debated eighty-three rounds together before we received our first bid.  Debate requires patience and commitment.  So many debaters work hard but are quickly burned out of an activity because they don’t see immediate success.  Please, never give up on the activity.  It does really take a thousand nos for a single yes. Your moment of success will come soon, but no one in debate was ever successful overnight or without hard work. You may be sitting alone in a dark bedroom reminiscing about the bad rounds you’ve had this past season.  It’s ok to reflect, but don’t mourn your failures for too long.  Take your disappointment and rage, harness it, and put it towards striving for better. Let it fuel the hours of additional prep and practice speeches you will do, so your previous tournament is the last tournament you don’t break at.  Don’t watch out rounds at tournaments or online videos of the Arnesens and say, “I want to debate like them!”  I spent years trying to mimic Max Wu, Harrison Hurt, Devesh Kodnani, and the Arnesens as I gave shitty rebuttal after shitty rebuttal.  It didn’t work.  You have your unique style; find it and treasure it.  Learn from the great debaters of the present and the past, don’t try to be them.  Why would you want to limit yourself to their accomplishments?  But even at the end of the day, if you are at the end of high school, and you are reading this thinking, “I never had the success he did,” results don’t matter.  No one at UChicago idolizes Max because he finaled at the TOC two years ago.  The friendships, experiences, memories, and skills you have or will acquire in debate are priceless.  They are the reason people will remember you or know who you are in the future.  
 
More importantly, to every person who feels like they do not fit in this community, whether it be because of sexual orientation, economic class, or learning disability, I promise you, you do.  We are at a turning point in the community, now, more than ever, we need you all to speak out and share your experiences.  If not for yourself, do it for the thousands of future students who will face similar struggles to you in this activity.  
 
To answer the question, “What will happen to /r/Debate, PF Videos, and Allen Abbott now that you are out of debate?”  I will go to college in the fall, along with everyone else writing a post like this. But I will never forget what this community and activity have done for me.  I will remain as involved as possible in making debate a safe and open space for every person.  I will continue to post PF Videos, I will continue to try and convince UChicago professors to do AMAs on PF topics, and I will continue to try to contribute to this thriving community for the better.  I will be coaching for the foreseeable future.  I will definitely see you all at tournaments next year.  Stay tuned for some really cool projects for the debate community that I’ll be introducing soon.  

So then, why am I saying goodbye?  I’m saying goodbye to the harmful practices of the current Public Forum, and saying hello to the wonderful potential this event has.  
 
Thank you all for a wonderful four years.  To quote my Common App essay,“the sun sets on another day in /r/Debate.  Students across the country are going to bed.  Within a forum we all have helped to make safer and more supportive, they are more ready than ever to wake up early tomorrow and spend the day practicing speeches, researching topics, and most of all, learning from each other in this vibrant online community.  Tomorrow, and for each day in the future, the sun will rise again to repeat this riveting cycle that has tens of thousands hooked.”
 
With peace, love, and sincerity,

"Wings' Surgery lies exposed: My story of being approved for a gastric sleeve procedure with Dr. Fernando Garcia. (warning, a bit long)",30,103,False,False,False,PKA,1527531963.0,True,"TLDR: Wings lied about his flights for surgery, he lied about previously booking it for late April, he lied about rescheduling it, and he is lying about having to lose weight before the surgery, because they don't give a fuck, and he probably lied about 4 other things related to it.

Wings is a bad liar, but he is an exceptionally obvious liar to those who watch him religiously. I fall into that camp. I've watched Wings since Boogie2988 made a ""good luck"" video for the boot camp. Of course, Wings has explicitly said that he doesn't lie anymore, so let's hold him to that standard:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOhuFjgO4c0&amp;t=762s

The most glaring tell Wings provides is that the minute he does something productive in his life, he is SUPER eager to tell everyone about it. It literally is a time stamp of his activity.  

So use these as examples:

1) Wings goes to a bariatric seminar in Conway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHhVGOjsWIc&amp;t=272s

vs.

2) Wings says he has to reschedule his late April surgery.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJcbmLa-d6k&amp;t=13s

When Wings does something, he lists the date and gets into specifics. Here? He scheduled it for ""late April"". He said in a previous video that he had already purchased tickets (no date) for a surgery that would be ""basically around May 1st"" because the surgery scheduling takes ""about 3 weeks"". 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOhuFjgO4c0&amp;t=1436s
(first 3 minutes or so)

I think it was at this point that I called bullshit. And someone has to do the legwork, so I decided to. So let's go into the brief history of his surgery. 

Where is he getting it? (first 15 seconds)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlSSo11FTB0&amp;t=150s

Who is he getting it with? (first 30 seconds)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlSSo11FTB0&amp;t=671s 

Now what is really curious about this is his claim that he knows two other people who did it with Dr. Garcia. That's strange, or his family and friends are really stupid. Tijuana Bariatrics is a facilitator company: they headhunt people on the internet for surgery and get paid a cut for finding people. They are like a temp agency...but like any temp agency once you get a job somewhere you can go directly back to the source. Why wouldn't his family and friends save him the money by helping him ""buy direct""? Who knows. Anyways, as they state quite explicitly:

"" Tijuana Bariatrics LLC is a facilitator company providing scheduling and marketing services. It is not a medical facility or healthcare provider. ""

(Evidence, bottom of page) https://www.tijuanabariatrics.com/about

Anyways, all of the surgeries are done through CER hospital, which if you look at map, is essentially a few blocks from the Tijuana  Bariatric center. I went directly to the source and booked my surgery with Mr. Garcia directly.  It is also why my forms look slightly different from Wings (when I show the screenshots).

Sorry for the long URL, couldn't shorten it:

https://www.google.ca/maps/place/CER+Hospital/@32.5232052,-117.0152777,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80d9483ff08eae45:0xd6508fccbc320e2f!8m2!3d32.5232052!4d-117.013089

So here is the timeline of my experience. I logged onto the CER hospital website:

https://hospitalcer.com/bariatricsurgery

I used the friendly chat option and they emailed me an intake form. I received it on May 24, 2018 and sent it out same day.

https://gyazo.com/015abb931c95668a897285a200c7fc70

I filled it out. Wasn't hard. Here are screenshots from parts of it (it was long, if you want a long form example go to the TijuanaBariatrics website, they have the form online). 

I received my answer in 2 days. TWO DAYS.  Meaning, all of that shit Wings posted he would have received two days after sending in his forms.

This is the exact same surgery with the exact same doctor that Wings has. I have the exact same surgery coordinator as he has. But let's trace what Wings posted and see if his previous statements line up.

As you can see, the information is the same. He's only posting what he wants you to see. Same doctor, same hospital, except Tijuana Bariatrics has their own pilfered material that obviously mimics what the hospital demands. 

Most importantly, the screenshot is VERY clear that he is being asked to schedule his surgery. This is NOT A RESCHEDULE. This is the exact same confirmation that I received in two days. I had to send in absolutely nothing. They required no medical bloodwork, no referral information from my doctor, despite saying that I had high blood pressure and that I was 465 lbs, same age, same height as Wings. 

Just like me, all Wings had to do to schedule it was pay $500 USD. I am expecting an email back from the coordinator today to ask more details about how long the surgery takes to schedule (to do a proofcheck on his 3 week claim) and how much he would have lost for supposedly rescheduling at the end of March. 

This is the video where he truly busted himself (first 3 minutes):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zodQFQVhqc&amp;t=2s 

Lies. It is true, the coordinator calls you about scheduling the surgery. But that's where the truth ends. First, you schedule the specific surgery, so you don't inform them of what ""package"" you want. Second, she calls you before you put down the $500.00 deposit, and once you pay it, she schedules you as SOON AS YOU WANT IT. She does not work with you...she schedules your surgery and makes sure the hospital gets its cash. That's it. Your surgery is paid for through a third party company, although I am asking if I can do a ""half/half"" plan. 

The nutrition plan is not 1200 calories a day. It says nothing of the diet outside of a high protein low sugar diet along with 12 dieting tips (lots of water, blah blah). Even the pre-op liquid diet, which I was told to follow for 14 days, is not CALORIE RESTRICTED. They recommended 1200 a day, and just reserved the right to cancel if my liver was blown up like a balloon animal.

It's clear we received the same package. He's simply regurgitating the ""post-op diet"" one page insert that I linked above. 

Bonus: You need to be down there for 5 days, not 2. They are very clear about that. I think I'm even further along the process then he is. I'd be shocked if he has even put down the deposit yet, and if he has, he literally just did it. 

Late Edit: My email correspondence with the hospital. You can book it in 3 weeks, but you need to spend a minimum of 5 nights there. Wings mentioned what he read on the website (that him and his mom would be there for 2 nights), so I really don't think he has made it this far into the process (pre-deposit), which means he literally spent 10 minutes on his application. He's clueless about the 3 nights you need to spend at the actual hospital after it is done.

https://gyazo.com/e55a35cf63c3cd3df7bb751f28cad87f

Edit while Wings streams: First of all, he actually is an idiot, because it took me 2 emails to schedule the surgery directly. I also have direct evidence of his ""pay half now pay half later"" is bullshit: You have to pay the money the day of, and I quote: (I'll screenshot later if someone NEEDS it)

""You may pay the remaining balance the day of your surgery in cash, cashier's check or debit/credit card (Visa or Mastercard only. A 3% fee is charged with the use of the card). All payments are in US dollars.

Remember you must follow the pre-op diet for how long the Nutritional Guide I sent you states based on your BMI. 

Have an excellent day!""

Pennsylvania residents hearing strange noises in the night,51,196,False,False,False,UnresolvedMysteries,1527509125.0,True,"[Pennsylvania residents report hearing mysterious explosions, feeling ground shake](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pennsylvania-residents-report-hearing-mysterious-explosions-feeling-ground/story?id=55407783).    




Investigators are trying to get to the bottom of puzzling reports from residents in northeastern Pennsylvania, who say they heard loud booms and felt the ground shake in the middle of night.

Since April, people living miles apart in areas of neighboring Bucks and Lehigh counties have called police about hearing explosion-like sounds that apparently rattle their homes and shift the ground beneath them.      





Some witnesses have described the noise as a loud thud, while others said it's more like an underground blast.     




Spokespersons for the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said both agencies are assisting state police in the ongoing probe."

The scene surrounding Humbert's last night with Annabelle was pure, unadulterated, english-bending magic.  

&amp;nbsp;

He plays on our most vile curiosities: what do two children do if they really like each other? His answer: they still try to do it. What would it be like if they tried? And the narrator is not ashamed in the least to share the vile details: their attempts and inability to satiate their hunger for one another- raw, fundamental, exploratory- was, as I shamefully felt, vexing and frustrating. Nobakov's ability to tamper with such taboo, to force your interest and subconscious support, is why the reader is manipulated into investing their time in this world.  

&amp;nbsp;

And the horrifying way he draws you in: you may realize that you want Annabelle &amp; Humbert to be happy, despite them being children and their goal being sexual fulfillment, and you must be frustrated when their childhood impotence solidifies their failure to find that happiness within each other.

And the imagery, my god the imagery. His descriptions have the rare quality of stretching the imagination, the kind in which its words play a movie in your mind. That night at the mimosa grove, with ""the haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honey-dew"", was surreal, extraterrestrial, heavenly, so perfectly picturesque.

Anyway, I was scrolling through Instagram, like one does when awoken by a screaming child. I came across a wismec post for their new device, the Hiflask (I follow them because they send me products), and I noticed it had a comment on it.

Naturally curious as to what this one comment was, I clicked on it. [Here](https://imgur.com/MICWPtD) is what I stumbled across, and subsequently responded too. 

Now I may have been a tad harsh in my reply, after being ripped out of a sound sleep by a screaming child, but I digress. Elitist vape bros really irk me, because they act like anyone who isn't vaping their way is fucking wrong and only their way is right. (Btw, hes got 5 posts on his instagram and he uses a sig fuchai 200w and a smok tank, so he has no right to be an elitist dick.)

Please don't act like this guy, don't gatekeep our community, and don't look down upon people for the way they vape, even if they're stupid about it and don't know basic common vaping knowledge. Educate people without shaming them, because while they should know better, they may not have been taught in the first place.

I know I was an asshole back when there were no mods that cared, because ECR was basically the wild west and we had to self police like there was no tomorrow.  Thankfully we don't have that problem anymore.

So this PSA is also kind of an apology. To any of those who remember me as a huge dick, I'm deeply sorry. I feel like it's my duty as someone here who has a bigger voice in this community now to be accountable for that, and man up about it. It's because of this community I get to test and review all of these new products and give my opinions to you guys and hopefully help guide you on the next mod or atty purchase.

Have a good Memorial day everyone. I'm going back to sleep."

Setting up an efficient Jazz Practice is both important and difficult. You have to take care to spend your time efficiently and not have unrealistic goals or expectations. This video goes over some things that you want to think about and consider when you are learning jazz or any other style of music like jazz (though it probably applies to studying other styles as well). It is coming out of my own experiences with a few suggestions from people like Allan Holdsworth and Peter Bernstein.

Having the right mindset when studying and learning music is extremely important and I am curious what you think about this 10 topics, so please chip in with thoughts and suggestions!

Symbolism in The Neon Demon,11,111,False,False,False,TrueFilm,1527508929.0,True,"The most pivotal scene in the film, to me, is Jesse's runway transformation, revealed as a 2001-esque dream trip down the runway.  Jesse sees the lights ahead of her [as a compound triangle, like the Triforce symbol made famous in the Zelda video-games](https://imgur.com/RYqhpsT). She then sees a version of herself in a prism, a double tetrahedron.  The 2D compound triangle symbol can be folded to make a 3D tetrahedron. [In the 3D form, this object seems to resemble a diamond or jewel](https://imgur.com/5CLb5PA). The diamond is both a symbol of glamour and currency.  The version of herself Jesse sees in this prism is reflected on either surface, as though in a mirror.  [She turns to kiss her reflection on either side](https://imgur.com/bsAF3xo).

This is a powerful moment of transformation, in which Jesse goes from being aware of her own beauty, to loving it, and loving herself.  It is her transformation into a state of narcissism.  From this point her character values herself as much as everyone else does.  She's done with Dean, and the rest of the film takes on a far more surreal tone.

Some other thoughts:

In the beginning of the film we see Jesse [lying in a sofa that resembles the cross-section of a free-standing bathtub](https://imgur.com/QVQlSmr).  She lies in an empty vessel.  Her throat is slit and we see camera flashes, suggesting police photographing a body.  The camera pulls out to reveal a photoshoot.  I believe this is particularly foreboding of her death in an empty swimming pool, another empty vessel, drained of promise.

[When Jesse stands at the end of the diving board, looking over the empty swimming pool](https://imgur.com/GpqTV95), I couldn't help but to think now that she has embraced the gift of her beauty, she is seeing it now as an empty curse.  Upon the runway when she embraced her beauty, it was freeing and empowering and her life ahead was full of value and promise.  Standing before the empty pool she has realized the emptiness of that promise; any room she is in, everyone wants to screw her or use her.  She will never be free of the predatory nature of the industry.  The photoshoot at the end occurs in front of a full pool, and depicts the beach and luxury and sun and everything the successful models have attained.  Later Ruby bathes in a full bathtub of blood.

The film is filled with predators that want the commodity of Jesse's beauty, whether for sexual gratification or other reasons. The biggest threat comes from her three rivals, who want to destroy and even steal her beauty (through cannibalism, how about that!). The cannibalism and murder might  have seemed like they came out of nowhere, yet we were softened and forewarned to this shock throughout the film.  Early in the film a rival model attempts to suck Jesse's blood when Jesse's hand is cut on broken glass.  [The wild cat in the hotel room](https://imgur.com/ExUY8zz) seems to be a symbol of feline/feminine predation. In mansion we see [a snarling taxidermied cheetah](https://imgur.com/elkh6Cz).  Not only is the film telling Jesse to get out as soon as she can, but that her biggest threat will come the rival women surrounding her.

&gt;Edit: Ruby draws two Xs in lipstick on the mirror before beginning the other features of what seems to be a dead-face emoji.  This might be a stretch but maybe you can see where I'm going....

There's also some a lot of symbolism going on with Ruby that I don't quiet get. She's a makeup artist. She doesn't have absolute beauty herself, but uses makeup to mimic it.  She works at a funeral home, touching up corpses, and even molests one that seems to resemble Jesse.  After the cannibalism, she lies in a bathtub.  Later she's watering plants and [lies in a shallow ditch that we can assume in the top of Jesse's grave, surrounded by an abundance of flowers](https://imgur.com/CNtxXz7).  There's something going on with death/dirt/life/rejuvenation.  This is all still a bit mysterious to me.

Things other redditors have pointed out (sorry, I didn't jot down usernames when I read these things):

* Early in the film Ruby says 'Are you food, or are you sex?'.  When Ruby's sexual advances are foiled, it isn't very long before Jesse is eaten.
* At the end, Gigi begins to feel sick, as though her body is rejecting the meal she had eaten.  She's the one that has had all the plastic surgery, and is not naturally beautiful.  Her body rejects the beauty that she has ingested, causing her to throw up and disembowel herself (bit extreme, yeah.)

Other Mysteries:

* Why does Gigi vomit up an eye?  Why does Jesse say that she thought the moon was one big eye, and dies on her back looking up at the moon?
* Gigi kills herself in front of a sofa that repeats the triangle/diamond symbolism. [Are those swastikas on the walls? Could that really be unintentional](https://imgur.com/mPGekQR)?

A delivery driver comes in carrying 2 very large insulated bags of food (the ones they put pizza boxes in). He sits it down on the floor and says he has a delivery for a guest named ""john guest"". 

I look it up. ""I don't see that name. You got a room number? Sometimes other people order food that are staying in the room but the room isn't under their name""

""Nope. Just a name""

""Hmm. Let's see if maybe I can find them by first name. Nope. Nothing. Did they give you a phone number to reach them at?""

""Ugh..... nope. Of course not. I bet this is fraud. They bought all this food and there's only 4 people supposedly. Ugh......""

He goes outside to get another 3 bags of food and brings it inside. Nobody comes down.

He sits in the lobby for 10 minutes to wait.  He comes back up to me and shows me his phone. ""See? You don't have John Guest?"" 

""Nope""

He sighs and scrolls down further and I spot the total... Something like ""$350""

Then he finally gets on his phone and calls his boss and tells him what happened. The boss tells him no other contact info was given so to bring the food back.

The delivery driver gets irritated and rants to us about how this is probably fraud and now the food is going to get wasted. 

I tell him ""yeah people suck sometimes""

""You know what? You guys hungry? I don't want to waste this food and it's already paid for. So here. Have it all"" 

""Oh my! But won't you get in trouble if they call back asking where their food is?""

""Nah. They didn't leave any contact info. It's their own fault.""

So he pulls 3 huge boxes of chicken enchiladas, 3 boxes of beef enchiladas, a big tin of beans, 2 bags of chips, 4 tubs of salsa, 2 tubs of guacamole, 2 tubs of melted cheese, and 2 large bins of apple pie. Then he said ""hang on There's more in the car""

He goes outside again and comes back with 2jugs of lemonade and 2 jugs of tea... and more tins of beans and tamales. 

""There's still more but I really wanted to keep some for myself and my partner. But that should be plenty""

We thank him and dig in like it was our last meal. "

The first time I [18F] was slutty,3,37,True,False,False,SluttyConfessions,1527532171.0,True,"My immigrant parents wouldn't let me date until college. All my school friends were having boyfriends and there was this constant drama and sexual energy around me. That got me more anxious and it was some what hard. Although they eventually let me have a boyfriend, I was very anxious and felt left out during most of my junior year.

When I was still a virgin and in my junior year, my parents wanted me to learn driving and setup an instructor. Mark was a sweet guy, probably in his early 30s, fit and trim. As we got along, we used to talk about school, our lives, movies, TV series etc. When the topic of dating came up, I told him how my parents were imposing restrictions and how my friends were having fun. He said it must be hard and asked me if I was interested in any guy in school. I received attention from a couple of guys and told him the same. Mark said I was a very good looking girl and it shouldn't be hard. I told him he was handsome and there was this moment of awkwardness when our eyes met. 

As our classes progressed, I opened up a little more and I asked him about his sex life. He became more free as I was the one bringing up these conversations. I was very self conscious and I asked him about sex and how it feels etc. He told me to just be free and be myself and things will fall in place. Don't stress over it was his advice. I told him it was hard to not stress over it. 

I had few classes left over with him. I decided to tease him a little. It was a warm day and I was wearing a sundress. I gave him a tight hug at the start of the class. After some driving, I told him I touched myself the previous night. He looked at me shell shocked. He grinned and asked me to focus on the driving. I told him I couldn't as I was horny. He was professional and asked me to focus. My classes ended and I got a driving license.

After a few weeks, I bumped into him at the gym that I started after I got the license. He was surprised to see me and asked me how the new driver was doing on the road. We resumed our conversation and after a couple of times, started talking about dating and sex. This time he was very straightforward and real. He told I was a hot chic and admitted that I did tempt him during the driving lessons. I told him I masturbated thinking about him. That caught him by surprise.

He followed me out of the gym towards the parking lot. He asked me if I have seen a dick for real. I didn't so I said no. Mark opened his car door and asked me if I want to see one. I had a few seconds to decide and my hormones took me over. He slid his shorts down and pulled it out. I don't remember but it was definitely not short. He took my hand and placed it on his dick. I slowly stroked it with my hand as we kissed. 

Mark then asked me to strip completely naked. As I got undressed, he looked at my body without blinking his eyes. He told me I was a slutty girl and ran his hands playing with every inch of my body. This was the most pleasurable time of my life. I was dying to please and be pleased. I was not disappointed at all. He kneaded my tits, pinched my nipples and fingered me to my first orgasm ever with a man, all the while telling me how much I troubled him during the driving lessons. I was in ecstasy.

He then asked me to suck his dick and gave some instructions. Having watched enough porn, I tried my best. He came all over my face. After that he spread my legs and fingered and ate my pussy. I had another orgasm and felt so relieved and satisfied. He offered me napkins to cleanup. After that I went back to the gym to get showered again and returned home as a good girl.

I turned 18 a few months back, finished my high school and I can't be more excited about college. "

Get paid to eat...sorta,5,46,False,False,False,beermoney,1527527428.0,True,"I wasn't even looking for it, but I stumbled onto a really good deal this morning on Swagbucks. If you sign up to Blue Apron through their link, they give you $35. Now, Blue Apron is normally WAY overpriced (IMHO), but this Memorial Day weekend (I assume this means it ends today, but if you're finding this post later, it's worth seeing if they continue or repeat it) Blue Apron is offering a $40 credit on your first shipment. With that discount, there are several packages that come in under $35 AND offer free shipping. I went with the 2 meals for 4 people option, which came in at $31.50. Note that the cheapest option, 2 meals/2 people, you have to pay for shipping, so you're probably better off going with one of the higher options, which start at $19.50 if I remember correctly. Net profit of over $15 on that delivery...not bad.

I know SB doesn't like it if you sign up *just* for the bonus, so I'm going to keep my membership for a full month. I don't know if this is strictly necessary, and obviously it is up to you if you do the same. I do know they say they take 32 days to credit the SB for this offer, so don't expect a quick payout. Would love to hear others' results if they snag this deal. 

BTW, you can skip deliveries at any time, so if they don't have anything on the menu that sounds tasty that week, you can always postpone and only pay for weeks that have dishes that suit you.

Assuming this works out, it allows me to eat for free for a few meals, and even make a couple bucks on top. If it doesn't (e.g. SwagBucks reneges) the $31.50 for 8 meals still isn't a terrible deal.

I'm assuming it's verboten to post ref/nonref links, and probably pointless anyway since everyone on beermoney probably already has a SB account. 

I'm pretty sure this deal is only available in the US. Sorry I haven't figured out flairs...I don't post often, but I couldn't help but share this deal!

I miss my Sonny.

I started listening to EDM when I was 18, back in 2010. I remember the first dubstep song I ever heard was Swagga by Datsik. I had no idea what the fuck I was listening too and it rocked my world. Fast forward to October of 2010 when Scary Monsters came out. My life would never be the same. I’ll never forget the day in the dorms at UNR (University of Nevada, Reno) in the fall of 2010 when my good buddy Grant came and got me to come to his dorm so he could show me this song that “I just had to hear”; It was cinema the Skrillex remix. When the drop hit, holy fuck. Made me instantly go check out who Skrillex was. I fell in love with his music from that day forward and have been one of his biggest fans ever since. I love Sonny and all his music. ALL of it. Whenever I hear a Skrillex song at any show I lose my shit. Always.

With that being said, I’m having a huge issue right now with not getting any classic Skrillex. It fucking hurts…. I absolutely love and respect what he’s done. The dude can literally make anything, Jack-U, Dog Blood, Purple lambo, Justin Bieber, So am I, Would You ever, humble, favor, the list goes on and on.. You name it Sonny can do it. That being said… 

Sonny, I fell in love with you for your take on dubstep. I don’t know you, but everything I’ve read and watched I can tell you are a genuine, nice, cool dude that I would probably cry if I met… You are everything an idol should be, you made me believe in myself and the fact that I can be great at whatever I want to do in this world. Ill never forget something I read about you where you said that its so good for all these kids to be producing nowadays, trying to make music for the world no matter what kind of experience they may or not have. Who cares, at least their putting effort and trying. It was one of those, “fuck yea, Sonny” moments. You’ve changed my life in more ways than you’ll ever know but dude…. You cant just leave dubstep forever. 

When you brought us your music back in 2010 you touched the hearts of a lot of people, people who will bump Scary Monsters today, and just as hard 50 years from now… I totally respect what you’ve done musically but you can’t just leave your true die-hard fans in the dust with all your new projects. You made genuine fans by your style of dubstep, and you cant just leave that forever. You can branch out all you want, and with all the possibilities with music you can continue to explore your creativity easily, while still making your classic spin on dubstep and it just hurts that the last thing I got was Red Lips DUBSTEP-wise. Purple Lamborghini is sick as fuck and I love what you did with it, combining hip-hop and dubstep perfectly, the sonny way. 

But c’mon dude… A single here and there, maybe a three track EP…. Something every now and then to keep us dubstep kids satisfied. All I’m saying is think about your fans, the ones like me who have a Skrillex tattoo and have had dreams of the day they will meet you because of how much your music has touched their hearts.. 

I fucking love you dude &lt;3

Yes there were African descended knights, they did exist and can easily be researched. However, for the most part knights were white Europeans. The widely (and I use that term loosely) accepted equality that we have today didn't exist 75 years ago, let alone from 1000AD-1500AD. It's like me saying 12th century African warriors were actually white for the most part. Doesn't make a lick of fucking sense does it? The Moriscos in Iberia were widely known African descent knights that were treated as such and had all the power of a full on knight but they didn't even pop up until the 1400's. Yet they are still the exception and not the ""rule"" per say. Black knights **DID** exist to some degree; if you're already posting a reply calling me racist then you didn't read TWO sentences into this rant and you're the type of idiot I am ranting about today so fuck off dick bump.

Ultra Tinfoil Hat Conspiracy Theory: Baku the Mooneater is a twisted manifestation of Countess Ashmore(!)'s mind under the Witchwood curse (bonus conspiracy theory inside),37,238,False,False,False,hearthstone,1527522019.0,True,"Ok, hear me out on this one.

So I was reading through the Mysterious Missives (quick shoutout to u/PushEmma for your post debunking the odd/even Gilneas lore post, and for exhorting everyone to read up on Blizzard's lore for themselves), and I realized there was some small amount of lore, albeit very cryptic lore, on some of the more intriguing Hearthstone-exclusive legendaries--Lady in White, Splintergraft...and Countess Ashmore. Not much is known about this supposed noblewoman. No one can recall her lineage ever having existed before the curse, but when she appeared, so did an official record of her extensive family tree. So, we can already be pretty sure that she's not who she says she is. If she's not a human noblewoman, then who is she? All signs point to her being, well, a dragon in disguise. 

Now, this part might not be a shocker to some of you if you've ever played the card--her helmet has horns on it (or, more likely, it's her actual head that has horns), and when you play her, you can see the giant shadow of a dragon slowly touching down on the ground before she appears on the board. That's fairly interesting in itself, but what's really interesting is how this may tie into the phantasmal serpent Baku the Mooneater.

Here's an excerpt from Baku's lore as noted in the Mysterious Missives:

&gt; Our arcanists’ initial hypothesis is that Baku may in fact be the tormented psyche of a dragon whose physical form is trapped within the bounds of the Witchwood, but outside of physical reality—some kind of dream-dwelling projection of this dragon’s mind, warped and twisted by Hagatha’s own nightmares.

Let's look back at the limited lore we have on Countess Ashmore:

&gt; Rumor has it that she’s researching the curse, and she’s been seen asking questions of those who claim to have witnessed dragons in the wood.

What does this mean? According to this evidence, there's a strong possibility that Countess Ashmore, or whoever she really is, has been affected by the Witchwood curse, causing this dragon to have powerful nightmares when she sleeps. These nightmares are then in turn corrupted by and mixed in with Hagatha's own nightmares (according to the arcanists' theories), creating the frightening dream vision known to those who dream of her as Baku the Mooneater. Though Baku doesn't exist physically, it's noted that:

&gt; those who dream of her tend to slowly descend into a fugue state—neither waking nor dreaming—and develop the ability to manifest their will in surprising ways.

So the second part explains Baku's card effect upgrading your hero power--her dream influence is able to make you more than what you were and grant you surprising power, but as mentioned in the first part, this comes at the cost of one's own will. Baku's dream power puts one in a zombielike trance in between waking and dreaming, barely lucid at all, after too much exposure. Now let's go back to the Countess for a moment! What's her entrance quote?

**""My power over you grows stronger yet.""**

That's right, the Countess is *aware* that her dreams manifest themselves as Baku the Mooneater, and that this nightmare creature saps people's free will and twists the minds of those that resist. She's gloating at her ability to manifest her power this way, and this is reflected in her card's power: All creatures of Gilneas and the Witchwood, once they have succumbed to her influence, are hers to command--whether they've been granted Rush, Deathrattle or Lifesteal powers, eventually they will submit to her as the final price, and so she draws them from your deck to be used at her leisure. 

Why is she ""researching"" the Witchwood curse, questioning people who claim to have knowledge of it and interrogating people who have seen dragons in the woods? Simple: She has full knowledge of the curse already--it's to isolate and then kill off or enslave anyone with the potential knowledge to *stop the curse from spreading.* But wait! Why would I assert that Countess Ashmore knows everything about the curse? What does she stand to benefit from the curse's continuation? Isn't she being forced into these nightmares from the curse's effect? Who IS she really, anyway?

To answer these questions, let's go back to the assertion that Baku is:

&gt; the psyche of a dragon whose physical form is trapped within the bounds of the Witchwood, but outside of physical reality—some kind of dream-dwelling projection of this dragon’s mind.

We mentioned Countess Ashmore previously as being the most likely dragon responsible for the dream manifestation of Baku, but there *is* one more notable dragon from this expansion, isn't there?

A dragon who once served Ysera in the *Emerald **Dream**,* but who was twisted and corrupted into a powerful antagonist serving the *Emerald **Nightmare**?* 

A dragon confirmed to have power over nightmares, and whose quote is **""Be reborn in the curse!""**?

Hagatha is not the source of the curse.

**Emeriss is the true source of the Witchwood curse, and Countess Ashmore is her human form.**

Wowpedia notes that:

&gt; Reports from the few who survived encounters with the dragon told of horrifying tales of putrid mushrooms erupting from the corpses of their dead companions. Emeriss was truly the most gruesome and appalling of Ysera's estranged green dragons.

Emeriss's curse, as noted in her card text, gives her the power to grotesquely warp anything she touches, granting them immense power but turning them into monstrosities in the process. Emeriss's curse is innate, granted to her by the Emerald Nightmare, and it's now her goal to spread madness and destruction to the world by spreading her curse--the Witchwood curse--starting with Gilneas. 

However, a gigantic nightmare dragon would raise too many red flags, so Emeriss spends the majority of her time in human form as the mysterious Countess Ashmore, having ""...taken up residence in an old manor that’s been abandoned since before the first battle of Gilneas"" in order to keep a close eye on things without being too conspicuous. Even in dreams, Emeriss does not truly rest, utilizing her Emerald Nightmare powers to *deliberately* manifest her will as the phantasmal serpent Baku, and being able to further spread her curse by invading the dreams of anyone within reach and corrupting them from the inside out. 

As Ashmore, she is able to get close to the general populace and weed out anyone with the potential knowledge to stop her, but it's likely that she's unable to stop the more powerful heroes like Darius Crowley and Toki without revealing her true draconic form, so in those instances, she prefers letting her most powerful minions do the work for her: Glinda Crowskin, Captain Shivers, and yes, even Hagatha is a pawn under her influence, mistakenly believing that she herself is pulling the strings and that she controls the Witchwood. Hagatha is indeed an extremely powerful shaman, but this is why Emeriss chose her as the face of the Witchwood curse--the nightmare dragon needed both a powerful (if unknowing) servant and a face for the Gilneans to direct their anger towards while Emeriss continued to work in secret. Crowley and the others may believe that they have saved the Witchwood by defeating Hagatha, but Countess Ashmore's--Emeriss'--true plans...are only beginning.


**TL;DR Countess Ashmore is actually Emeriss of the Emerald Nightmare in human form, is the true source of the Witchwood curse, and manifests her nightmare power as the dream serpent Baku the Mooneater while she sleeps.**

"Guys, videography is hard.",20,44,False,False,False,videography,1527525181.0,True,"I mean, I'm sure it's obvious to you, but I don't think I appreciated just *how much* work went into this stuff, and how many things, especially *little* things, can go wrong and fuck everything up.

I got into videography after the 2016 election. I've always been into editing, but it really kicked into high gear after candidates started coming out of the woodwork, and I realized I had a skill that could come in handy for them. I started investing the money I made into better gear, and slowly my work became more complex. First I just set up a camera and a microphone. Then I learned to monitor audio. Then I learned to setup my lights. How to frame properly. How to interview to get the lines I wanted. I thought I had this in the bag.

But it isn't just getting stuff right behind the camera. It's making sure it *stays* right. And doing it quickly. There are the obvious things. Is the shot in focus? Is the audio coming in clear? Is my white balance right? But then it builds up. It's the little things. Is my talent's bra strap showing? Ah shit, I forgot to tell them to pull their shirt down. How long has that air conditioner been going? Okay, time to move to another room. Oh fuck, I forgot to re-do my focus after moving. It's fine, I can auto white balance this one time. Oh shit it's *not* fine. 

Learning all this legal crap on the fly. Making sure not to get logos in the shot. Having the talent show up in a shirt that makes the camera glitch up because it didn't even cross my mind to let them know not to do that. 

There are so many things to keep track of. So many little things that can fuck things up just as much as big things. It's hard. It's rewarding. But I've nearly fucked things up, and through clever editing managed to cover it up, but it's only a matter of time. I've recruited a friend a couple of times. She has a thing for photography, and sometimes thinks she isn't doing much, but just catching my fuckups before they happen so I can focus on everything else is very helpful.

I just wanted to say this is hard, and you people on this sub that do it professionally and proficiently are incredibly talented. "

What's going on in this subreddit?,19,42,False,False,False,fasting,1527525928.0,True,"I've been lurking and browsing this subreddit for quite a while now, But opened up a user only a short while ago to ask a question. This time I'm going to share my thoughts and give a constructive feedback.


I noticed some very bad thing happening in this subreddit, When I search for ""follow-ups"", ""long term""  there are almost no long term follow-ups after 4-5+ days fasts. Almost every posted follow-ups of extended, Multiple day fasts are reported in the same day of ending the fast or during the fast. 99% of the posts are about fasts done today, Or last week, Or next week. I know this is how the internet works, People are creating users and move on with their lives and forgetting about this subreddit, But this is really ending up causing positive bias in finding out what is the truth. Because this subreddit lives ""on the moment"", The here and now, It makes people to think fasting is wonderful, They see the end result posted as pictures or logs at the end of the fast, Yes, These people lost alot of weight and are extremely happy with this and share their enthusiasm with everyone else and that's true. What's going to happen to them in two years? Nobody knows. Will your body send you into a fattening spiral of lowered BMR for all your life? Or would you do this and really lose weight long term and your BMR would only reduce itself to your life-long standard level according to your new 
 leaner weight?


Long-term follow ups are desperately and urgently needed in order to verify what is true!! People are reading this subreddit and risking their lives trying out this stuff which has almost no data at all and no logs or posts for what will happen in the future, No people who talk about it and share their experiences (because they all leave this subreddit and never return to post a follow-up), And no proof from anyone that this stuff actually works long-term.


So, What did happen to that guy who posted about fasting for 20 days straight a year ago? Or that guy who fasted for 10 consecutive days two years ago? Or that guy who fasted for a week repeatedly for months 1.5 years ago? Or what will happen to that girl who fasted for 36 days in one year from now? Who starred in the front page for days? (the OP is named Olivvvve)
Will she be sorry to find out that this short term success would result in her lowering her own BMR forever? Or will her BMR remain functional and would only be reduced relative to her new and lower weight?
From what I know, in CICO, In the Biggest Losers show, The BMR will get lowered beyond the relative weight. It will be much lower than if this person had been weighting that lower weight from the first place. When they return to their original weight, The BMR stays lower than what they had started with, they feel hungry, They eat at the same amounts, But end up regaining even more. This effect had persisted for more than 5 years after they reduced their caloric intake and exercised. Their bodies experienced an energy trauma, It's a permanent effect, And it's well documented.


It could also be happening with extended fasting, And fasting in general gradually over long periods time. And maybe it actually doesn't matter if you would do this lowering your calories like in CICO, Or like in fasting, You will always get the same response?


The only follow ups that do exist (which are very few in this subreddit, Are anecdotal on the subreddit because these experiences and data is very hard to obtain), Show that most of the ones who did an extended fast end up lowering their metabolism and regaining all of the weight they had lost. The show The Biggest Losers is one famous and well studied example, But that's for CICO. Here are some anecdotal examples for extended fasting :


See : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1r8ffLDFcE

This is Dr. Stephen Phinney talking about exactly this thing.


See : Jimmy Moore (as a popular example) - After he fasted for 30 consecutive days, he regained almost all the weight he had lost.


See : https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1qfk3c/9_months_followup_after_30day_fast/

This is anecdotal example from this subreddit


See : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMpvC1Y2xA

This is a video about someone who happend to experience weight regain after fasting




The only singular positive documented and well studied example is this : http://pmj.bmj.com/content/49/569/203.full.pdf
But it's the only one I know about. It doesn't mean everyone would react to extended fasting like that.

This is very, very bad, We have almost no documented experiences in this subreddit for the good effects of extended fasting on weight loss long-term. And on the other hand, We have several people who regained their weight after fasting.

We really should write more long term follow ups and experiences and remind people of this more often. To those who fasted recently: Please set up an event in your calendar or gmail for one year from now in the future to remind yourself to go back to this subreddit and write about it. To those who fasted a long time ago (9+ months) but are still browsing this subreddit : We need your experiences. We need to know what you've been through. It's very important for everyone involved in here.

Have good new to share? There's a sub for that. 
Have political memes to share (that are not Q related)? There's a sub for that.

I realize a lot of topics fall under the Q umbrella. I also realize many of us are like minded and most of us will enjoy non-Q material, but this isn't the place. I have seen this happen on Facebook before. Groups/subs get big (good), focus gets blurry (bad).

Let's keep this a Q research sub! Please! If we get overwhelmed with other BS we won't be effective and will lose valuable member activity. This is too crucial to allow cludder muddy the water.

Your passion, your work, your organization, your talents… you made the right people take notice. So thank you. This victory belongs to all of you.

Eos causing this dump.,395,444,False,False,False,ethtrader,1527488018.0,True,"Disclaimer: My post is mostly speculation, but it is what I am observing. It may not be correct.

------------------

I believe Eos is dumping all of their coins on Bitfinex. If you look at this dump, ether is leading the way and Bitfinex is leading the charge. Bitfinex was trading $30 lower than any other exchange during todays dump (to a low of $492, other exchanges didn't fall below $510). EOS started transferring their Ether to Bitfinex about 3 weeks ago. They have transferred over 1m ether so far. There is only another 200k ether left in their crowdsale wallet. The date at which they transferred their ether to Bitfinex and when we started crashing line up almost perfectly.

You can see the outgoing TX's from the crowdsale wallet here: https://etherscan.io/txsinternal?zero=false&amp;a=0xd0a6e6c54dbc68db5db3a091b171a77407ff7ccf&amp;valid=true .

You can see the remaining funds in the crowdsale wallet here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xd0a6e6c54dbc68db5db3a091b171a77407ff7ccf

You can trace the eth spent (moved) by various ICO's here: https://sanbase-low.santiment.net/projects. EOS has moved 1.38m eth in the last month. All other ICO's combined have moved significantly less.

------------------

Once this wallet is empty the bear will likely be over. 20% of the funds remain in it. They will likely be dumped over the next few days as well. I would expect us to keep dipping for another few days before we bottom out and start heading back up again. Also, there are many users who want to get EOS for their mainnet launch. Once this occurs, ether will likely rebound hard.

According to Triumvirate propagandists, TEST’s absence was due to a mishap on the timer board. However, C0O6\-K is deep into Fraternity space. In fact, Legacy Coalition does not own any systems in Wicked Creek. Though this author is not a military expert, the significant distance between safe Legacy space and C0O suggests that mounting a defence fleet would have been potentially problematic. This challenge is only exacerbated by the fact that Legacy remains deployed in Providence. 

It may be the case that this action indicates growing tension between Triumvirate and Legacy. However, given the positioning of this Fortizar, it seems more likely that this is a normal defensive effort. 

**Mordus Angels Alliance Mothballed** 

Mordus Angels is an alliance living in Pure Blind and Fade, within Guardians of the Galaxy coalition. It has a long history of living in Pure Blind, particularly in the NPC system of 5ZXX\-K. From there, it spent many years fighting a guerrilla war against Goonswarm. After the eviction of Goonswarm from the North, it became a standard sov\-holding alliance within GOTG. 

However, in recent months, the Imperium has been conducting a hybrid campaign against GOTG. Goonswarm Special Interest Groups – a hybrid between expeditionary warfare unit and social club – assisted by the Initiative and Snuffed Out have put considerable pressure on GOTG. This has forced it to conduct a staged retreat from Pure Blind and Fade, to consolidate their forces in Deklein. 

This retreat has left Mordus Angels in a difficult position. With the alliance under increasing stress, the determination was made to mothball it. This is different from a failure cascade, as it is planned operation. Corporations are moving to various friendly entities. This author understands that a handful of alts will remain in Mordus Angels to preserve it. But the alliance, as an effective entity, is now defunct. 

**Guardians of the Galaxy Going Home; CO2 Moving to Reinforce**

Guardians of the Galaxy coalition has been deployed in the system of WLF\-D3 in Venal for the past week and a half. This action was taken to defend the region of Branch from the Imperium, which had changed the focus of some of their offensive effort. This is because Branch is home to GOTG renters and krabs.  

This deployment is now coming to an end. It appears that GOTG has decided, with the mothballing of Mordus Angels, that it is more important to secure Deklein than stop krab losses. Further, Imperium campaign commander Asher Elias has moved his force back to ROIR\-Y. This will resume his pressure on GOTG, in addition to ongoing efforts from Initiative. This makes any deployment away from defensive positions in Deklein and Fade problematic. 

In this redoubled security effort, GOTG has found allies in the form of Circle of Two. [CO2 has deployed their supercapital fleet to the GOTG staging Keepstar in DO6H\-Q, in Fade.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh1k0HPCPjQ&amp;t=6s) This is a precursor to a handover of Mordus Angels space in Fade to the alliance. CO2 contains numerous veteran PVPers. It is likely to increase GOTG combat capabilities in joint operations. 

Some have voiced concerns that CO2 is untrustworthy, having betrayed both Goonswarm and TEST in the past. These claims do seem credible based on past evidence, but the situation could develop in a number of different ways. 

**Tactical Supremacy Diplomatic Confusion in Providence** 

There has been a slight misunderstanding between pilots from Tactical Supremacy \(TIKLE\) and The Republic. The Republic. \(TR\) is a small alliance which has traditionally lived under the protection of Provibloc. Therefore, they are participating in the ongoing Reconquista of Providence alongside Legacy and Provibloc. 

Unfortunately, they have failed to understand that cooperation between Legacy and Provibloc does mean blue status. While most elements of Legacy have steered clear from deliberately attacking their Provi partners, TIKLE has opted not to do this. 

For the Psignosis, from The Republic., this was rather confusing. After being killed a few days ago by TIKLE pilot tovarich cookies, he decided to message his attacked to demand an explanation. [Discourse swiftly disintegrated as Psignosis became more agitated. ](https://pastebin.com/5VjZFe0h)

Though this is an isolated incident of limited consequence, it points to the broader issue of Legacy\-Provi cooperation. There is a perception within Provibloc that Legacy declined to support them in a time of need but are now happy to swoop in and steal outposts. While this is a reasonable geopolitical move by Legacy, it may spell discord down the road. That said, given the relative military prowess of the two coalitions, the threat may be minimal.

What is the deal with Jaqen H'ghar? (Spoilers Extended),33,62,False,False,False,asoiaf,1527525208.0,True,"So its heavily implied that Jaqen H'ghar is a Faceless Man who is on a mission in Westeros. That mission began with him purposefully getting hauled off to the Wall, but after meeting Arya and sending her to Bravos, he seems to have abandoned the wall and instead gone to Oldtown, where he is currently infiltrating the Citadel. 

The most common answers I have heard suggest he is on a complicated anti-dragon mission. Most likely looking for a book- perhaps ""Death of Dragons"" which we hear the only known copy exists at the Citadel. 

But it doesn't seem to add up, and I have some questions.

1) Jaqen begins his journey to the wall BEFORE Dany gives birth to dragons, and his change of plans in ACOK takes plays  before anyone in Westeros is aware of what has happened. Even if his turn to oldtown represents a change of plans, his original plan shouldn't have had anything to do with dragons- so what was it?    

2) During Arya's training, a big deal is made about how she must learn to kill ONLY the person who has been contracted to receive the gift. I'm going to say that nobody hired a faceless man to kill Pate the novice, and so Jaqen murdering and impersonating Pate seems like a violation of Faceless Bro Code (it obviously makes sense as a tactic, but it is the murder of someone not supposed to receive 'the gift', which seems like a big no-no)

3) Jaqen, when talking to Arya in Harrenhall, states that ""the Red God"" is owed three deaths. But again, we learn from Aryas ADWD chapters that the faceless men wouldn't see it that way- they worship the Many Faced God, not R'hllor. And while it is true that they say other gods are merely reflections of the Many Faced God, its odd that Jaqen would talk to Arya about R'hllor, as she has no experience with the Red God (we know that the FM think that ""The Stranger"" of the Faith of the Seven, is a representation of the Many Faced God, for example). 

4) Why did Jaqen use such a useless disguise in Westeros to begin with? Part of why the faceless men use their faceswapping skills is to go undetected or unnoticed. So it would make a lot more sense for Jaqen to have been wearing the face of some random Flea Bottom Hobo when we first see him, not the immediately distinctive face of a Lorathi - I believe to this moment he is the only character in the entire series we see from that Essosian city, and would have been immediately marked as a foreigner anywhere in Westeros. 

5)Why intentionally get himself in the black cells and into that cage at all? there are plenty of other NW recruits headed to the wall that aren't locked up, and if you can literally pretend to be anyone, why not just volunteer for the wall like a normal person? Why even bother going with Yoren, why not just hop on a ship headed to Eastwatch?

Anyways, just trying to make some sense of it all. Perhaps Jaqen is a rogue agent, much in the way that we expect Arya to abandon the faceless men after leveling up. But if so, why did he send her to them in the first place?

We need customizable pickup options! Create a menu with 'toggle buttons' and 'amount sliders' for every item. This way we can specifically say which items we want to auto-pickup and how many we want in our inventory before it gets disabled. I like using SMGs over ARs so I would prefer to have my auto-pickup options grab SMGs and ignore ARs and shotguns. The amount sliders could be useful because since I prefer SMGs I chew through a lot of ammo so the current limited auto-pickup does not grab enough when I'm looting.

This change could definetly make looting a lot easier so players who use auto-pickup aren't frustrated when they keep picking up stuff they don't need; And players who disable auto-pickup (like me) don't have to go through the slow process of picking everything up manually.

I hope this gets added :) "

He saw a squirrel. He jumped out the window. The forward momentum, and him getting caught in the partway open window, caused him to slide down the side of the truck and under the back wheel. My girlfriend, driving, screamed. We stopped the car. Tumbled out. It was too late.

"Debunked: ""Using Bitcoin (Cash) without a second layer is too inefficient, because the entire transaction history would have to be stored and synced by all of the nodes in the network. That would be like every user of email having to store every email that anyone had ever sent.""",81,134,False,False,False,btc,1527507852.0,True,"&gt;**Satoshi:**

&gt;Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. 

&gt;To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.

&gt;Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

&gt;A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. 

&gt;With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

&gt;It is hard to tease out which problem people care about, because most people haven't thought much about the block size and confuse the current pain of downloading the chain initially (pretty easily fixed by getting the current UTXO set from somebody), the current pain of dedicating tens of gigabytes of disk space to the chain (fixed by pruning old, spent blocks and transactions), and slow block propagation times (fixed by improving the code and p2p protocol).

Minor Monday #13: Hawaii,40,128,False,False,True,Kaiserreich,1527517679.0,True,"**Minor Monday 13 - Hawai’i**

Hello and welcome to another Minor Monday! It's time to talk about a country that will be coming alongside the US Rework and thus today we shall focus on Hawaii. All credit to Herkles here, enjoy!

Welcome to the tropical Island of Hawai’i. The islands are a territory of America since the annexation in 1898. However with the chaos coming in America, thanks to the civil war, things are going to change for the islands. 

https://i.imgur.com/qktCdNo.jpg

Shortly after the civil war begins the Island of Hawai’i will break off, declaring a state of emergency upon the island as they figure out their course of action. This Emergency Directorate is lead by James Dole who begins to plan an emergency meeting to decide the fate of the Islands.  Royalist see this as the opportunity to restore the Kingdom, while republicans see that we should forge a new path as an independent. 

Meanwhile in the sugarcane fields a strike is going on that is far larger than even the Oahu sugar strike of 1920. Many of these workers are looking at this chaos as a chance to demand better rights for the worker’s. Though at the same time a number are looking to forge a revolutionary commune where big five are utterly destroyed and the land is redistributed to the workers. 

Then there is the fact that some believe that Hawaii should remain as a territory of America, though which America is the question. However eventually a fate will need to be decided, and future of Hawai’i shall be decided.  

**The Kingdom of Hawai’i**

https://i.imgur.com/8y9Rla1.jpg

If the Kingdom of Hawai’i is chosen, then Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole will be crowned king. However, eventually he will die and thus a new king will be chosen. Following the customs of old, a Royal election will be held to determine exactly whom should be king or even queen. 

Their will also be new elections called for the Kuhina Nui or Prime Minister of Hawaii. As the Kingdom is a constitutional Monarchy. Moreover, the kingdom will need to work at bringing forth a new Hawaiian Renaissance of hawaiian Culture.

**The Republic of Hawaii**

https://i.imgur.com/CnWA8gM.jpg

If it is decided for Hawaii to be a Republic then there will be new Presidential Elections scheduled. The Republic path takes after the United States. Moreover it is the side that is most aligned with the Big Five, the colloquial name for the leading plantations on the islands. 

**The Commune of Hawai’i**

https://i.imgur.com/BJyQy7k.jpg

If the Revolution succeeds, then the Commune of Hawai’i shall be declared. The Commune is aligned to the International and the CSA on the Mainland of America. The Commune will attempt to transform the islands and bring about land reform to the people and destroy the old system of plantations. 

**The Economy of Hawai’i** 

https://i.imgur.com/GbuNkdg.jpg

Regardless of which future is chosen for Hawaii, the new country will need to modernize the country. Furthermore it will be wise to attract foreign investment to the islands to help build up the economy; whom you can ask to come and help you will be determined based on which path you go. 

**The Military of Hawai’i** 

https://i.imgur.com/AuypDCa.jpg

Regardless of which path is chosen for Hawaii the military will be decided. The Country as a small bunch of islands will mainly use its navy, most of which is left over from the United States. However, you will be able to seek out buyers for new ships to help improve the navy. You should also make sure not to neglect the army or the air force as well. 

**Foreign Politics**

Hawaii stands at the center of the Pacific Ocean and as such is in the cross hairs of main foreign powers, be it Japan or Canada and the Entente, or Germany or even the United States. To avoid being destroyed, the new country will need to make alliances. This will be handled by decisions and events. 

Also for those playing as one of the US countries, you will be able to reclaim Hawaii, should it break free. It will also be possible for Hawaii to become a state for the other US countries as well.  

This wraps up the coverage for this week's Minor Monday on Hawai'i. Join us next week as we go to New England and see what is going on in Boston. We'll see you all next week, but while you wait [check out our discord](https://discord.gg/013cqzfpWMRLqnvHr).

"Almost felt bad for ghosting her(1st time ghosting, long post)",47,98,False,False,False,TheRedPill,1527513197.0,True,"Hey guys before I start just want to say I am grateful I came across a site like this and the advice it has given me. I've only been here for a week or 2 I think, so I'm in no position to claim the following is an accurate assessment of things but It's the thought process I'm experiencing through the rage/depression/realization towards the nature of women. 

I posted in the asktrp section about a situation involving my GF chilling in the backseat with someone else and the response weren't what I wanted to hear so I tried to rationalize and give her the benefit of the doubt but turns out a week later the thoughts I didn't want to  entertain\(Like I had been told by many redpillers\) came around in a full circle.

Tbh it hurt like hell but nothing I can do about it now. I posted an update an the advice was the same as always, ghost. Which I have done so successfully\(so far\) but I'd be lying if I didn't say it's easy.  I have been HAMSTERING like crazy trying to give her the benefit of doubt cause it was a LDR so I couldn't know for sure right? I even started watching videos of if Ghosting is justifiable and I can't lie the womens response of it being ""immature"" ""selfish"" etc etc really got to me. I even did some research that said Ghosting could cause lasting effects of dealing with future issues for the person that ghost. Lastly I went full creep mode and caved slightly by checking her status on fb. Which where the predictable ""it takes a real man this"" ""real man that"" etc etc. 

At this point I starting to feel super bad and all bitch made with all this information about how ghosting doesn't make you ""a real man"" cause it selfish blah blah blah.  Even ball myself up like a bitch with a blanket on top hamstering away. Just before I decide I'm going to cave I call my Brother who was talking to me about it and 100&amp;#37; agreed with redpills solution. This is what my brother said ""Why do you care what people would think? It's natural you feel like this but don't let yourself get to a point where you giving her the benefit of the doubt. I mean it's not like she hid any of the things that gave you suspicions which should clearly tell you she doesn't even respect you enough to hide her cheating. If you confront her now, have a fight about it, chances are your reaction will somehow rationalize in her mind that her cheating was indeed justified...""  upon hearing that all these past memories flooded in and the rage just took over me. 

I never use to get girls in High school but as like some I'm one of those kids that peaked\(in looks\) after high school. I've had experience with girls but was always the guy on the side. It's the first time I've been the boyfriend and honestly if your not RP, more often that not your fucked\(cause she will cheat\).  

I can't for the life of me fathom how women can let guys they've only known for a week or 2 fuck them anyway they please yet withhold sex from their bf as if it's some prize or not like doggy or bjs because it's ""demeaning"" and then still have the nerve to post quotes about loyalty, men cheating and good women with captions like "" I deserve so much more"" or ""men are trash"". And the saddest part is It's not even the Instagram thots that i'm talking about it's just your average moderately dressed attractive girl.  It's not like I'm saying guys are not guilty of bad behavior but my god why are womens action always so unheard of in the mainstream media? 

I've even seen on my university confession page girls talking about how they crave a big dick but I thought size didn't matter? Or how they have a guy on the side who is just the right size and fucking them all the right ways yet they don't want to leave there BF because he is so loving and caring. I use to also agree with the whole don't bash women cause what if it was your daughter defense but then I got to thinking yes she might be your daughter but does that somehow give her some anti\-dick sucking forcefield? Honestly can't believe I was about to simp because of fake self\-righteousness.

Head is heated right now but I'm going to the gym today to start building myself up.

**TL, DR : Women responses on ghosting being selfish due to depriving them of closure made me feel bad that I was going to do the same to my ex but after talking to my Brother it made me realize that the same Women screaming about ghosters being selfish are the same women selfishly cheating on their BF yet parading as if they are the most loyal gf in the world.**"

I try to keep it as short as possible but there's a lot going on in my mind and I feel quite ashamed and here's the only place I feel I can talk about it.

We've been together for 8 years, married for 1.

About 2 years ago he started being passive aggressive, putting me down, letting his frustration out on me, blaming me that our relationship changed.

Since we started dating (mind you I was 21 back then) I did gain a little weight. About 15lbs (I'm quite tiny at 5.2). I've always been curvy but I'll admit that I have a small tummy but i don't feel like a whale or something.

Well last year he finally admitted that his behaviour towards me changed because of my weight. At first I was kinda annoyed to be honest (it's not like I'm letting myself go. I do get quite the compliments and being flirted to) but in January things escalated, we spilt for a week and sought counsellig afterwards.

Then we started going to the gym together, I started to eat healthier but not dieting or something (I'd just suffer from a Jojo effect and gain even more). So it's been a slow process but I'm working on it.
His behaviour didn't really change. Slightly less passive aggressiveness but he didn't really try to improve in our relationship.

Now to the other part:
He did and still does tell me that he's not attracted to be like he used to. But he still wants sex on a regular basis (5 times a week) and does not accept a ""no"" if I don't wanna. He guilts me into having sex, he gropes me (at home and in public) when I clearly state that I don't want that (he is quite rough), he negotiates sex or more like ""I brought you XY from store, you owe me"", and he doesn't accept my ""NOs"".
The way he initiates sex is by putting/forcing my hand on his penis or trying to ""playfully"" force my head to his penis. I often have to get rough or shout to get him to stop.

I honestly feel like shit because I know I'm just a ""means to an end"" especially if he told me like 2 days prior that I'm not attractive any more (or not as I used to be).

Last night he once again told me that he's unhappy that my progress regarding my body is too slow. Again the phrase: ""I need to be attracted to my partner"". And furthermore: ""if that progress is going so slow I don't know if our relationship can last..."".
I'm supportive, I'm not stupid, I'm quite funny, I'm interested in stuff he likes, I try to manage our lives (chores, shopping, organisational stuff) and my work, I'm self reliant and he can trust me. And all of this means nothing because I'm not losing these 15lbs quick enough...

I'm so ashamed that I'm being reduced to nothing but the one flaw. I'm ashamed that all he sees and seems to care about is having a little trophy wife for you-know-what. My self worth and esteem are pretty much non existent at that point.

I don't even know why I'm posting this here. I just needed to write it down I guess..."

Today marks a year that my older brother passed away and I’m still horrified thinking it was my fault,9,46,False,False,False,confession,1527526225.0,True,"He was only 18 when he passed away, I wish he was still here with me. He was overprotective of me, he always defended me, and he was my best friend. I remember he used to act funny and read me bed time stories almost every night, he always let me have money and he would do everything for me. He was handsome, smart, funny, cute, so he had everything going for him with school and all. I remember I would sneak into his room at night to cuddle with him because I would be really scared at night.

I really feel for his girlfriend. She is always depressed now, she really misses him and she always goes by his grave to cry. I am so frustrated and angry about it. He passed away right in front of my eyes and I at least have an old hoodies he always used to wear. This is hard to talk about but when he passed away, we were walking down to the store because I wanted to buy some junk food.We were walking and out of nowhere someone starts honking, then my brother threw me which I didn’t even see coming. Then I got up and he was on the floor with blood pourin out the back of his head. Apparently a drunk driver lost control and hit him. I freaked out screaming and crying and I turned him around trying to wake him up or at least get a response from him.

He didn’t wake up. When I saw his face his eyes were white and he seemed to have a seizure and I freaked out even more. I hugged him and didn’t want to let go then the police/girefighters/ambulance arrived and tons if people were there trying to take me off of him and help and I was terrified. 

After that my dad took me home. Things haven’t been the same since he left. I hear my mom cry in the shower at night, dad cried out of nowhere.  His room is silent. Sometimes I sit in his room, play his old favorite music (his favorite was the hotel california song) and do my homework in there to remember how things used to be. You guys might think this part is funny or that I’m mental, but sometimes at night I wear his hoddie and go to his room. Then I get a big pillow and sleep in his bed hugging it thinking like if he was still here. I’m sorry for this long read. I just don’t talk with friends or anybody else about it because I don’t want to be judged. This is my stupid fault, if only I didn’t want to go get food he probably would still be here with me today."

*MFA is a place for those who eat breathe and sleep the philosophy of their clothes*

*MFA is prescriptive if you want it*

*MFA is a doorway into event horizon of a new passion if you seek it*

*MFA is a place where advice is given by the inexperienced*

*MFA is a place where the inexperienced can become experienced*

*MFA is where you can find GAP and Rick Owens in the same thread and survive*

*MFA is where the same question gets asked 1,000 times over*

*MFA is where people discover something beautiful while others hate it*

*MFA is where those who don't care are extremely opinionated*

MFA might not be perfect.

MFA might not have the answer to every question.

MFA might dress too boring for some people.

MFA might dress too weird for some people.

But MFA has been through a lot and helped a lot of people out. 

MFA is hardly the only place to get advice, but I am very grateful for all of you and the time and effort that goes into contributing to keep this alive and going.

Then, if you go a specified amount of time without giving feedback (IE volume adjustment, or button click) then the ""protection mode"" activates. From then on, until you type in your secret password that you only get to set up on download, silent texts get sent out to people you've specified that you are in trouble and your location. Short of deleting the app, the only thing you can do to disarm it is type in the passcode.

There are ads, however you can disable them if it's messing with your app. I want people to be safe firstmost.

**Schedule:** I post on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

**Author's Note:** Welp, we made it to fifty. I know that we have had some rougher spots in the story, but I would like to thank everyone for keeping with me throughout this. I won't say I hope for another fifty, because honestly, the story will be over by then. I appreciate all of the criticism that I get every story, and I enjoy reading the comments to see if people can figure out where this is going, even if my method of storytelling is blunt enough that you can usually see what is coming from a mile away.

That's it. Enjoy the story.

&amp;nbsp;

This was not going to go well. Apparently, James had lost contact with Cassandra at some point, they were too early in their relationship to have the innate bond that they would eventually acquire, but they had set wards so that they could see how the other was doing. 

And now those wards were gone.

Not just James’ on her, but also hers on him. Which brought up a few terrifying options. One, she was dead, but James hadn’t gone berserk yet, so I was discounting that for the time being. Two, she had been cut off from her magic, which could happen multiple ways. One of those ways was if someone actually cut her off from the source permanently and so she had entirely lost the ability to do magic at all. Another was that someone had created a Jammer, which was almost equally scary. Jammers were extremely complex and took a very long time to make. Either James or I could make one with a little bit of effort, but for a normal elven mage to make one would take astronomical amounts of time and resources.

James stumbled to his feet and lurched in the direction of Pendros, staring off into the distance. He murmured something before bringing his hands up in front him and doing something I had never seen before.

I was somewhat like a portal, but you couldn’t travel through it and it was only one way. On the other side of the portal, I could see Cassandra standing, beaten but not broken. I also felt James’ mental state shake.

*Oh no.*

She was forced to the ground and I could feel the magic bleeding off of him, threatening to destroy the plateau that we were standing on and probably the area fifty miles around. I quickly weaved a containment spell around him to try and keep the power from running over, but it barely helped. His gift with gravity was starting to lift all of the rocks around him off of the ground.

I threw more power into the containment until it held all I could summon, but it still wasn’t enough. Where and the hell was this power during training? I looked back to the portal and almost completely lost the magic.

*How and the fuck did they get a subjugation band?*

Subjugation bands had been banned in draconic space for trillions of years, how and the hell did these elves manage to get one? They were almost impossible to manufacture, and the enchantment on them was one of the most complex the dragons had ever invented. Them making one was completely out of the question, so they must have found it, but where? They were banned long before this universe even came into existence! I was the only one allowed to interfere in their society, and I sure as hell didn’t give it to them.

When they began to put the band around her neck I knew we were fucked. I threw everything I had into the containment, but once that band closed it just blew away like dry leaves in the wind. I heard an audible click, and something fell into place in my head.

*Gods, he was already being dampened by himself. That was why he didn’t grow anymore, his body refused it. He was this strong without his full power?*

The moment the band closed James exploded in silver light, sending cracks spider-webbing through the entire plateau. All I could do now was watch, he was entirely beyond my ability to dampen let alone control.

Inside of the maelstrom of silver, I saw darkness spreading from his back. It extended out from his shoulder blades three meters in either direction.

That’s *what his wings look like?*

They were made of a deep black energy with silver dots of power peppering the entire wingspan. It looked like space on a very clear night, except there were more stars and the darkness seemed to consume the light they produced.

I had to completely shut off my telepathy now as I began to feel his rage spill over his walls. It was more intense than any I had felt before, I knew from his training that humans experienced emotions more vividly than dragons did, but I didn’t know that it was to this extent.

Once his wings were fully extended the silver magic vanished abruptly, leaving him standing there staring off towards Pendros. His wings beat once and he shot into the air, rocketing towards the city.

I sighed as I watched him go, and felt pity for whoever he was going towards.

On the other side of the Planet

&amp;nbps;

Kaela was out gathering herbs for her mother. The God had requested a special concoction that required herbs from very far and wide.

She had reached down to pick a Granth root when she felt something terrifying. Kaela had always been able to tell how people were feeling, the village elders had told her that it was a gift. But right now she didn’t think it was.

It was faint, but growing stronger with every minute. She didn’t know where it was coming from, it felt like everywhere at once, like it was bouncing around the planet and smashing into her. She knew that the stronger the emotion the longer the distance she could feel it from, but for someone to be this angry… it was scary.

She dropped the root and ran back to her mother, the emotion growing stronger and stronger every second.

She dropped to her knees in front of her mother crying, “They’re so angry, why are they so angry?”

Her mother looked at her questioningly, “What is wrong child?”

“My gift,” she said in between sobs, “I can feel someone, and they’re so angry.”

Her mother bent down and put her hands on the girl’s shoulders. “Where is it coming from dear?”

“Everywhere!”

Her mother froze, “Come, child, we must speak to the God.”

&amp;nbsp;

James

How dare they.

They would pay.

I didn’t have enough power for multiple long-range teleports, but I didn’t need them at the moment, my body had solved that problem for me. 

I shot towards Pendros, rage incarnate.

When I entered the city limits I flew to the dorm, slamming down in the backyard, throwing dirt and grass into the air. I forced it all back to the ground and stalked through the broken door.

The house was a mess, broken furniture and shards of stone were everywhere. There were also bodies, twenty-three of them if I had the right count, with at least fourteen bearing the signature of Cassandra's magic. I made a lot of noise when I slammed down in the yard, and Sara had been running to see what it was. When she saw me she stopped, staring.

I didn’t give her time to ask, “Where is she.”

“James you can’t be here! If the Lords--”

“Where is she, Sara.”

“James I can’t tell you--” Her words cut off when she saw my wings still extended behind me.

“Tell me Sara, or I’ll take what I need from you.” My voice was deadpan, the incandescent fury I was experiencing was overwhelming all of my other emotions.

She sighed heavily, “I don’t know, all I know is that the men were from Nero’s family. But James--”

I had already walked back to the yard, standing in the center. 

*I guess it’s the hard way then.*

I opened my telepathy as wide as I could, throwing all of my defenses to the side and stretching my mind as far as it could go. In an instant, I could feel all of the voices on the planet, but I pushed them to the side, only wanting to hear one. But I couldn’t find it.

I snarled and instead tried to focus on Nero, and I found him, almost instantly.

I turned towards him, spread my wings, and shot towards it.

Sara was left standing in the yard, her mouth hanging open at what I had become.

&amp;nbsp;

The flight was quick, I didn’t bother trying to see just where my limits ended, I just shoved them until they wouldn’t go any further. I broke the sound barrier almost immediately, breaking a few glasses in Pendros.

When I saw my target I dropped like a stone, smashing through the front gates like they weren’t even there. My wings folded themselves back behind me and I was sprinting towards the gate to the main building. There were guards shouting at me, but I dismissed them and they fell to the ground, unconscious. When I got to the door it exploded inwards, shards of wood and iron flying into the hall. I sprinted inside, sliding to a stop when I saw Nero standing there, a smug look on his face.

“Welcome James, we’ve--”

I teleported forward and grabbed his throat, lifting him into the air. I slammed my mind into his, not bothering with Io’s hard taught subtlety. I tore through his thoughts, finally finding what I needed. I threw Nero to the side and he flew through the air, smashing into the wall twenty meters away, cracking it with the force.

I extended my mind towards the location I had dug out of Nero’s mind, only finding one mind there. I wrapped it in magic and teleported it to me.

Cassandra landed in front of me, but it wasn’t her. I looked further into her mind and felt my heartbreak. Her mind was there, but it was shattered into a million pieces, each floating in nothingness.

I looked at the gleaming collar that she was wearing, feeling my rage get hotter.

It was all this thing’s fault. It had taken her from me.

I reached forward and grabbed it, power surging into my arms. I pulled from either side until I felt the metal give way and it split into two pieces. I growled at them, turning them to dust.

I looked back to Cassandra and felt my horror rise. Once I had removed the collar her hair had started to change. Starting at the roots her pure black hair began to turn white, creeping down until it had reached the tips. Once it was there her legs gave way, and I leaped forward to catch her.

I gathered her in my arms and looked at Nero, my anger still burning bright.

“I will be back for you.”

And I teleported us away.

&amp;nbsp;

We landed in her dorm room and I placed her on the bed. The rest of her room was trashed, but at least her bed was cleared. Once she was there I looked at her for a long moment, feeling my rage grow ever stronger.

I shook my head. *I can’t be angry for this. I need to be calm, devoid of all emotion.*

I reached into my mind without a second thought and activated a program that the Ambassadors had implanted into me. Immediately all of my emotions fled, locked away until I desired for them to come back.

I reached my mind out to Sara. *I am healing Cassandra. Let no one into her room and let no one know that I am here. I would have preferred to do this somewhere else, but this is where she feels most at home.*

With that, I waved my hand and the door suddenly had hundreds of protective enchantments over it.

I looked back at Cassandra and entered telepathy space. Looking further at her mind I could see that I was right, it had been shattered somehow. Doing a quick inventory I found that all of her memories were still there though, and it gave me some hope at least.

I sighed internally. I could fix her, but it would be a long and arduous process. I would need to put her back together, piece by piece, making no mistakes at all.

I shook myself, I wouldn’t make any mistakes, not with her.

I began.

&amp;nbsp;

Sara

&amp;nbsp;

“No! You are not allowed inside!” I was standing across the threshold of the dorm, staring down no less than three Lords.

“We need to enter, there was a reported disturbance of massive proportions. We need to know what it was.” That was the Lord Abjuration, who had detected something extremely fast fly over the walls and land in the yard of this dorm.

“I don’t care what was reported, we have just been attacked, I will not let more mages inside of this house until everything is set right and the perpetrators are found. Do you hear me?”

The Lord Combat stepped forward, “Sara, be reasonable please--”

“Reasonable? Oh, I am so far past reasonable. You idiots somehow managed to let an entire platoon of soldiers far enough into Pendros that they could attack us and kidnap our leader. Well *Lord Combat,* why didn’t you stop them? Or why didn’t the guard?”

He looked down at the ground, “We were unprepared, it had been so long since--”

“Do you think that makes me feel any better? They took her! Right under your nose! I know that you were unprepared, and until they are caught you are not allowed anywhere near here. Do you understand?”

“At least let us--”

*“Do you understand?”*

The Lord Combat stood there for a moment, “I do.” He turned to Abjuration and Elemental, “Let us leave for now. We will come back once the criminals are found.”

“You are going to let a little girl push you around? I think you’ve lost your touch Combat.” The Lord Elemental’s voice was scornful.

“Maybe I have.” the Lord Combat said quietly.

I watched them leave with no small amount of relief. James had been healing Cassandra for a week and a half now, but I couldn’t feel any magic coming from the room. All I could hear was James talking softly, sometimes in languages that weren’t Elven.

I shook my head, I didn’t know how long it would take for him to do what he was doing, but I could only keep him hidden for so long. Dalen had put wards and barriers all around Cassandra’s room that blocked anyone from sensing him, but he was still a fugitive in our house. Even if he was much stronger than he had been before, he was still only one mage, he couldn’t face the entirety of Pendros.

I sighed and walked back to the ‘command post,’ as Dalen had dubbed it. Really it was just the living room that we had all dragged our beds into so that we could be near each other. The attack had shaken all of us, even normally calm Esh had become enraged during the fight. Not that it helped much.

When it happened it happened fast, people smashed into the dorm and started trying to subdue us and take Cassandra. It was going horribly until one of them grabbed Cassandra and tried to drag her out of the house. Something snapped in her and she killed the man with magic. After that she was a storm of power, taking another ten soldiers down in the next few seconds, but then, all at once, it stopped. 

Her magic fizzled and she was overrun. She managed to land some hits on the faces of the soldiers, but it wasn’t enough. Our leader was taken from us.

Everyone blamed themselves, if they had been faster, or seen this coming, or had put more enchantments on the house. But in reality, there was nothing that we could have done, there were just too many of them. And then a few hours after it had happened James crashed down in the backyard, as intense as I had ever seen him, asking where she was. I had no idea how he knew that she was missing, but I tried to convince him not to go after her until we could gather more people. Of course, I couldn’t get a word in edgewise.

Then he left, as fast as he had come. About a half hour later he told me not to let anyone in the house and that he was healing Cassandra. The way that he told me still made me shiver, it wasn’t with words, he spoke directly into my mind.

James was a telepath.

And that scared me.

But he was our best hope, and I know that he would do everything in his power to save her.

Whether he would succeed or not… well, only the gods knew that.

But there are frequent posts on this subreddit where people see poor fish at a crappy store and want to rescue them. And it's completely understandable that you'd want to save a fish from that situation! It's hard not to feel something when you see sickly fish. But by buying the fish, you're just saying to the company that you'll continue to support the bad conditions, and they'll have no incentive to improve things. You're voting with your money. 

Here's an article that expands on this: http://www.anapsid.org/pettrade/petstorerescues.html 

It's about reptiles, but the principles are the same. 

Instead of buying the fish, consider writing to management or a local authority about the conditions. Boycott bad stores and spend your money somewhere decent. Post pictures of the bad conditions on social media and tag the store. Thanks."

""Yeah they are all mine,"" the flustered mother sighs, having heard that

question a thousand times before.

She says, ""Sit down Terry."" All the children rush to find seats.

""Well,"" says the social worker, ""then you must be here to sign up. I'll

need all your children's names.""

""This one's my oldest - he is Terry.""

""OK, and who's next?""

""Well, this one he is Terry, also.""

The social worker raises an eyebrow but continues. One by one, through the

oldest four, all boys, all named Terry.

Then she is introduced to the eldest girl, named Terri.

""All right,"" says the caseworker. ""I'm seeing a pattern here. Are they ALL

named Terri?""

Their Mother replied, ""Well, yes-it makes it easier. When it is time to get

them out of bed and ready for school, I yell, 'Terry!' An' when it's time

An' if I need to stop the kid who's running into the street, I just yell

""Terry"" and all of them stop. It's the smartest idea I ever had, namin'

them all Terry.""

The social worker thinks this over for a bit, then wrinkles her forehead

and says tentatively, ""But what if you just want ONE kid to come, and not

the whole bunch?""

""I call them by their last names!"""

I know I'm late to the party, but I downloaded Pokemon Go recently (to motivate myself to get off the couch) and completely fell in love. I've been going for daily walks, catching Pokemon and most recently discovered a gym nearby my house. So this morning, I woke up at 6:00 a.m., walked my ass to the gym and annihilated three other Pokemon to claim it as my own. Feeling pretty great right now.

Anyway, I don't really have anyone to share this with, so I thought you all might appreciate my first victory.

1.	He pointed out how Dhoni played Watson purely as a batsman after his first century. Called out how well CSK managed their players.
2.	How Kane was having every fielder in their position ready to go during the DRS calls. Zaheer pointed out the new batsman will have very little time to adjust if the calls goes SRH way. Those little things make Kane a great captain.
3.	The first game. Fizz bowling with fine log up during the last over. Kedar, with his injured hamstring, had extremely few shots to play and having third man up made it easy for him. Harsha reminded the viewers that Zaheer said this before the start of that 20th over, not after the fact.
4.	How high tide in Mumbai makes the ball swing in Wankhede Stadium.
5.	CSK vs SRH - Qualifier 1 - His explanation of how using a high roller can sometimes have an opposite effect. In fact, his guess was confirmed by Sanju at the ground.

It was a pleasure. You can see why Zaheer was one of the most respected bowlers around. Hope there is more to come."

I heard him talking to one of his friends who asked where we were registered, I said Target &amp; Amazon. Our Amazon registry is most of the big ticket stuff like car seat / stroller / swing / pack n' play, but I did register at Target for specific things I didn't want from Amazon. I saw reviews that said Amazon ships counterfeit pampers, their Sophie the Giraffe isn't an authentic Sophie. I did all of our diapers, sophie, medicine, her bathtub/bathing stuff, some outfits, some books, a Graco Glider &amp; her dresser on a Target registry. I was honestly going to be happy if one of his bachelor friends snagged us a pack of diapers or a nose frieda. He called back and said I bought everything @ Target, you need to add more stuff!!! :O :O :O That is such a huge relief to me that out of 139 things I registered for, 40 of them were immediately taken care of. I have a fetal echocardiogram on Wednesday that is going to cost us over $1000+ and money has been STRESSING ME OUT. It was just such a sweet thing and I am still in shock that someone would buy everything!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Thank you, bachelor friend with no children!! "

[Strategy] Just what exactly is a win condition? A guide to help you rethink what you thought you knew about Clash Royale.,56,105,False,False,False,ClashRoyale,1527514843.0,True,"The purpose of this guide is to correct the flaw that many players in Clash Royale currently have, which is believing that a card is a win condition.

Let's get this out of the way first. No single card is a ""win condition."" A win condition is the series of steps that you plan to take in order to win the game.

Take three musketeers for example. Your win condition is not the three musketeers, but rather to overwhelm your opponent with elixir advantages and strong dual lane attacks.

Calling cards a win condition like this is a bad habit to get into, and it's part of the reason why this community is pretty toxic.

Instead of people realizing that either they failed to properly execute their win condition, or that their opponent prevented them from executing their win condition, instead people just say they got countered. This leads to toxic behavior, as people are not accepting their own mistakes. Sure, there are matches where you just cannot win, because your opponent overwhelms you with overleveled cards, but that is not getting countered.

The goal of the game is to execute your win condition while preventing your opponent from executing theirs.

An example is people saying that PEKKA counters Golem. Sure, PEKKA is a card that can put in work against a Golem, but if you are a Golem or a PEKKA player, you should know, from experience, that PEKKA decks do not innately counter Golem decks.

Why is this, if PEKKA counters Golem? It is because Golem is not the win condition for Golem decks.

The win condition for Golem decks is to gain an elixir advantage by using their towers health as a resource to eliminate elixir that the opponent has spent, utilizing the Elixir Collector properly, or a combination of both, and to build a massive push with that advantage.

When you are building your deck, instead of focusing on a card as a win condition, focus on an idea. Do you want to win by building massive pushes? Do you want to win by denying your opponent an opportunity to set up their win condition? 

I know many of you are familiar with the Control/Beatdown/Siege archetype triangle. If you are following what I'm saying so far, then you should realize that sitting above that, are two different ~~archetypes~~ ideas for you to consider while playing. Denial and Execution.

~~A denial deck is a deck~~ The idea of denial, is the idea that is focused on denying your opponent the opportunity to set up their win condition. High pressure decks are a good example of ~~this~~ a deck that strongly relies on this idea. Triple spell decks are also an example of this. These two deck types, when played properly, allow you to deny your opponent the opportunity to set up their win condition by forcing them to spend elixir, or by providing an additional counter to your opponents troops that they will have a hard time dealing with. ~~Denial decks~~ The idea of denial is not limited to these archetypes. I have just listed them as an example.

~~Execution decks are decks are all about executing their win condition.~~ The idea of Execution is the idea in which a player relies strongly on setting up their win condition at all costs. Classic Golem beatdown is the perfect example of ~~this~~ a deck that relies heavily on execution. ~~These decks~~ This idea will always win the game if they are allowed to execute their win condition, and their player executes it properly.

No deck is strictly limited to these ideas, as people have mentioned in the comments. 

Neither of these two ~~archetypes~~ ideas directly counter the other. In a head to head matchup, ~~the~~ Denial ~~deck~~ will win if they do not allow ~~the~~ Execution ~~deck~~ to perform their win condition. ~~The~~ Execution ~~deck~~ will win if they are able to pull off their win condition successfully and properly. When ~~a~~ the Denial ~~deck~~ idea faces another player utilizing the Denial ~~deck~~ idea, the player that is better able to disrupt their opponent will win. When two players with Execution ~~decks~~ ideas face off, ~~the player who is first able to properly execute their win condition will win.~~ the winning player will be the player who properly executes the Denial idea on their opponent.

If you take this guide into account, you will find yourself winning more games. You will begin to realize if your opponent is ~~playing a~~ using Denial or Execution style ~~deck~~ tactics, and adapt your game plan to defeat them.

If anyone has any questions or feedback, I will be around to answer them for a while.

Edit: I have updated the terminology of this post based on feedback that I have received from several insightful commenters. I had originally used language that poorly reflected the message that I was trying to convey. I hope that this makes everything easier to understand."

Just give me the doctor's note!,1,61,False,False,False,MaliciousCompliance,1527534544.0,True,"Decades ago, I had a boss who was a bit of jerk.  Everyone ended up quitting on him eventually, and this is one example why.  I had put in a request for a 2-day vacation a month beforehand to attend an anime convention - a Thursday and a Friday, with the following Monday being a holiday where everyone was off.  It was the first time I had asked for any sort of time off (vaca, sick, personal, etc.) in my year of working there.  And I only felt good about asking for the time off because my IT department was finally fully staffed, so the work of 3 people I had been doing by myself for most of that year was now spread out between me and 2 other guys.  



So the convention goes off without a hitch, but I sadly get some con crud.  Not wanting to get the other 2 guys sick, I called out sick for 1 day.  The boss goes off.  He demands a doctor's note, because now I have been gone 5 days, and HR regulations demand that I have a doctor's note to justify sick time for 3 days or more.  But technically, of course, I've only had 1 sick day off, so I read up the employee handbook, and sure enough, it's *3 working days* or more of calling in sick.  Again, I haven't taken any time off for the past year, worked OT without pay (exempt employee) by myself for most of the past year, and he is questioning my credibility.  Still, wanting to show that I am a good employee (how naive I was), I go to the doctor's office to show that I am not ""faking it.""  


The doctor says I have a cold, and I ask him if I'm contagious at this point, and he said, ""You shouldn't be after today, but you should rest at least a week to get your strength back up.""  The doctor then gives me a note saying I should be out for one week.  I then call back my boss giving wanting to give him the good news that I won't be contagious the next day so I'm thinking of coming in if I am feeling better.  Unfortunately for him, the only thing he wanted to hear was if I had gotten a doctor's note (and yes, I'm feeling like a juvenile delinquent, whereas I am a grown man).  I told him yes, and before I could tell him I'll no longer be contagious the next day, he demands, ""Just give me the doctor's note!""  He slams down the phone in my ear, so I fax the doctor's note to him (again, about 20 years ago - but I was cool enough to have my own fax machine).  So instead of showing up the next day, I stay home and show up a week later, all paid sick leave.  Yes, the boss was steamed after that, and I quit a couple of months after that because I couldn't stand it anymore.  The other 2 left soon thereafter (the last one called me after he quit, and laughed, ""I'm free!!!!"") and my boss was let go for not being able to keep the IT support positions staffed."

I’m a newly trained receptionist in a large, french hostel. I can literally watch myself become more cynical as I see how guests play the system.

This story spans over several days and I will refer to the crazy, entitled guest will be CG

While I was helping another guest, CG barged into the reception soaking wet and in a towel.
Apparently the water had been turned off in the whole building due to a leak and flooding room. I didn’t know this at first but maintenance came down to tell me just as the woman was yelling at me. I could understand her frustration but I clearly had no idea what had happened. While I’m speaking in french to the maintenance man, in order to convey the issue, CG pokes me on he arm and looks at me waving her hands like “how dare you speak a different language in front of me?” Babe, you’re in France. Sent her to our communal showers connected to a different water system.

CG comes back down to the reception hours later and I’m still there. She wants to know how much it would cost her to extend her booking over the weekend? Can she get a discount for the inconvenience? Okay, sure we will give you a 15% discount. She doesn’t think it’s enough and asks for more, I refuse and she books it anyway. She rebooks. Also asks about catching a bus to go to another town for the day but she doesn’t have time so can we look it up and write it all down in her notes. Ok, not something I would do for most guests but said okay to make her feel better about her experience. She never comes back for the info.

She comes back on the second night of her booking extension and starts raising her voice at the other receptionists claiming that one of the housekeepers moved her stuff. She’s sleeping in a dorm. We certainly would not touch anyone’s stuff if it’s contained to a bed. Could have been a guest or she could be lying. She DEMANDEDa refund and would not leave the reception. She was kicking up a fuss and was making a scene. The manager approved a refund for some reason, even though she did not deserve it...

... and then she had the AUDACITY to ask for directions to the airport.

Bitch mistakenly booked a day too long and then realised her flight was on a day she had already booked to sleep somewhere. So she though she deserved to have her cash back for that. 

Imagine doing this your whole way across Europe."

He said in his post it was a transaction from october 10. All the other sold louis vuitton stussy t shirts were from 10 months- 1 year so only one option left was this one from 8 months ago (top left corner) which is october from today.

These people are idealistic, mostly libertarian, first adopters who believe in free speech, freedom of association and the free market. r/btc was created to allow free speech about bitcoin. Of course it mostly contained big blockers.

When bitcoin cash was created it found a fertile home here. We are the real bitcoiners. Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin. It was r/bitcoin that alienated us, not the reverse. They can have r/btc as that is their ticker symbol, if they give us r/bitcoin as that is our project."

My Parents made a sex tape,24,179,True,False,False,nosleep,1527511751.0,True,"I hate myself. 

I hate what I saw and I hate that I can't tell anyone else about it. 

That's probably why I'm writing this now, trying to get it out there. At least on the internet you have some anonymity. 
I mean, who wants to really confess something like this anyway? 
First of all, if you were tell me that my 50 year old parents were passionate in their love life a week ago I would probably have laughed so hard that I would be in tears. 

I was raised in a very traditional Christian family, that meant modest clothing and no cussing unless you wanted to get your mouth rinsed with soap. For my three brothers and I that meant we had to learn about sex the old fashioned way with porno magazines and internet searches. 

I'm barely 17 now, so don't judge me just because I have urges. I get enough flack from my parents as it is; and now with what I do know about them I can't help but feel that they are nothing but a  pair of liars. In fact I'm not sure what to make of it. 

It started at a small adult store just off the highway near the town I live in. When I turned 16 I probably frequented that place more often than the study hall. 

Nick, the guy running the store; was really dope, he would let me come in and take whatever I wanted as long as I brought him a few packs of weed from school as an even trade. I never smoked the stuff but my older brother keeps a stash in the basement. 

Anyway, I would usually stop by the store on a Saturday to find some of my favorite pornos and get a few magazines, and then drive home right around the time that dad was heading for work.  

Another reason I doubted my parents ever cared about each other is because they had different schedules. Mom works in the day and dad goes to clean floors at night, so that means they barely have any time together. 

So I fell into a routine of waiting for Mom to go to sleep and then sneaking to the car to grab the porn from under my spare tire in the trunk. I would quietly go into my bedroom, lock the door and jack off to my heart's content. 

That remained the same until a week ago. 

Nick told me that he was starting to get a few bootlegged copies of porn that was never meant to be released in the United States, like extremely edgy BDSM and weird fetish stuff. 

I hate to admit it but after watching probably millions of hours of blowjobs and anal, I was growing tired of traditional porn so I asked him to let me see one of them. 

The first problem I ran into was that the movies were on old school VHS, and Nick admitted he had no idea if any of them would even work or not. 

But since I was continuously supplying his pot he let me try one out for free. 

My dad keeps an old VCR, for the days when he feels like watching a classic John Wayne flick that doesn't show on TCM or the Trials of Life series. 

It took me a day to find it though as he had stashed it away in the attic, but I made an excuse to Mom that I wanted to help Chad my middle sibling with some of his chores. 

The VCR looked to be about as old as my parents were, but I had a feeling it would do the trick. Again I waited until only a few nights ago, on Saturday; to watch. 

I inserted the tape and got myself ready for some messed up shit, but nothing prepared me for what I did see. 

It started out like most pornos from the 90s do, with a weirdly dressed female walking down the street as though lost. 
She was wearing a strange mask over her face, like the kind you use for a masquerade ball; so I couldn't say for certain what she looked like. 

The feed cut to a house where a man was waiting, he was wearing what appeared to be an executioner outfit and I almost laughed. Apparently I had stumbled on a poor man's attempt at BDSM. The laughter died about a minute later when the woman took off the mask and I found myself looking at a younger version of my mother. 

I froze as the video continued and she started to do a lap dance for the weird executioner dude. I didn't know whether to turn it off or not, because I was so stunned by what I was seeing. 
It was like I couldn't move. She was touching his shoulders and then took off his mask and I about vomited when I realized it was my dad. 

I got up to to turn off the tape when they started talking to each other, saying dirty things in the recording. They sounded so different than any words I had ever heard my parents use. 

""Fuck me like the whore I am!"" my mother screamed. 
""You'll take it like a little bitch,"" my father said as he slapped her down. 

They both sounded distressed. The lighting in the movie was beginning to falter as they continued with the roleplay but as I watched my mother's expression I realized it seemed like they were being forced to do this for someone else. 

Dad's face was a mixture of pain and torment as he tied my mom naked to a bed and then I covered my face as he took out his dick and began to masturbate. He was holding a camera over his head while he did it. It was like he was filming it for another video. 

I felt wrong in a way I can never possibly describe and I reached to pull the tape out. Then something else happened that I didn't anticipate. 

I heard my dad talk on screen as though he were desperate to make this stop. 
""We've done everything you asked us to,"" he said. His voice was shaky. 
I heard a low rustling noise from somewhere on camera and then the screen went black. 

My heart started racing a thousand times faster as I heard screams an shrieks like nothing I had ever heard before in my life. I turned the volume down in case it woke up anyone else in the house but still the way they were screaming it sounded like something was attacking them. 

Inbetween the noises, the lights flickered off and on and I caught glimpses of something moving, another figure in the room. Long gashes were being made on my father's chest and across my mother's arms. Blood spattered the camera as more screams echoed in the room. 

Then silence. I moved toward the VCR again, assuming that I had seen the end of the tape but again as I was about to pop it out the image distorted and came back. 

This time I was staring at two bloated and decaying corpses, my parents bodies were ripped limb from limb with their vital organs dangling from the bedposts and blood and semen smearing the entire bed. 

Something in the dark moved again, it was like a black oily substance covering the floor. It spread across the open cavity of my mother first. Her body writhed and shook as her eyes rolled back. Then the shadow lingered near the foot of the bed and formed to fit the face and structure of my father. 

I stared wide eyed and shook with fear as the strange newly formed doppelgängers moved toward the camera, as though looking straight on at me and then cut off the feed. 


That was two nights ago. I went back to Nick's last night to return the tape. 
""Did you like it?"" he asked. 
""I don't ever want to see anything like that again,"" I told him bluntly. I probably looked as white as a sheet. 

""Oh that's too bad,"" Nick said as he took it from me and added, ""I meant to tell you last time you were here that all the other older tapes came from the same place. Guess they are part of a series or something.""

I took one look at the pile of tapes he had behind the counter and ran out of there. I haven't been home since. I don't know if I'm ever going back. 

One thing is for sure though, I have sworn off [porn](https://m.facebook.com/Kyle-Harrison-2120650624830271/) for good.

Found my girlfriends suicide notes,9,42,False,False,False,relationship_advice,1527532267.0,True,"I (F20) am home alone today and doing some spring cleaning stumbled upon a black notebook. Wondering what it was I opened it and found that it belongs to my girlfriend (F20) who I have been dating and living with for almost 2 years now. Typically, I wouldn’t continue reading a notebook I presume is her journal but I saw a letter with my name on it. The letter is a suicide note. There’s multiple ones, all written one day last week when I was out of town for a cousin’s graduation party. My girlfriend wrote about 10 notes, all to different people explaining her feelings for them and telling them not to forget her when she dies. 

What do I do? I feel like this must be some sick joke. My girlfriend has had issues with depression before and I have always been able to help her out of each episode. She’s gotten so much stronger lately and I thought she was doing much better. Finding these has hit me like a ton of bricks and I don’t know how to approach her about it because I’m not sure how she’ll react knowing I found and read them. 

Please advise me here. I’m so lost and scared and not sure how to handle this. 

Edit: I re-read the letters and wasn’t so in shock this time so I was able to pay attention better and get more details. This wasn’t a one time depressive episode. The letters date back to 5 days ago, she talks about actually taking pills in her last letter and it’s clear that she really did try to commit suicide. Our best friend is coming over now to help me prepare for talking to her and we’re going to confront her tonight and see what we can do about getting her help. Thank you for the advice so far, I’d love any more resources or advice you guys have to offer. You’ve been so helpful, thank you. "

The OG OC,75,46,False,False,False,BravoRealHousewives,1527527828.0,True,"Season one of RHOC is on Bravo right now.  I've been watching since the beginning and seeing these episodes reminds me why I got into the show in the first place.  The on the spot talking heads - there was just a random one with Michael's (Vicki's son) friend in front of the house before going on a trip with Vicki's family.  Vicki's original face (she was cute!).  The taglines taken from a sound byte during the season (""Are the cops involved?).  And forget about this ridiculous Slade and Jo dynamic.  He is so awful right from the beginning.

The show is way less produced, more natural and all about the families.  The kids are spoiled, yes, but they're also just kids being kids.  Vicki is uptight but not insufferable like she is now.  And I do love me some Donn.

Anyone else watching today?  What do you love/hate about where it all began?"

Silicon Lottery now accepts Nano as the sole Crypto payment option!,2,28,False,False,False,nanocurrency,1527538400.0,True,"Those who are computer hardware enthusiasts may know about us, but we're a Texas company that sells binned and delidded computer processors. For CPUs that are able to be overclocked, we effectively take the ""silicon lottery"" out of the equation by selling processors by their overclocking capabilities. This is a premium service for those looking to get every last inch of performance.

From day one when we started this business four years ago, we accepted Bitcoin as a payment option through Coinbase. December of last year was a bad time for us, as we had several orders placed in Bitcoin that took even up to a week to confirm. It was a pain to manage refunds for the Bitcoin payments that took too long to confirm. What used to be a clean and simple process became a mess. We temporarily stopped accepting Bitcoin for about a month until things settled down.

Fast forward to this month, we took some time to research all the different cryptocurrencies that have come about over the years. Out of everything we looked at we determined Nano made the most sense for our use case. Instant transaction confirmations with high throughput and zero payment fees. Simple and easy.

The fact that Nano isn't a mining crypto is also a big plus. The GPU shortage this past year has been directly hard on our own customers, inflating the cost of building PCs. In a way, supporting cryptocurrencies that require mining is against our own best interest.

Thanks to BrainBlocks, we were able to easily integrate Nano payments through our Shopify store. We're not going to accept any other cryptos as a payment method at this point because it's simpler for our own bookkeeping purposes (zero transaction fees for moving crypto around is also an understated benefit for bookkeeping) and it should be simple enough for other crypto holders to convert to Nano first if they need to.

Really tired of the BBC anti-catholic bias.,21,58,False,False,False,Catholicism,1527523332.0,True,"We seen it just a few day’s ago when they questioned Catholic Jacob-Rees Mogg about his religious views and whether they would get in the way of him becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but I see underlying, not so obvious anti-catholic bias in their everyday reports. The BBC are compelled by UK Law to remain anti-bias as they are funded by the government, however various reports during the lead up to the Irish abortion vote seemed to praise Yes campaigners and urge the youth to make a change to the traditional Catholic Ireland. 

One of the Bishop’s in the UK, Bishop John Keenan of Paisley, stood up for Catholic’s when they questioned Rees-Mogg on his religious views. He also criticised a BBC Scotland video which was aimed towards young adults, in which a man dressed as a priest hands a piece of cheddar cheese to a woman (a parody of the host) at which point the narrator says that Jesus “saved a lot of time when he died for our crimes, that he would’ve wasted teaching small minds that love is no sin”. The narrator then looks at a priest and says, “See him, he think’s it’s faith. But under all that, it tastes like cardboard and smells like hate.”

I’m appalled by the anti-catholic rhetoric in the BBC. We see it in all media, but it’s at its worst there. I’d also like to take this opportunity to ask you to pray that Bishop John Keenan becomes the new Cardinal for Scotland, as our former cardinal was stripped of priestly duties after sexual allegations emerged in 2013 (and he died a month or so ago). As someone who has met Bishop John Keenan multiple times, I’d say that he stands up for the rights of all Catholics across the Globe - and would make a fitting Cardinal when the time comes for the Holy Father to choose one."

How do I gently ask her to stop fondling me?,30,75,False,False,False,gaybros,1527516303.0,True,"So I've been working at this new place for about half a year now, and I've gotten to be good friends with a lot of them, and hang out sometimes after work. There's this girl, awesome woman, very headstrong, funny, and very lickable, but I'm kind of having an issue with her. She's pretty handsy with me a good few times when we're out socialising in pubs and clubs and whatever. Sort of into groping me, especially when I'm not expecting it, like a pinch of my ass or whatever. She's well aware that I'm gay, so it's not like she's flirting with me, it seems more like she's just enjoying my reaction. She finds it funny, but honestly, I'm not having fun.

I didn't want to make a big deal out of it and just tolerated it in the beginning, I didn't want to come across as a hypersensitive jerk, you know? But over time she's been pushing the boundaries and the last night we were out she put her hands on my groin. I took her hand away and she teased me about it. I'm kind of working with issues around a sexual assault that occurred years ago, so, her putting her hands on me like that was, (for lack of a better term..) triggering. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to bring it up to her that I'd rather she didn't do that anymore? Maybe someone here has gone through something similar? I mean, it's sorta my fault for not telling her in the first place, and now it's been a couple of months since it first started so it feels really awkward to bring it up now. She's my team leader as well which adds extra awkwardness. 
I don't wanna cause drama or lose friendships over this, I just want boundaries. "

I was in my bedroom, but had not gone to bed yet when I heard him barking from the kitchen. 
This was not his typical playful bark, or even his there’s-people-walking-by-outside bark. This was a I-feel-threatened/something-is-really-wrong bark. First I thought it was maybe an animal, so I opened the patio door thinking he’d chase it off. He ran towards the backyard briefly, then quickly came back and was sniffing at the wooden fence like there was someone on the other side (the same way he did when there were squatters there, before the house was torn down. It’s now an empty lot). 
At this point, I knew something was really wrong and called him back inside. I gave him a treat for being a good guard dog and then thought to go double check the front door was deadbolted. This is when I heard someone right outside my front door. 
When I was off the phone with the police dispatch, I heard a car drive off. He definitely scared them off. Lots of treats and belly rubs for my boy, who is usually a bit of a trouble maker.

Ruth xx

Hi there! I’m Ruth Marshall and I wrote a book about forgetting how to walk after having a tumor (spinal meningioma) removed from my spine.  Also, I do voiceovers for commercials.  And I used to be an actor on shows like Degrassi where I was the super-popular character Clare Edwards’ mom, and on Doc where I was Billy Ray Cyrus’s boss and when we were in scenes together, I looked so tiny standing next to him he looked as if he might eat me for a light snack.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw_KBYwCgj4 (~6:00 mark)

You can ask me anything about writing books, doing voice overs, dealing with nerve confusion, forgetting then remembering what my feet are used for, being a mom, why I wish I never had to wear pants again, what other famous people had my kind of tumor, what kind of books I read/avoid, anything!

There are still supers that could take it out \(Nova, and Golden Gun\).  But you can't just enter and kill everything with a roaming super.  It still leaves the bubble with a good use, but doesn't cause anyone to have an advantage over anyone else.

Thoughts?

Deadbeat brother in law,22,95,False,False,False,legaladvice,1527515139.0,True,"In Florida. My wife, our two small children, and my wife's brother were broadsided when someone ran a red light and hit them while driving through an intersection.  My wife is the most injured (not getting into the specific injuries of everyone). My brother in law does not appear to be all that hurt but he's really playing it up. I am worried that he is going to take settlement funds away from my family. He has no car, works at a carwash for minimum wage, no auto insurance (obviously with no car), lives in an apartment with 4 other people so basically has very minimal expenses. He is treating it like he hit the lottery. Meanwhile my wife is in a lot of pain, it's putting stress on our family trying to find babysitters etc so I can continue to go to work during the day. 

Should we be using a separate lawyer than her brother? If a settlement is reached I believe the funds come from one source so we will need to split it. How is it typically split? 

Separate question: should we attempt to negotiate down the lawyer fee?  I assume this should be an easy case seeing that my family was simply driving through a green light and another person ran the red light without even applying the brakes. There are multiple witnesses on the police report. 

Thanks

Anecdotal evidence the work is slowing.,17,131,False,False,False,exmormon,1527519816.0,True,"I was at a family gathering last night and spent a few minutes talking to my uncle, who is a temple worker at one of the Utah houses of handshakes, and he mentioned how wonderful his shift on Saturday had been.  It was so busy!  He said that during the week there's nothing for him to do.  Most sessions during the week have less than 20 people in them, he then excitedly told me how many weddings there had been on Saturday.

From this discussion I am guessing 3 things.

1). The church has way too much capacity for endowments in Utah. Especially during the weekday.

2).  Temple weddings are probably the largest social virtue signal in the church. 

3).  I compared the number of marriages my uncle stated against the capacity of large sealing rooms that could accommodate the virtue signaling of a temple marriage and found that even with his great enthusiasm, they only used half the capacity on what should have been an at capacity weekend. 

It's anecdotal, but the work is slowing heathens."

Two couples were playing poker one evening.,12,238,False,False,False,Jokes,1527516148.0,True,"Dave accidentally dropped some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed Frank's wife, Sue wasn't wearing any underwear under her dress! Shocked by this, Dave upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table and emerged red-faced.

Later, Dave went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Frank's wife followed and asked, 'Did you see anything that you like under there?' Surprised by her boldness, Dave admitted that, well indeed he did.

She said, 'Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500. 'After taking a minute or two to assess the financial and moral costs of this offer, Dave confirms that he is interested.

Sue told him that since her husband Frank worked Friday afternoons and Dave didn't, Dave should be at her house around 2 p.m. Friday afternoon.

When Friday rolled around, Dave showed up at Frank's house at 2 p.m. sharp - and after paying Sue the agreed sum of $500 - they went to the bedroom and closed their transaction, as agreed.

Dave quickly dressed and left. As usual, Frank came home from work at 6 p.m. And upon arriving, asked his wife: 'Did Dave come by the house this afternoon?'

With a lump in her throat Sue answered 'Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon.'

Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, 'And did he give you $500?'

Sue, using her best poker face, replied, 'Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500.'

Frank, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying, 'He came by the office this morning and borrowed $500 from me. He promised he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home and pay me back.'"

"O governo Temer: incompetente, corrupto e arrogante.",86,194,False,False,False,brasil,1527510282.0,True,"Entrei no Reddit em 2011, durante a adolescência. Na época, estava no ensino médio e o r/brasil tinha uns 400 inscritos, sendo limitado a posts de notícias em português. Em meados de 2015, após cursar Direito por um ano e iniciar o tratamento do meu TDAH, o tom das minhas postagens e comentários mudou bastante, abordando muito mais temas jurídicos do que qualquer outra coisa. Mesmo meus posts sobre [Getúlio Vargas](https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/7qbj6d/me_assusta_o_amor_que_muita_gente_tem_por_get%C3%BAlio/) e a [“intervenção militar”](https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/8m9mpd/interven%C3%A7%C3%A3o_militar_constitucional_n%C3%A3o_existe/) tiveram uma ênfase mais jurídica que histórica ou política.

Destaco isso inicialmente apenas porque essa é minha primeira publicação no subreddit com ênfase quase exclusivamente política. Resolvi fazer isso porque preciso muito desabafar sobre essa *merda* de governo corrupto, incompetente, egocêntrico, arrogante e desassociado da realidade fática.

Pois bem, chega de falar sobre mim, vamos ao que importa.

**1. Incompetência**

Um governo impopular, não eleito diretamente (não, quem votou na Dilma não esperava o governo Temer, por mais que seja em parte responsável), que visava a aprovar medidas impopulares.

Conseguiram aprovar a reforma trabalhista, e só isso. A reforma tem partes bem interessantes, partes que realmente modernizam o mercado de trabalho, e trechos inconstitucionais, como o que limita a indenização por danos morais.

Já a reforma da previdência, muito mais importante para reduzir o endividamento público? Nem saiu do papel.

Depois tentaram partir pro discurso da segurança pública e decretaram a primeira intervenção federal desde o regime militar. O resultado? Que resultado?

E agora, conseguiram ser tão pateticamente incompetentes ao lidar com essa greve dos caminhoneiros que deixaram a coisa chegar no nível atual. Se as reivindicações tivessem sido atendidas no segundo ou terceiro dia, não estaríamos vendo um protesto deste tamanho.

Eu ousaria afirmar que FHC, Lula e Dilma nunca foram tão incompetentes quanto Temer.

**2. Corrupção**

Não preciso me prolongar nesse ponto. Sabemos das gravações do Joesley, de como Temer conseguiu se safar das duas denúncias, da investigação do Decreto dos Portos, etc. Mesmo vendo tudo o que ocorria a seu redor, o governo prosseguiu com a velha política de sangria dos cofres públicos.

**3. Arrogância, egocentrismo e desconexão com a realidade**

Esse talvez seja o principal problema do governo Temer.

O governo apostou na inércia popular após o impeachment da Dilma, pensou que poderia influenciar investigações na PF, vender partes da floresta amazônica, afrouxar a definição de trabalho escravo (mesmo após nomear uma PGR que teve destaque na luta contra o trabalho escravo), conceder indulto a seus amigos, tudo sem reação.

O mero fato do MP, Judiciário e PF terem reagido deveria ter servido de sinal a Temer que suas artimanhas não seriam aceitas, mas ele insistiu.
Nomeou Marun, o cara que tentou salvar Cunha na Câmara dos Deputados, para ser o Ministro-Chefe da Secretaria de Governo. Achou que criar um Ministério Extraordinário de Segurança Pública bastaria para elevar sua popularidade.

O mesmo governo que diz querer defender a segurança pública tentou conceder indulto a todos os condenados por crimes não violentos que já tivessem cumprido 20% da pena, mais generoso que a progressão de regime, e até mesmo aos que se encontrassem em suspensão condicional do processo, que, por definição, **sequer condenados eram**, invadindo a competência exclusiva do Poder Judiciário.

Temer acreditou que a solução para sua impopularidade com os jovens seria criar uma conta no Twitter no estilo r/fellowkids, e chegou até mesmo a cogitar uma candidatura à reeleição quando seu índice de aprovação está em dígito único.

Quando começou a greve, Temer estava mais preocupado em se salvar da PF e em lançar um pré-candidato à Presidência da República. Quando finalmente foi negociar, pensou que um acordo com algumas entidades, feito às pressas e sem a concordância da associação dos autônomos (que representam quase 60% dos caminhoneiros atuais), bastaria para que os ânimos se acalmassem. Quando não deu, tentou jogar a bomba pro colo das Forças Armadas.

Esse é um governo que não se enxerga, que se vê como a locomotiva da Nação, quando em verdade não passa de uma maria-fumaça enferrujada. É um governo que não entende o verdadeiro significado de seu índice de aprovação ser 7%, que está realmente surpreso com a hostilidade popular após os abusos constantes nestes 2 anos, piores até mesmo que os do governo Dilma.

Já está mais do que na hora da renúncia.

"Okay, I'll let you know EVERY TIME",194,1319,False,False,False,MaliciousCompliance,1527472419.0,True,"Right, so I work in retail. For the most part, my job is fun. I like working here, though I don't plan on being here forever. There just one issue with the place- one of my managers. She's not even that high on the totem pole, to be honest. It goes me, team leader, global service team leader, , leadership on demand (I have no clue what to acronym LOD actually stands for, so I made that term up), and then Store Lead, the highest position in the store. This evil lady is a GSTL. Right in the middle.

I work in the self checkout, and she's always on my butt about absolutely nothing. She's the only manager with a problem with anyone ever. She's been here for 15 years too, and gets away with this crap.

As she hates my guts, I generally need her permission to even breathe. If I need to use the restroom (and I have to go a lot, sadly), I have to let her know so that the self checkout is still manned.

Except, half the time, and she knows this, I'll suddenly have to go RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I can't help it when this happens, and sometimes I can still hold it to let her know. Sometimes I can't, and have to run off.

Now, this literally takes me about a minute and a half tops. 15 seconds to get to the restroom, 20 seconds to relieve myself, 40 seconds to wash my hands, and 15 to get back. But if I do this without letting her know, and she catches me, all hell breaks loose.

Today, she caught me entering the restroom, then pulled me aside as I left it. She sits me down in a side room, and berates me for the next five minutes. I'd have been back at the self checkout long, long ago without her doing this.

She yelled at me because I need to think about all the stuff that could get stolen in that time, how if I'm not there, and a guest has an issue, I'm not there to fix it. I HAVE to tell her every time I leave my station for any reason now! Or else! It doesn't matter that none of that will happen when other people can see my station in that minute and it's very unlikely anything will go wrong.

I'm 100% done with this. I'm done with her. I'm already going to talk to HR about her later(they're going to look into her behavior. She has too many complaints), but I decide that you know what, I'm going to comply with her request. I'm going to comply... *Maliciously.*

Guest Services is literally two feet away from my station. When guests decide they don't want to buy an item, I usually just give it to them. Now, I'm announcing it over the radio. ""This is dman2life, leaving Blue Side Self Checkout to give the reshop to guest services.""

I said this maybe 20 times in my last three hours today. I also take orders or to people's cars and I would announce it every time, even though we have three devices that tell us when that is happening anyway. So the device would beep, and I'd ring everyone up on the radio.

Over and over. I'm going to keep doing this every day, until I'm allowed to use the restroom without permission during an emergency. Wish me luck.

EDIT: This pee issue happens maybe once or twice a day, and sometimes not at all. Usually, I can inform my boss that I need to pee and can hold it for her to respond. A few times, I car, and this happens. There other bosses are more understanding.

I'm also not loss prevention. There's also high definition cameras EVERYWHERE, including on the register itself, showing you it's watching you."

People complaining about the map being ahistorical or some of the tribes are actually just straight up dumb/ridiculous.,47,106,False,False,False,paradoxplaza,1527511592.0,True,"Oh shit I thought this was R/imperator . So for you guys wondering wtf I’m talking about in talking about Imperator Rome the new paradox grand strategy game about Rome and ancient shit.

I see some of you bastards saying “actually that one little tribe in Iberia that occupies 1/100000th of the land may have not have actually existed” and other statements just like that.

OK MOTHERFUCKERS, HISTORY LESSON TIME.

So in 300 god damn B.C. The only smelly poor bastards documenting history pretty much were the romans and the Greeks. We have tons of reliable history about the various groups and nations of Greece, Anatolia Italia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Everything else like France, Germany, and Iberia was literally just Bumfuck barbarian tribe #1 bumfuck barbarian tribe #2 all the way into the hundreds. Even the romans didn’t name all those pointless little shithut living barbarians and would make their names up.

So let me tell you this, in reality there are only a few important barbarian tribes. I will list them below (who still arent even 1/10th as important as Rome or the Seleucid empire who everyone is going to be playing over the shitass tribes anyway) 

In each barbarian region there were like 1-2 tribes that were actually important enough to be documented in Roman history well. 

For France we have the arvernii (badass axe throwing beard having motherfuckers) the belgae (read the arvernii statement above). 

For Germany we have basically no one except the fucks in the battle of teutoberg forest. But as far as I know, we have no really big named tribes in Germania untill like 300 ad.

The only major tribe I know in Spain is the turdetanii everyone else is pretty useless and irrelevant.

And before you bastards start commenting “actually mr fatfucko420 you forgot about the tittii tribe of Spain who were really influential over the two whole farms they ruled over” you can shut your bastard mouth, i don’t care about the smelly piss drInking barbarians who inhabited the county your from in France 2000 years ago.

But anyway let me get to my real point. Look me in the eye baby, paradox HAS to make up a bunch of random tribes to occupy the lands of Gaul, Germany and Iberia ok? Because we do know for 100% there were a billion small tribes living there we just don’t know their names. And there names aren’t even important anyway, they are just there to be conquered by the big dog tribes or Rome/carthago. 

So you can either have muhhh historikkal akkuracy and have only the tribes we 100% know existed but then we’d have swaths of unoccupied land that you’d have to just colonize (which was such a fucking stupid system in EU Rome and made no sense as it wasn’t just land for the romans to colonize; they did have to conquer it off those smelly little nameless ireeelevant tribes paradox is making up.) and in the end is that not more historically wrong then to just place the tribes there and make up their names, rather then really inflate the sizes and armies of the 3 tribes we know of that region to a massive size and have the rest of the land he blank unoccupied colonizable lands. Where you just click “colonize” and deal with a boring little rebellion every 10 minut e.

It’s just such a ludicrous unreasonable deman and complaint I’ve seen a ton of people making in the comments of the new dev diary. They literally want paradox to create a time machine and fuck off to 300BC and travel across every inch of god damn Europe and document all the tribes themselves. Paradox is definitely doing the best they possibly can with the map and muh historical accuracies. Trust me, I deeply care for historical accuracy myself and it looks great so far, I am optimistic!

I finally spoke up to my boyfriend about my weight/body issues and it feels great.,42,183,False,False,False,loseit,1527510102.0,True,"For as long as I know, I've always been the fat one out of all of my friends and I'm not exaggerating. I was overweight as a child and ballooned to obese in my first year of college due to the birth control I was on &amp; it being my first time living alone and having to fend for myself. I always had body issues and never truly loved myself until about 7 months ago when I had an epiphany. Some days are harder than others when it comes to loving yourself but when I do love myself, it feels great.

Anyways, last night I was on the phone with my boyfriend and we somehow got into the topic of weight and weight loss. He knew I wanted to lose 2lbs by the end of this month (and I did it! Now under 180) but he didn't know how much I weighed. I told him that weight was always a touchy subject for me because of how big I was growing up, not feeling as equal as my friends, etc. He told me that when we went to a museum earlier this month and I stepped on a scale that tells you what your body weight would be as an animal, he kinda saw what I weighed then but didn't really pay attention (around 185 at the time). He then proceeded to tell me what he weighed because I honestly thought that I weighed more than him (he weighs 220 but he's 6'1 so I'm guessing thats normal for someone his height). We moved onto a different topic but then I decided to just go for it and tell him what I weighed.

His response was ""That's not too bad"" and then asked how much more weight I want to lose to which I said 20-30lbs and he said ""hey, if you want to do it then go for it."". I was honestly so worried to tell him what I weighed because I was scared of feeling judged by him (I was about 10lbs heavier when him and I got together in January) but now I can honestly say that he does not care about my weight and only cares about my personality and who I am as a person, as cliche as that sounds.

But you know what? I'm fucking happy this morning that I finally opened up to someone other than my mom (who is supportive af about me losing weight) when it comes to this topic. It takes such a big weight off of my shoulders and now I'm hoping that I can finally be more comfortable around him, especially naked (not like I wasn't before but I was always self conscious in the back of my mind). To all of those who are nervous to opening up to your SO about your weight/body issues, just do it. It takes a big weight off of your shoulders and if they don't support you, then fuck them. "

She told me I was an awful husband and proceeded to insult me in every way possible. I made a pledge of becoming a better husband. However, the more i thought of that talk the more I understood that all those allegations are bullshit. She convinced me of stuff I didn't do and I became so afraid of loosing her that I immediately started to reverse all those thingss

However, the more i tried to became a better husband over the last months she would get irritated and aggressive, as if she prefered me as a bad person. She started to avoid me, avoid physical contact and so on.

I read thousands of articles about cheating and marital problems and all the pieces fit into a scenario of cheating spouse. But I ignored it, ""my wife, my trusty beautiful wife?"". It cant be.

My friends told me to check her facebook and phone, but I told them that I dont believe in that type of behavior. Until today.

Its seems that shes been fucking our son teacher for months. I'm 46, she's 42 and the teacher is 31. Also married with a 1 year old daughter. I'm gathering evidence but i dont know what to do. What can i do reddit? Talk to him, menace his relationship with his wife. My wife really likes him, it seems, but he's in it for the fucking alone."

In front of them, the hordes of hundreds of thousands of chaos demons. Loriel watched as the forests burned, her forests. She recognized one of the old trees which she had once used to learn to climb, in flames. She bit her cheek in frustration. She wanted to run in and eviscerate these demons, but she couldn’t do it on her own. These humans seemed almost lethargic, and definitely cowardly. “We need to attack!” she finally proclaimed, not being able to hold it any longer. “They are burning down our forest, our homes, we need to attack now!”

The human general sighed, before slowly and deliberately turning towards her “Princess, if you wish to go in alone, be our guest. But the armies of the Empire will not be forced into an engagement we did not choose.”

Loriel grabbed the general’s arm “Those are our homes, what would you do if those were your cities?”

The general slowly turned his head, blue eyes almost glowing like sapphires in his pale face. He looked into Loriel’s eyes. She gulped, and released his arm, what was this? Here was a creature many times weaker than her, many times younger, but she was the snivelling child again. “We would wait.” He said in monotone.

Regaining her composure, she argued again, “Are you saying that you would let these demons kill thousands of your people and raze your cities while you watched? Are you that kind of monster?”

The general turned back towards the burning husks of forests, “Yes, and perhaps.” Loriel looked at this crooked man incredulously. Finally he sighed, “Battles don’t matter, victory or defeat doesn't matter. The only thing that really does matter is whether or not you get what you want. If you can get what you want by loosing every battle, then that is true victory. If you win every battle, but can’t get what you want, then how can you call that anything but defeat. If we attack now, our people will fight in smoke and fire. That gives them an advantage. They are also more numerous, another advantage on their side. I also doubt that they are ignorant there exist hundreds of thousands of men behind these hills, so we don’t have surprise on our side.”

Loriel retorted angrily “So we do nothing!” The general betrayed a slight smile, a half smile, only there for a fraction of a second. What was this human thinking off? An aide soon rushed towards to them, a young human covered in what looked like soot. Likely a scout who had been near the demon’s pyres. At least this general wasn’t doing ignoring the very basics or warfare. Why her father would assign to her the duty of being the liaison between their armies was beyond her, probably another fantastical method of punishing her impetuousness. Though in her mind, she imagined that it also had to do with her habit of taking all the forces at her command and striking when the opportunity seemed right, not when she was ordered to. There were none of her troops to be commanded here, she was declawed. Loriel spat on the ground, desperately trying to imagine the ground as a mount of dead demons.

The scout seemed to talk at length with the general, but she payed him no mind. Her eyes were fixed on the enemy. They had evacuated the city long before, her people were safe for now in the human lands. They had taken what works of art and culture they could, but the great tree of Assel was now visibly charred – probably permanently dead if left like that any longer. Many of those which were not so big were probably cut down for fire\-wood or something equally vulgar. It was like watching a mother or a sister being raped and murdered in front of her very eyes.

“Princess” the general’s deep baritone finally called out, “Princess Loriel!” She turned around to face them. “I called out to you several times, are you alright?” he even looked slightly concerned, she would long remember the moment that this human showed anything but his confident demeanor publicly.

“My apologies, I was lost in thought.” She replied adamantly.

He placed his hand on Loriel’s shoulder, she only just kept herself from flinging him across the camp. “Forgivable Princess, but it is in the darkest hour that your wits will be most useful to you.” She wanted to retort, say something snarky, or claim that she had heard these lessons too many times before. But it wouldn’t have done much good. She was in no mood for a shouting match, and it wouldn’t look good for their alliance. She only bit her tongue and nodded, only too aware of the hand on her shoulder; these humans must have different sensibilities indeed. Had an elf touched a princess in such a way, his hand would have come off, regardless of rank or position. “Nevertheless,” the general continued “I think you should see this.” He waved towards the burning city.

She waited a few moments before replying through gritted teeth. “I have seen that very scene in my nightmares, general. I don’t want to keep seeing it while I am awake as well.”

As she faced him again, she realized that he had his hand raised high. Behind him, 4 groups of 5 human mages arranged themselves. Behind them were what appeared to be mortars \- dwarven technology – but on a far larger scale than what she had ever seen before, obviously augmented with magic. “Fire!” he cried out.

The mages performed a type of combined dance, weaving the natural energies between each other like a single artist painting on a canvas. Finally, in unison, all 20 mages fired the magic at the demons. Behind them, the mortars also fired together. She watched as all the shots arched over the hills and the forests hitting, not their city, but all the areas around it. Surprisingly, it would seem that the volley that should have had leveled the mountains themselves, did next to no damage. With the demon armies within still intact. “It seems you missed” jabbed Loriel before she could catch herself.

“Did we?” the general now grinned, an unnerving sight in itself. She looked back at the devastation.

The demonic armies swarmed out of the city towards their location, still some 10 miles away, but they would tread the distance in no time. Loriel’s hand reached to her bow.

Boom!

An explosion rang out as a pillar of lightning appeared in front of them. Consuming a large portion of the armies in front of them. Still they came, Boom! More explosions of lightning and ice and earth consumed the opposing armies as they came closer. Of course, that’s what the scout had been setting up. Magical traps need a power source. No magic could be cast inside the forest since that would alert the demons, so that first volley was the power source. And since it comes from below them, the demon’s sky defence could not protect them from damage from underground as it would have if they had aimed at them directly. Boom! Boom! Boom! trap after trap were springing, but the hordes still came in the tens of thousands.

“Rank two, Fire!” the general cried again. A cacophony of massive explosions from behind her indicated that cannons now fired. What sounded like thousands of cannons, echoing in the hills around them, fired from behind every hill top around them. The first few bounced off the magical barrier of the demons, but the sheer magnitude of iron shells soon overwhelmed their worlocks. After all it was easier to defend against magic than simple Iron balls after all. It wasn’t long before their numbers were slowly ripped apart by the simple cannonballs, then the explosive ones. The volley stopped “Rank two! Fire at Will!” The general cried out. Bit by bit, the demon’s ranks were obliterated, with no way of fighting back. Still, they started to close the distance quickly. It wouldn't be long now, she readied her bow.

But, a glimmer of armor caught her eye. From the corner of her eyes she realised what the larger plan was. Tens of thousands of infantry and horsemen started to encircle the demons. All the demon’s attention was focused on them, they didn’t or couldn’t see what was going on around them. The General baited them, and these demons took it like a rat in a cage. Even from here, she could see the battle was already over, only a few minutes after the first volley. “Cease fire!” The general cried out. The bombardment stopped.

the two human armies pincer the demonic hordes between them. The human infantry lines split the horde and held their ground, while the cavalry stormed the breaches and attacked them from the rear. Within an hour, the last remnants of the demons had been killed. The city was theirs again.

She couldn’t help but suppress a grin. She finally turned to this general, “Well then, Prince\-General Constantine, for someone who claims that victory and defeat are one and the same. You surprised me by how well you can win.”

He looked back at her through the corner of his eye and a sly smile on his face, “Coming from you that’s great praise.”

This time she grabbed his shoulder, returning the favor so as to speak, “Remind me never to enter a war with you against me.” He gave a slight bow before turning back to the battlefield, she was a bit irritated by his lack of acceptance of her praise. After a few moments, he turned to face her again, this time with a sadder look in his face. “I am very serious, Prince,” Loriel said “All elves of this land are in your debt, not only for saving the city, but also for causing so little damage to it. No matter what happens from here onward, but if ever you come back here, no matter what other business we may have with you or your people, you will be treated as a king.” He curtly thanked her, before walking away. These humans are impossible! She thought, “Constantine! Is something wrong? You should be proud! You have achieved a great victory today!”

He turned around. “I will celebrate later. Many people died here today, not as many as could be expected, but still very many. And the war has only just started. And remember that we can win every battle and still lose the war.”"

The Rise and Fall of the Republic of Italy (1576 - 1593),16,132,False,False,False,eu4,1527514164.0,True,"It is New Year’s Day, in the Year of Our Lord, 1576. Tens of thousands of people crowd the streets of Rome, to see the beginning of a new era in Italy.

For the past month Italy has been abuzz with activity and excitement as the Grand Consul of the Republic of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Alessandri, has toured the north on his way to Rome, visiting major towns and cities, waving to the crowds and embracing the land’s leading men; nobles and bishops and merchants. 

Not two weeks ago these same towns and cities had sent out loyal men to join the ranks of General Marcello Arborio Mella’s army as it stormed across Italy, crushing the combined forces of the Papal States, the Duchy of Urbino and the Swiss Republic, the last remaining enemies to Italian unification. But the war was won by the Republic of Milan, and now no one stands in the way of progress and greatness.

The ancient city of Rome was occupied by General Mella’s army in November of 1575, effectively bringing an end to the brief but bloody war. At the peace talks, Duke Guidantonio II of Urbino agreed to dissolve his alliance with the Kingdom of France, a staunch ally of Milan’s \(who had only sat out joining this war because of a war with Austria over the hotly contested Sundgau province in the Rhineland\), and the Swiss Republic dissolved their alliance with the Papal State and paid Milan a relatively small reparation.

The results of the war for the Papal State was far more severe. Ownership of the city of Rome and its surrounding farmlands was ceded to Milan, and Pope Innocentius IX departed the Vatican in outrage, making for his last remaining city in Italy \- Naples. Once he arrived there he promptly issued an excommunication bull against Grand Consul Alessandri, but this changed nothing. Rome was lost to him forever, and soon, as it turns out, would be Italy entirely, for in the next month the Kingdom of Naples declared war on the Pope, promptly retaking the city of Naples after it had been lost to them for half a century.

With all of his earthly possessions taken from him, the Pope fled Italy for the Imperial lands in Germany. The Emperor – Joseph II of Austria – was sympathetic to his plight and granted him the modest city of Loon in the Low Countries. The Pope, sullen but determined to continue his resistance against Milan if not by war then by word, moved his court to Loon, a tiny Catholic stronghold surrounded by the Protestant hordes on all sides.

And so it came to be that on the 1st of January 1576, Grand Consul Alessandri entered Rome in triumph, just as the Roman generals of the ancient world did, and greeted the crowd of tens of thousands assembled there. He embraced General Mella and as a reward for his invaluable service to the Republic granted him the title of ‘Head of the Armies of Italy’. Eschewing the trappings of monarchy that the Republic of Milan so vigorously resisted, the Grand Consul instead took on oath on the Bible to uphold the freedoms and dignity of the people of all of Italy, and to continue the fight to unify this country so long divided.

In the year 1576, the map of Europe was changed forever.

The next ten years saw a consistent growth in Italian prosperity and power. The army and navy were both enlarged considerably, more trade income was gathered from the Ligurian Sea and not just the Adriatic, and the Grand Consul gradually begun limiting the power of the estates by stripping away their land and privileges to centralise power in Italy more with the government in Rome rather than on a provincial level. A brief and successful war against the Republic of Lucca saw the annexation of the cities of Lucca and Pisa, further unifying the Republic of Italy.

But not all was as it should be. Away from the staunchly republican atmosphere of Milan, Grand Consul Alessandri gradually began indulging in more autocratic behaviour. He stopped consulting the Senate on matters of state and schemed so that he was given multiple terms in office rather than the customary one. At first very few complained, the immense popularity of the Consul still creating an aura of near\-divinity around him, but as the years went by people began to get more concerned.

It was in the year 1587, 11 years since the founding of the Republic of Italy, that things came to a head. A couple of days after the most recent election saw Alessandri elected near unanimously for Grand Consul yet again \(an election that not even the most naïve person believed to be free and genuine\), two dozen leading members of the Senate confronted Alessandri with an ultimatum: step down immediately as Grand Consul or you will be impeached.

The Grand Consul considered the document for a few moments and then tore it up right in front of them, before turning his back and calling for the guards. He ordered the arrest of these senators for treason, and the guards duly complied without a word of opposition.

News of this shocking encounter spread like wildfire through Rome, and the next day all pretensions were dropped. Grand Consul Alessandri appeared before the Senate – sans those senators that had been thrown in prison – and told them that as of this date – the 25th of April, 1587 – there would be no further elections and no further talk of replacing Alessandri, who promptly ditched the old title of Grand Consul and ordered them to refer to him as the Lord Protector of the Republic of Italy.

The two dozen senators locked in the dungeons below the Lord Protector’s palace were given a choice: publically acknowledge Alessandri as Lord Protector for life, or be executed for treason.

The election of Duke Václav V of Bohemia as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire the next year brought significant change to Italian\-Imperial relations. Formerly, with the Austrians holding Emperorship, things were incredibly tense, with the Republic of Milan siding with their ally France against the Austrians in several wars, and things got even more tense when Emperor Joseph II publically converted to Protestantism, giving in to pressure from the many Protestant princes surrounding him. He had failed to defeat the Protestant League in the 1570's and gave up on reasserting Catholicism in the Empire. There there genuine fears in Italy that Protestantism would spread to the peninsula, although the Grand Consuls were quick to stamp out any possible Protestant activity and keep Italy firmly Catholic.

A mere three days after Václav was elected Emperor, Lord Protector Alessandri began making overtures to the Bohemians in the hope of forming an alliance. As long\-time foes of the Austrians, the Bohemian Emperor was all too happy to form an alliance with Italy. This deeply concerned the Austrians, who were now surrounded to the north\-east and south\-west by long\-time enemies.

The death of General Mella in March of 1590 was mourned by all of the Italian Republic, with the Lord Protector giving him a hugely expensive and lavish state funeral and decreeing a week of public mourning. He then gave the deceased general the honourific posthumous title of ‘Hero of the Republic’. 

The next day Lord Protector Alessandri appointed himself Head of the Armies of Italy.

Beginning in October of the same year, the Lord Protector dramatically increased his efforts to strip the estates of their power and influence, sending government officials to formally acquire their assets and property. The first target were the merchants, who for decades had been funnelling trade income into their private businesses rather than state coffers. There were revolts all over Northern Italy, which the Lord Protector crushed with incredible brutality until no opposition remained and the central government was stronger than ever before. 

By July of 1591 no more land in the Republic of Italy was owned by any estate.

On the 5th of February, 1593, as the sun first rose over the mountains and lit up the fields around Rome with a dull golden glow, the corpse of Lord Protector Alessandri was found in his bed. He had been stabbed a dozen times, including once in the heart. His personal bodyguard was then found dead as well, the dozen corpses strewn about in the Tiber.

The people of Rome awoke, that morning, to a new man leading Italy – Lodovico Maria di Malaspina, a 20\-year\-old brazen young man from one of Milan’s oldest noble families, who had been plotting the downfall of Alessandri ever since he was 17 and the Lord Protector began stripping the estates of their influence and power. Lodovico was granted the support of the noble estate in exchange for him recognising their traditional and sacred rights and privileges. He agreed, and so they helped install him as king.

It was on the 5th of March, 1593, that from the Forum in the heart of the city, King Lodovico declared the Republic dissolved and the Kingdom of Italy established. In the following days marriage proposals were sent out to the major European powers and allies of Italy – France, Spain, Bohemia.

The era of the republic was over.

I hope you guys enjoyed reading this. You'll have to forgive the rather extreme length of this post; I've been a writer long before an EU4 player. I know these types of posts are pretty rare on here, but I thoroughly enjoyed playing and writing this, so why not? Of course I took quite a bit of artistic licence in parts \- mostly to add flavour, but all of it is based on things that actually happened in my current Milan \&gt; Italy game, such as forming Italy on 1st January 1576 as the Ambrosian Republic, being excommunicated, the Pope fleeing to the Low Countries, the republic becoming a dictatorship under its first ruler, the destruction of the estates and the transition from a dictatorship to a kingdom under King Lodovico on the 5th of February 1593."

Can I just say about blaming the Jews for everything...,239,142,False,False,False,conspiracy,1527512274.0,True,"Hey Everyone,

I think I need to take some time to drive home a fundamental truth. We are all human beings and are privvy to the same range of biases and emotions as every other human being.

The fact that there is a financial elite that are in control of media and craft messages to keep people confirming their own biases isn't because the subscribe to a particular religion or belong to a certain race. They are just bad human beings. 

It worries me immensely that the kind of circular logic where people think ""some rich humans are bad and they happen to be Jewish, therefore Jews are bad"" has arisen again and its exactly the same kind of logic Hitler used to develop his campaign and eventually the Nazi Party. 

We need to move back to understanding that its the actions of bad human beings in isolation if we are to evolve as a species and begin tackling the issues these bad human beings create effectively.

Peace.

EDIT: I'm really glad people can still have a discussion here. Some people are being unfair and a bit mean spirited in this thread but because this blew up I'm going to leave you with my favourite meme. I always use it to frame my thinking when it comes to human issues.

""Thwack"": The Kenku monk

Idikay: The Halfling rogue (myself)


""Thwack"" (who's name is literally the sound of a staff hitting something) can't speak because he's a birdman, but can write beautifully wants to say something to Tal'theril. He writes her a note. 


She is a druid who has been away from civilization for a long time, can only speak elvish and broken common, and is completely illiterate. Looks at the note funny and hands it over to me.


I read the note to her in common. Understanding what I read, she replies in elvish. I only speak common and don't understand her. 


She then replies in  broken common, so broken that we have to make a perception check to try understand her.


I fail the check, ""Thwack"" passes and the whole process starts all over again, lol.


We got a surprising amount accomplished during that session, including beating two phase spiders and working out some military style hand signals for the next conflict.


It was a fun time had by all, a lot of laughs. Especially when we (or NPCs)  failed the perception check and DM interpreted what we thought we heard."

Enough of the EULA clickbait posts. I think it's time for a new rule regarding it.,34,101,False,False,False,KerbalSpaceProgram,1527517233.0,True,"Often enough on this subreddit, people like to post ""sudden"" and ""shocking"" ""news"" about Take-Two and KSP's new EULA and how it's ""effectively spyware"".

While active discussion about changes to the EULA are important, there have been no actual substantive changes in the text itself from the one you agreed to when Squad alone controlled the game.

Furthermore, KSP can be played completely offline, behind a firewall, and simultaneously among several Steam family accounts. In fact, KSP is one of the least connected games released in the last 10 years.

The issues regarding the terms have been settled:

1. You're not as important as you hope.

2. If you're honestly that concerned about spyware, you wouldn't be posting about it on Reddit.

3. If you're seriously paranoid enough to stop playing KSP, you could simply put a new rule in your firewall regarding outbound transmissions, and still continue to play.

4. That the people complaining about it don't understand this proves that fears are unwarranted.

5. Posts concerning EULA, at this point in May 2018 and earlier, are all only trying to stir up fear or troll users.

6. Your ISP, your cel carrier, Google, Amazon, Steam, heck, Reddit itself all know FAR more about you than KSP, Squad/Private Division or Take 2 would care to know.

That being said, actual new substantive behavioral changes to the game or the launcher SHOULD be addressed and be made public.

Therefore, I suggest that we adopt a new rule regarding threads concerning EULA changes, if only to make people aware that it's officially not an issue. 

My personal spitballing first thought is that in addition to a sidebar rule along the lines that ""If there are new changes regarding game EULA, an up-to-date Moderator post will address them,"" perhaps a stickie at the top of the Hot list or a link in the new rule to a permanent Mod post would be sufficient. I am not suggesting that this is the best answer, nor am I saying that future updated EULA should never be addressed, it's just the first thing that occurred to me to stop the proliferation of the EULA posts."

The sad reason I need more solo content: all my friends are gone.,784,6164,False,False,False,DestinyTheGame,1527461694.0,True,"I've noticed an uprising in posts regarding solo queueing in Crucible, and the need for improved matchmaking and other measures for solo PvE content.  I think something that needs to be talked about, that has so far been left out of the conversation, is *why* solo content is becoming so important.


I used to have an amazing raid group.  We formed at the start of TTK and we would reset raid every week.  We got to know each other really well and had a blast doing it.  There were plenty of shenanigans but we still managed to blast out 3x Oryx/Aksis in about 3-4 hours.  The rest of the week we'd hang out and play Crucible, Nightfalls, etc.  They were legitimate friends, even though it was over the online medium.


They're all gone now, *all* of them.  My friends list (for people playing Destiny) is a barren wasteland.  When I ask if they want to play, most are so jaded the response is something like ""screw that shitty game.""  Or, they ask me, ""why are you still playing Destiny?"" with complete incredulity.


This has left me with 2 main feelings about group play in D2.  First, I am less interested in joining a new clan or making a whole new set of friends, for the few times I have tried, those people have ended up disappearing too, and it totally sucks.  Second, as the population drops, LFG has become more toxic and I just don't have the time to grind prestige Calus 50x just to be invited into a group.


So, I need solo content.  I need matchmaking.  I want to play the game just to relax and get some stress out, and get some decent loot in the process.  But it seems like Bungie is still designing activities around the old population numbers and player base.  Escalation Protocol is a perfect example - with my old group I'd be happy to team up with 2 others and discuss tactics and coordinate weapons/roles and all that.  Now, I just would like to load into a zone and be able to complete it with a group of randoms, because it's just not as fun to try to mesh play styles with an LFG stranger.


So, the point of this, is that if anyone from Bungie sees this, I would appreciate if you started to develop more content towards solo players, because that seems to be the majority of who are left at this point.  I think people will return for the fall DLC, but I fear so many parts of the game are fundamentally broken (atmosphere, tone, abilities, the feel of weapons, loot, etc) that we'll never be at D1 levels of engagement.  That isn't necessarily a terrible thing, it just means Bungie needs to know who their audience *is*, instead of who they should be.

Bryan with a 'y',17,73,False,False,False,nosleep,1527523539.0,True,"Hi there. My name is Bryan. That's Bryan with a 'y', to be clear. Brian with an 'i' looks boring when you write it down.

I'm 27 years old, and I work as a web developer. I'm about 5'11"", I have blond hair and light brown eyes, and I can't grow a beard all that well. I've been married to my wife, Lyn, for almost two years now. It was truly a match made in heaven, and I'll tell you why today.

I was 18 years old when I first met Lyn. I had just started university at UCLA, and she sat in the row behind me in my MATH-101 class. After class, she got up hastily and just about ran out the door. She seemed to be muttering to herself, and looked extremely uncomfortable overall. Something pushed me to go talk to her, so I ran to catch up.

""Hey,"" I said as I gently touched her shoulder.

She practically screamed.

I was taken aback. ""Uh, did I do something wrong?""

""Nonono,"" she replied, obviously flustered. ""I was just, uh, focused on other stuff. That's all.""

""Well, as long as you're okay..."" I said as I turned around to leave.

""Wait!"" she exclaimed. ""I, uh, you're actually one of the first people to approach me."" She looked at the floor. ""Do you want to, maybe, hang out sometime?""

I looked at her more closely. She was tall for a girl, probably only two or three inches shorter than me. She had green eyes and wore her red hair in a low ponytail. Her awkward smile told me she was being serious. ""Sure,"" I replied, extending my hand in her direction. ""I'm Bryan. That's Bryan with a 'y'.""

Her smile widened as she shook my hand. ""Caitlyn,"" she said. ""Caitlyn with a 'c'."" I couldn't help but laugh at that remark. She chuckled as well. ""Do you want to maybe go get coffee together right now? If you have the time, that is.""

""Yeah, my schedule's pretty free today,"" I answered.

""Great!"" she beamed. ""I have to go drop off my books at my place. It's on the way there.""

So I walked her back to where she was staying. On the way, I learned that she'd always been a huge introvert. She only had a couple of friends through all of high school. Her roommates consisted of one of her only friends, plus two mutuals. They were all late in applying for residence, so they got a house together. At some point, she scribbled down her number on a sticky note and gave it to me.

When we got there, I asked to use her bathroom. In the excitement of meeting a girl, I'd forgotten to relieve myself before we left. Thankfully, she let me in.

""The downstairs bathroom doesn't flush properly. We're trying to get the landlord to fix it. You can use the upstairs one for now. I'll probably be done once you are."" She showed me to the bathroom, then entered the room immediately past it.

I did my business and flushed. As I was washing my hands, I heard Caitlyn flop onto her bed. Then, a conversation. I couldn't be sure at the time, but it sounded like Caitlyn's was the only voice. But I was sure there were two different roles.

""When are you going to ask that guy out?""

""Didn't I already? I asked him out to coffee.""

""HA! You really think he looks at that like a date? He barely even knows you! If you're gonna do it, then do it properly.""

""Then why don't you do it?""

""You know why I can't do it.""

""Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry. Just don't let me screw it up too badly, alright?""

I shut off the water. As I did so, I heard the springs bounce as Caitlyn got up. She met me in the hall. I decided to ask her about the conversation in her room.

""So, I heard you talking to someone in your room.""

""Wait you heard that?""

""Uh, yeah the walls are like paper thin and you were pretty much yelling. Is there anything I can help you with, besides dating you?""

She turned red at this. ""I, uh, no it's not something you can fix, but um dating me would help."" She smiled awkwardly.

""Are you gonna explain, or is this a touchy topic?""

She thought for a moment. ""Fine,"" she said. ""I have another person inside of me. It's not like skitzophrenia or anything, it's literally a second person in my body. Her name is Katelyn - that's Katelyn with a 'k' - and neither of us are too thrilled to be in this position. She's actually awake right now, and she's pretty furious at me for telling you about her.""

""That's...cool."" I tried to hide my surprise. ""Is there any reason why she wants me to date you, or was she just poking fun at you?""

""Actually, she thinks you have one too. A second person, I mean.""

At this, I suddenly felt dizzy. I shook my head, and then I was standing beside myself. Except now 'I' had blue eyes. 

""She's right. I'm Brian. Brian with an 'i',"" said the blue-eyed me.

Caitlyn's eyes turned a bright purple. She smiled at Brian. ""I'm Katelyn. Katelyn with a 'k'.""

I passed out at that point. When I came to, Caitlyn or Katelyn, I can't remember which, was nursing a head wound from my fall. Afterwards, Caitlyn told me that this wasn't too rare, and some people even had a boy and a girl in the same body. Those people, usually Jamie, Taylor, Morgan, or similar, usually killed themselves because of the constant stress of living in the same body as someone of the opposite gender.

I eventually learned to live with Brian. Caitlyn and I even developed a system for addressing each other: I was Bry, Brian was Ian, Caitlyn was Lyn and Katelyn was Kate.

The second person comes with its benefits too. The human body only really needs four hours of sleep, but the brain needs closer to eight. Brian and I only sleep at the same time for four hours a day, giving the body time to rest. The other four hours take place during our work day, when we each work a four-hour shift and sleep the other four. Whenever Brian gets a comment on his eyes, he just says they change depending on the light.

If it wasn't for Lyn, I might have never discovered this gift. I suggest all of you try this: call out to the back corners of your mind. See if there's someone else there.

You might just find a new friend."

"(Discussion) Let The Games Begin: Tesla Running New ""Dutch Auction"" Strategy for CPO Sales",18,60,False,False,False,teslamotors,1527527229.0,True,"Hello all, CPO Hunter here, sharing an interesting observation that's changing the CPO game as we head into summer.

The past year or so has seen a lot of interesting behavior in how Tesla handles CPO sales.

For the first while if its existence, the CPO program was seen a as a good way to get a reasonable deal on a used but fully reconditioned Tesla vehicle, with a four year warranty to back it up.  The deals available got even sweeter for some lower end consumers when Tesla expanded its CPO program to vehicles over 50,000 miles, albeit with half the warranty.  The beginning of the ""2 year CPO"" offerings saw some of the lowest CPO prices ever recorded, with lucky buyers being able to get into a fully reconditioned Model S in the high $30,000 range.

Then Tesla did a complete 180.  The CPO program was basically soft\-cancelled, as Tesla decided to hold back units to build out its rental fleet.  What CPOs did remain were priced so outrageously that it was hard not to argue Tesla was just trying to steer you into a new 75D instead of buying used.

However, as of this month \(May 2018\), the CPO program is back, with an aggressive new Dutch Auction pricing strategy.  For those not familiar with the term, a Dutch Auction is one in which the price starts very high, but is lowered rapidly until a buyer emerges.  Tesla (and any car lot for that matter) has used this strategy to an extent since day one; cars that sat too long in the CPO program would eventually see price decreases, usually after several weeks.  However what we are seeing now is a completely different thing.

Tesla is dropping prices on many CPOs by **several hundred dollars per day every day**.  As a result, sharp\-eyed CPO hunters are using CPO tracking alerts to stay updated on cars that match their interest profile, and then swooping in when the price reaches their desired level.  This creates interesting disparities:

[Model S 60, 41k miles, pre\-AutoPilot: currently $60,300: ](https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJSA1S19FFP77076?redirect=no)

Compare with P66139, a P85D \(!!\), 39k miles with Autopilot, sold for $59,700!

Now let's look at the price history for that bargain P85D:

|5/20/18|$59,700|
|:-|:-|
|5/19/18|$60,300|
|5/17/18|$60,900|
|5/16/18|$61,500|
|5/15/18|$62,100|
|.....|....|
|5/6/18|$67,600 \(beginning dutch auction price\)|

Who knows how low this car would have gotten had someone not swooped it up?  There will be deals to be had in the coming days for consumers who pay attention.

Happy hunting!

We need more FIAT gateways to increase Cryptocurrency adoption - COSS just added 4 FIAT pairs,43,107,False,False,False,CryptoCurrency,1527524088.0,True,I was talking to a coworker about Cryptocurrency and telling him why now might be a good time for him to get in and start investing. Only problem is in Canada several banks are starting to restrict Cryptocurrency purchases using both Credit and Debit (i.e. TD Bank). For example using your credit card with Coinbase is almost impossible now for most Canadian banks. Coinbase was one of the primary methods for the average Joe to enter crypto in Canada. Me and several other friends got into cryptocurrency early 2017 because of the ease of access. One of the problems with this is that when my coworker tried to purchase cryptocurrency on Coinbase recently and got rejected he didn't bother trying other avenues. Other not as well known options however do work such as COSS. I recommended he try COSS which added a new FIAT purchasing gateway recently. He was able to successfully deposit USD using COSS and purchased ETH. Anyways the point is that having more FIAT gateways is extremely important so that users have several options of purchasing crypto in case one option doesn't work. We need to do our part and help spread awareness of other FIAT gateways that have worked well for others. Another one for Canadian users that works really well is Coinsquare. So if you're stuck figuring out how to invest in Cryptocurrency give COSS or coinsquare a try!

Walker's French Frys - then and now. A review of 9 year old crisps,16,90,False,False,False,CasualUK,1527527479.0,True,"A couple of weeks ago u/dokky found a load of Walkers French Fries that were [nearly 9 years out of date](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8ju3dd/found_half_a_box_of_these_anyone_hungry/), I asked for a pack and he delivered!

So I bought some modern ones and did a comparison. Unfortunately I could only find them in a multipack so have a smaller pack than individually sold ones \(multipack 18g vs 21g for a modern individual pack vs 22g for the old individual pack\).

[Front of pack](https://i.imgur.com/0bEgLhY.jpg)

[Back of pack](https://i.imgur.com/6OKSQo2.jpg?1)

[Crisp comparison](https://i.imgur.com/E6o5LEf.jpg)

**Packaging**

The packaging has been given a revamp, with a new font that looks more like the contents. The new packaging has no mention of Sunseed oil, so I guess Walkers have dumped the branded oil though continue to use sunflower oil. The older one looks to have been following a relatively recent reformulation as it talks about having 45&amp;#37; less salt \(than in 2005\) and 80&amp;#37; less saturated fat \(than in 2006\).

The packaging overall looks less cluttered on the new one, the health focus is less on the saturated fat content and more on having only 79 calories a bag and no artificial colours. The newer packaging also includes allergy advice which is missing on the 2009 version.

The newer bag has been printed at a higher resolution.

**Nutrition**

The new version apparently has more calories \(438 vs 430 per 100g\), however the gram amounts of the contents remain the same \(except salt, which has been reduced from 2.34 to 2.30g per 100g\). Ingredients more or less the same, though wheat flour and malic acid have been dropped from the flavouring recipe.

**Taste**

It will come as no surprise that crisps nearly 9 years past their best before date are past their best. They appear to be edible, you could eat them in a zombie apocalypse but they aren't good. There is no longer really a salt and vinegar flavour just a faint flavour of something not good and they have gone stale. The modern version taste as I remember them tasting in 1997.

Overall I recommend buying a new packet rather than eating ones nearly a decade past their best before date, even though they have 8 more calories per 100g. However, they are also virtually impossible to find not in a mixed flavour multi\-pack so unfortunately those of us who loathe cheese and onion will continue to miss out.

"Okay, I'll let you know EVERY TIME",194,1325,False,False,False,MaliciousCompliance,1527472419.0,True,"Right, so I work in retail. For the most part, my job is fun. I like working here, though I don't plan on being here forever. There just one issue with the place- one of my managers. She's not even that high on the totem pole, to be honest. It goes me, team leader, global service team leader, , leadership on demand (I have no clue what to acronym LOD actually stands for, so I made that term up), and then Store Lead, the highest position in the store. This evil lady is a GSTL. Right in the middle.

I work in the self checkout, and she's always on my butt about absolutely nothing. She's the only manager with a problem with anyone ever. She's been here for 15 years too, and gets away with this crap.

As she hates my guts, I generally need her permission to even breathe. If I need to use the restroom (and I have to go a lot, sadly), I have to let her know so that the self checkout is still manned.

Except, half the time, and she knows this, I'll suddenly have to go RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I can't help it when this happens, and sometimes I can still hold it to let her know. Sometimes I can't, and have to run off.

Now, this literally takes me about a minute and a half tops. 15 seconds to get to the restroom, 20 seconds to relieve myself, 40 seconds to wash my hands, and 15 to get back. But if I do this without letting her know, and she catches me, all hell breaks loose.

Today, she caught me entering the restroom, then pulled me aside as I left it. She sits me down in a side room, and berates me for the next five minutes. I'd have been back at the self checkout long, long ago without her doing this.

She yelled at me because I need to think about all the stuff that could get stolen in that time, how if I'm not there, and a guest has an issue, I'm not there to fix it. I HAVE to tell her every time I leave my station for any reason now! Or else! It doesn't matter that none of that will happen when other people can see my station in that minute and it's very unlikely anything will go wrong.

I'm 100% done with this. I'm done with her. I'm already going to talk to HR about her later(they're going to look into her behavior. She has too many complaints), but I decide that you know what, I'm going to comply with her request. I'm going to comply... *Maliciously.*

Guest Services is literally two feet away from my station. When guests decide they don't want to buy an item, I usually just give it to them. Now, I'm announcing it over the radio. ""This is dman2life, leaving Blue Side Self Checkout to give the reshop to guest services.""

I said this maybe 20 times in my last three hours today. I also take orders or to people's cars and I would announce it every time, even though we have three devices that tell us when that is happening anyway. So the device would beep, and I'd ring everyone up on the radio.

Over and over. I'm going to keep doing this every day, until I'm allowed to use the restroom without permission during an emergency. Wish me luck.

EDIT: This pee issue happens maybe once or twice a day, and sometimes not at all. Usually, I can inform my boss that I need to pee and can hold it for her to respond. A few times, I car, and this happens. There other bosses are more understanding.

I'm also not loss prevention. There's also high definition cameras EVERYWHERE, including on the register itself, showing you it's watching you."

I finally spoke up to my boyfriend about my weight/body issues and it feels great.,42,182,False,False,False,loseit,1527510102.0,True,"For as long as I know, I've always been the fat one out of all of my friends and I'm not exaggerating. I was overweight as a child and ballooned to obese in my first year of college due to the birth control I was on &amp; it being my first time living alone and having to fend for myself. I always had body issues and never truly loved myself until about 7 months ago when I had an epiphany. Some days are harder than others when it comes to loving yourself but when I do love myself, it feels great.

Anyways, last night I was on the phone with my boyfriend and we somehow got into the topic of weight and weight loss. He knew I wanted to lose 2lbs by the end of this month (and I did it! Now under 180) but he didn't know how much I weighed. I told him that weight was always a touchy subject for me because of how big I was growing up, not feeling as equal as my friends, etc. He told me that when we went to a museum earlier this month and I stepped on a scale that tells you what your body weight would be as an animal, he kinda saw what I weighed then but didn't really pay attention (around 185 at the time). He then proceeded to tell me what he weighed because I honestly thought that I weighed more than him (he weighs 220 but he's 6'1 so I'm guessing thats normal for someone his height). We moved onto a different topic but then I decided to just go for it and tell him what I weighed.

His response was ""That's not too bad"" and then asked how much more weight I want to lose to which I said 20-30lbs and he said ""hey, if you want to do it then go for it."". I was honestly so worried to tell him what I weighed because I was scared of feeling judged by him (I was about 10lbs heavier when him and I got together in January) but now I can honestly say that he does not care about my weight and only cares about my personality and who I am as a person, as cliche as that sounds.

But you know what? I'm fucking happy this morning that I finally opened up to someone other than my mom (who is supportive af about me losing weight) when it comes to this topic. It takes such a big weight off of my shoulders and now I'm hoping that I can finally be more comfortable around him, especially naked (not like I wasn't before but I was always self conscious in the back of my mind). To all of those who are nervous to opening up to your SO about your weight/body issues, just do it. It takes a big weight off of your shoulders and if they don't support you, then fuck them. "

In front of them, the hordes of hundreds of thousands of chaos demons. Loriel watched as the forests burned, her forests. She recognized one of the old trees which she had once used to learn to climb, in flames. She bit her cheek in frustration. She wanted to run in and eviscerate these demons, but she couldn’t do it on her own. These humans seemed almost lethargic, and definitely cowardly. “We need to attack!” she finally proclaimed, not being able to hold it any longer. “They are burning down our forest, our homes, we need to attack now!”

The human general sighed, before slowly and deliberately turning towards her “Princess, if you wish to go in alone, be our guest. But the armies of the Empire will not be forced into an engagement we did not choose.”

Loriel grabbed the general’s arm “Those are our homes, what would you do if those were your cities?”

The general slowly turned his head, blue eyes almost glowing like sapphires in his pale face. He looked into Loriel’s eyes. She gulped, and released his arm, what was this? Here was a creature many times weaker than her, many times younger, but she was the snivelling child again. “We would wait.” He said in monotone.

Regaining her composure, she argued again, “Are you saying that you would let these demons kill thousands of your people and raze your cities while you watched? Are you that kind of monster?”

The general turned back towards the burning husks of forests, “Yes, and perhaps.” Loriel looked at this crooked man incredulously. Finally he sighed, “Battles don’t matter, victory or defeat doesn't matter. The only thing that really does matter is whether or not you get what you want. If you can get what you want by loosing every battle, then that is true victory. If you win every battle, but can’t get what you want, then how can you call that anything but defeat. If we attack now, our people will fight in smoke and fire. That gives them an advantage. They are also more numerous, another advantage on their side. I also doubt that they are ignorant there exist hundreds of thousands of men behind these hills, so we don’t have surprise on our side.”

Loriel retorted angrily “So we do nothing!” The general betrayed a slight smile, a half smile, only there for a fraction of a second. What was this human thinking off? An aide soon rushed towards to them, a young human covered in what looked like soot. Likely a scout who had been near the demon’s pyres. At least this general wasn’t doing ignoring the very basics or warfare. Why her father would assign to her the duty of being the liaison between their armies was beyond her, probably another fantastical method of punishing her impetuousness. Though in her mind, she imagined that it also had to do with her habit of taking all the forces at her command and striking when the opportunity seemed right, not when she was ordered to. There were none of her troops to be commanded here, she was declawed. Loriel spat on the ground, desperately trying to imagine the ground as a mount of dead demons.

The scout seemed to talk at length with the general, but she payed him no mind. Her eyes were fixed on the enemy. They had evacuated the city long before, her people were safe for now in the human lands. They had taken what works of art and culture they could, but the great tree of Assel was now visibly charred – probably permanently dead if left like that any longer. Many of those which were not so big were probably cut down for fire\-wood or something equally vulgar. It was like watching a mother or a sister being raped and murdered in front of her very eyes.

“Princess” the general’s deep baritone finally called out, “Princess Loriel!” She turned around to face them. “I called out to you several times, are you alright?” he even looked slightly concerned, she would long remember the moment that this human showed anything but his confident demeanor publicly.

“My apologies, I was lost in thought.” She replied adamantly.

He placed his hand on Loriel’s shoulder, she only just kept herself from flinging him across the camp. “Forgivable Princess, but it is in the darkest hour that your wits will be most useful to you.” She wanted to retort, say something snarky, or claim that she had heard these lessons too many times before. But it wouldn’t have done much good. She was in no mood for a shouting match, and it wouldn’t look good for their alliance. She only bit her tongue and nodded, only too aware of the hand on her shoulder; these humans must have different sensibilities indeed. Had an elf touched a princess in such a way, his hand would have come off, regardless of rank or position. “Nevertheless,” the general continued “I think you should see this.” He waved towards the burning city.

She waited a few moments before replying through gritted teeth. “I have seen that very scene in my nightmares, general. I don’t want to keep seeing it while I am awake as well.”

As she faced him again, she realized that he had his hand raised high. Behind him, 4 groups of 5 human mages arranged themselves. Behind them were what appeared to be mortars \- dwarven technology – but on a far larger scale than what she had ever seen before, obviously augmented with magic. “Fire!” he cried out.

The mages performed a type of combined dance, weaving the natural energies between each other like a single artist painting on a canvas. Finally, in unison, all 20 mages fired the magic at the demons. Behind them, the mortars also fired together. She watched as all the shots arched over the hills and the forests hitting, not their city, but all the areas around it. Surprisingly, it would seem that the volley that should have had leveled the mountains themselves, did next to no damage. With the demon armies within still intact. “It seems you missed” jabbed Loriel before she could catch herself.

“Did we?” the general now grinned, an unnerving sight in itself. She looked back at the devastation.

The demonic armies swarmed out of the city towards their location, still some 10 miles away, but they would tread the distance in no time. Loriel’s hand reached to her bow.

Boom!

An explosion rang out as a pillar of lightning appeared in front of them. Consuming a large portion of the armies in front of them. Still they came, Boom! More explosions of lightning and ice and earth consumed the opposing armies as they came closer. Of course, that’s what the scout had been setting up. Magical traps need a power source. No magic could be cast inside the forest since that would alert the demons, so that first volley was the power source. And since it comes from below them, the demon’s sky defence could not protect them from damage from underground as it would have if they had aimed at them directly. Boom! Boom! Boom! trap after trap were springing, but the hordes still came in the tens of thousands.

“Rank two, Fire!” the general cried again. A cacophony of massive explosions from behind her indicated that cannons now fired. What sounded like thousands of cannons, echoing in the hills around them, fired from behind every hill top around them. The first few bounced off the magical barrier of the demons, but the sheer magnitude of iron shells soon overwhelmed their worlocks. After all it was easier to defend against magic than simple Iron balls after all. It wasn’t long before their numbers were slowly ripped apart by the simple cannonballs, then the explosive ones. The volley stopped “Rank two! Fire at Will!” The general cried out. Bit by bit, the demon’s ranks were obliterated, with no way of fighting back. Still, they started to close the distance quickly. It wouldn't be long now, she readied her bow.

But, a glimmer of armor caught her eye. From the corner of her eyes she realised what the larger plan was. Tens of thousands of infantry and horsemen started to encircle the demons. All the demon’s attention was focused on them, they didn’t or couldn’t see what was going on around them. The General baited them, and these demons took it like a rat in a cage. Even from here, she could see the battle was already over, only a few minutes after the first volley. “Cease fire!” The general cried out. The bombardment stopped.

the two human armies pincer the demonic hordes between them. The human infantry lines split the horde and held their ground, while the cavalry stormed the breaches and attacked them from the rear. Within an hour, the last remnants of the demons had been killed. The city was theirs again.

She couldn’t help but suppress a grin. She finally turned to this general, “Well then, Prince\-General Constantine, for someone who claims that victory and defeat are one and the same. You surprised me by how well you can win.”

He looked back at her through the corner of his eye and a sly smile on his face, “Coming from you that’s great praise.”

This time she grabbed his shoulder, returning the favor so as to speak, “Remind me never to enter a war with you against me.” He gave a slight bow before turning back to the battlefield, she was a bit irritated by his lack of acceptance of her praise. After a few moments, he turned to face her again, this time with a sadder look in his face. “I am very serious, Prince,” Loriel said “All elves of this land are in your debt, not only for saving the city, but also for causing so little damage to it. No matter what happens from here onward, but if ever you come back here, no matter what other business we may have with you or your people, you will be treated as a king.” He curtly thanked her, before walking away. These humans are impossible! She thought, “Constantine! Is something wrong? You should be proud! You have achieved a great victory today!”

He turned around. “I will celebrate later. Many people died here today, not as many as could be expected, but still very many. And the war has only just started. And remember that we can win every battle and still lose the war.”"

The Rise and Fall of the Republic of Italy (1576 - 1593),16,131,False,False,False,eu4,1527514164.0,True,"It is New Year’s Day, in the Year of Our Lord, 1576. Tens of thousands of people crowd the streets of Rome, to see the beginning of a new era in Italy.

For the past month Italy has been abuzz with activity and excitement as the Grand Consul of the Republic of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Alessandri, has toured the north on his way to Rome, visiting major towns and cities, waving to the crowds and embracing the land’s leading men; nobles and bishops and merchants. 

Not two weeks ago these same towns and cities had sent out loyal men to join the ranks of General Marcello Arborio Mella’s army as it stormed across Italy, crushing the combined forces of the Papal States, the Duchy of Urbino and the Swiss Republic, the last remaining enemies to Italian unification. But the war was won by the Republic of Milan, and now no one stands in the way of progress and greatness.

The ancient city of Rome was occupied by General Mella’s army in November of 1575, effectively bringing an end to the brief but bloody war. At the peace talks, Duke Guidantonio II of Urbino agreed to dissolve his alliance with the Kingdom of France, a staunch ally of Milan’s \(who had only sat out joining this war because of a war with Austria over the hotly contested Sundgau province in the Rhineland\), and the Swiss Republic dissolved their alliance with the Papal State and paid Milan a relatively small reparation.

The results of the war for the Papal State was far more severe. Ownership of the city of Rome and its surrounding farmlands was ceded to Milan, and Pope Innocentius IX departed the Vatican in outrage, making for his last remaining city in Italy \- Naples. Once he arrived there he promptly issued an excommunication bull against Grand Consul Alessandri, but this changed nothing. Rome was lost to him forever, and soon, as it turns out, would be Italy entirely, for in the next month the Kingdom of Naples declared war on the Pope, promptly retaking the city of Naples after it had been lost to them for half a century.

With all of his earthly possessions taken from him, the Pope fled Italy for the Imperial lands in Germany. The Emperor – Joseph II of Austria – was sympathetic to his plight and granted him the modest city of Loon in the Low Countries. The Pope, sullen but determined to continue his resistance against Milan if not by war then by word, moved his court to Loon, a tiny Catholic stronghold surrounded by the Protestant hordes on all sides.

And so it came to be that on the 1st of January 1576, Grand Consul Alessandri entered Rome in triumph, just as the Roman generals of the ancient world did, and greeted the crowd of tens of thousands assembled there. He embraced General Mella and as a reward for his invaluable service to the Republic granted him the title of ‘Head of the Armies of Italy’. Eschewing the trappings of monarchy that the Republic of Milan so vigorously resisted, the Grand Consul instead took on oath on the Bible to uphold the freedoms and dignity of the people of all of Italy, and to continue the fight to unify this country so long divided.

In the year 1576, the map of Europe was changed forever.

The next ten years saw a consistent growth in Italian prosperity and power. The army and navy were both enlarged considerably, more trade income was gathered from the Ligurian Sea and not just the Adriatic, and the Grand Consul gradually begun limiting the power of the estates by stripping away their land and privileges to centralise power in Italy more with the government in Rome rather than on a provincial level. A brief and successful war against the Republic of Lucca saw the annexation of the cities of Lucca and Pisa, further unifying the Republic of Italy.

But not all was as it should be. Away from the staunchly republican atmosphere of Milan, Grand Consul Alessandri gradually began indulging in more autocratic behaviour. He stopped consulting the Senate on matters of state and schemed so that he was given multiple terms in office rather than the customary one. At first very few complained, the immense popularity of the Consul still creating an aura of near\-divinity around him, but as the years went by people began to get more concerned.

It was in the year 1587, 11 years since the founding of the Republic of Italy, that things came to a head. A couple of days after the most recent election saw Alessandri elected near unanimously for Grand Consul yet again \(an election that not even the most naïve person believed to be free and genuine\), two dozen leading members of the Senate confronted Alessandri with an ultimatum: step down immediately as Grand Consul or you will be impeached.

The Grand Consul considered the document for a few moments and then tore it up right in front of them, before turning his back and calling for the guards. He ordered the arrest of these senators for treason, and the guards duly complied without a word of opposition.

News of this shocking encounter spread like wildfire through Rome, and the next day all pretensions were dropped. Grand Consul Alessandri appeared before the Senate – sans those senators that had been thrown in prison – and told them that as of this date – the 25th of April, 1587 – there would be no further elections and no further talk of replacing Alessandri, who promptly ditched the old title of Grand Consul and ordered them to refer to him as the Lord Protector of the Republic of Italy.

The two dozen senators locked in the dungeons below the Lord Protector’s palace were given a choice: publically acknowledge Alessandri as Lord Protector for life, or be executed for treason.

The election of Duke Václav V of Bohemia as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire the next year brought significant change to Italian\-Imperial relations. Formerly, with the Austrians holding Emperorship, things were incredibly tense, with the Republic of Milan siding with their ally France against the Austrians in several wars, and things got even more tense when Emperor Joseph II publically converted to Protestantism, giving in to pressure from the many Protestant princes surrounding him. He had failed to defeat the Protestant League in the 1570's and gave up on reasserting Catholicism in the Empire. There there genuine fears in Italy that Protestantism would spread to the peninsula, although the Grand Consuls were quick to stamp out any possible Protestant activity and keep Italy firmly Catholic.

A mere three days after Václav was elected Emperor, Lord Protector Alessandri began making overtures to the Bohemians in the hope of forming an alliance. As long\-time foes of the Austrians, the Bohemian Emperor was all too happy to form an alliance with Italy. This deeply concerned the Austrians, who were now surrounded to the north\-east and south\-west by long\-time enemies.

The death of General Mella in March of 1590 was mourned by all of the Italian Republic, with the Lord Protector giving him a hugely expensive and lavish state funeral and decreeing a week of public mourning. He then gave the deceased general the honourific posthumous title of ‘Hero of the Republic’. 

The next day Lord Protector Alessandri appointed himself Head of the Armies of Italy.

Beginning in October of the same year, the Lord Protector dramatically increased his efforts to strip the estates of their power and influence, sending government officials to formally acquire their assets and property. The first target were the merchants, who for decades had been funnelling trade income into their private businesses rather than state coffers. There were revolts all over Northern Italy, which the Lord Protector crushed with incredible brutality until no opposition remained and the central government was stronger than ever before. 

By July of 1591 no more land in the Republic of Italy was owned by any estate.

On the 5th of February, 1593, as the sun first rose over the mountains and lit up the fields around Rome with a dull golden glow, the corpse of Lord Protector Alessandri was found in his bed. He had been stabbed a dozen times, including once in the heart. His personal bodyguard was then found dead as well, the dozen corpses strewn about in the Tiber.

The people of Rome awoke, that morning, to a new man leading Italy – Lodovico Maria di Malaspina, a 20\-year\-old brazen young man from one of Milan’s oldest noble families, who had been plotting the downfall of Alessandri ever since he was 17 and the Lord Protector began stripping the estates of their influence and power. Lodovico was granted the support of the noble estate in exchange for him recognising their traditional and sacred rights and privileges. He agreed, and so they helped install him as king.

It was on the 5th of March, 1593, that from the Forum in the heart of the city, King Lodovico declared the Republic dissolved and the Kingdom of Italy established. In the following days marriage proposals were sent out to the major European powers and allies of Italy – France, Spain, Bohemia.

The era of the republic was over.

I hope you guys enjoyed reading this. You'll have to forgive the rather extreme length of this post; I've been a writer long before an EU4 player. I know these types of posts are pretty rare on here, but I thoroughly enjoyed playing and writing this, so why not? Of course I took quite a bit of artistic licence in parts \- mostly to add flavour, but all of it is based on things that actually happened in my current Milan \&gt; Italy game, such as forming Italy on 1st January 1576 as the Ambrosian Republic, being excommunicated, the Pope fleeing to the Low Countries, the republic becoming a dictatorship under its first ruler, the destruction of the estates and the transition from a dictatorship to a kingdom under King Lodovico on the 5th of February 1593."

Can I just say about blaming the Jews for everything...,239,139,False,False,False,conspiracy,1527512274.0,True,"Hey Everyone,

I think I need to take some time to drive home a fundamental truth. We are all human beings and are privvy to the same range of biases and emotions as every other human being.

The fact that there is a financial elite that are in control of media and craft messages to keep people confirming their own biases isn't because the subscribe to a particular religion or belong to a certain race. They are just bad human beings. 

It worries me immensely that the kind of circular logic where people think ""some rich humans are bad and they happen to be Jewish, therefore Jews are bad"" has arisen again and its exactly the same kind of logic Hitler used to develop his campaign and eventually the Nazi Party. 

We need to move back to understanding that its the actions of bad human beings in isolation if we are to evolve as a species and begin tackling the issues these bad human beings create effectively.

Peace.

EDIT: I'm really glad people can still have a discussion here. Some people are being unfair and a bit mean spirited in this thread but because this blew up I'm going to leave you with my favourite meme. I always use it to frame my thinking when it comes to human issues.

The sad reason I need more solo content: all my friends are gone.,784,6169,False,False,False,DestinyTheGame,1527461694.0,True,"I've noticed an uprising in posts regarding solo queueing in Crucible, and the need for improved matchmaking and other measures for solo PvE content.  I think something that needs to be talked about, that has so far been left out of the conversation, is *why* solo content is becoming so important.


I used to have an amazing raid group.  We formed at the start of TTK and we would reset raid every week.  We got to know each other really well and had a blast doing it.  There were plenty of shenanigans but we still managed to blast out 3x Oryx/Aksis in about 3-4 hours.  The rest of the week we'd hang out and play Crucible, Nightfalls, etc.  They were legitimate friends, even though it was over the online medium.


They're all gone now, *all* of them.  My friends list (for people playing Destiny) is a barren wasteland.  When I ask if they want to play, most are so jaded the response is something like ""screw that shitty game.""  Or, they ask me, ""why are you still playing Destiny?"" with complete incredulity.


This has left me with 2 main feelings about group play in D2.  First, I am less interested in joining a new clan or making a whole new set of friends, for the few times I have tried, those people have ended up disappearing too, and it totally sucks.  Second, as the population drops, LFG has become more toxic and I just don't have the time to grind prestige Calus 50x just to be invited into a group.


So, I need solo content.  I need matchmaking.  I want to play the game just to relax and get some stress out, and get some decent loot in the process.  But it seems like Bungie is still designing activities around the old population numbers and player base.  Escalation Protocol is a perfect example - with my old group I'd be happy to team up with 2 others and discuss tactics and coordinate weapons/roles and all that.  Now, I just would like to load into a zone and be able to complete it with a group of randoms, because it's just not as fun to try to mesh play styles with an LFG stranger.


So, the point of this, is that if anyone from Bungie sees this, I would appreciate if you started to develop more content towards solo players, because that seems to be the majority of who are left at this point.  I think people will return for the fall DLC, but I fear so many parts of the game are fundamentally broken (atmosphere, tone, abilities, the feel of weapons, loot, etc) that we'll never be at D1 levels of engagement.  That isn't necessarily a terrible thing, it just means Bungie needs to know who their audience *is*, instead of who they should be.

Walker's French Frys - then and now. A review of 9 year old crisps,16,92,False,False,False,CasualUK,1527527479.0,True,"A couple of weeks ago u/dokky found a load of Walkers French Fries that were [nearly 9 years out of date](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8ju3dd/found_half_a_box_of_these_anyone_hungry/), I asked for a pack and he delivered!

So I bought some modern ones and did a comparison. Unfortunately I could only find them in a multipack so have a smaller pack than individually sold ones \(multipack 18g vs 21g for a modern individual pack vs 22g for the old individual pack\).

[Front of pack](https://i.imgur.com/0bEgLhY.jpg)

[Back of pack](https://i.imgur.com/6OKSQo2.jpg?1)

[Crisp comparison](https://i.imgur.com/E6o5LEf.jpg)

**Packaging**

The packaging has been given a revamp, with a new font that looks more like the contents. The new packaging has no mention of Sunseed oil, so I guess Walkers have dumped the branded oil though continue to use sunflower oil. The older one looks to have been following a relatively recent reformulation as it talks about having 45&amp;#37; less salt \(than in 2005\) and 80&amp;#37; less saturated fat \(than in 2006\).

The packaging overall looks less cluttered on the new one, the health focus is less on the saturated fat content and more on having only 79 calories a bag and no artificial colours. The newer packaging also includes allergy advice which is missing on the 2009 version.

The newer bag has been printed at a higher resolution.

**Nutrition**

The new version apparently has more calories \(438 vs 430 per 100g\), however the gram amounts of the contents remain the same \(except salt, which has been reduced from 2.34 to 2.30g per 100g\). Ingredients more or less the same, though wheat flour and malic acid have been dropped from the flavouring recipe.

**Taste**

It will come as no surprise that crisps nearly 9 years past their best before date are past their best. They appear to be edible, you could eat them in a zombie apocalypse but they aren't good. There is no longer really a salt and vinegar flavour just a faint flavour of something not good and they have gone stale. The modern version taste as I remember them tasting in 1997.

Overall I recommend buying a new packet rather than eating ones nearly a decade past their best before date, even though they have 8 more calories per 100g. However, they are also virtually impossible to find not in a mixed flavour multi\-pack so unfortunately those of us who loathe cheese and onion will continue to miss out.

Edit: removed a word to make a sentence make sense."

"(Discussion) Let The Games Begin: Tesla Running New ""Dutch Auction"" Strategy for CPO Sales",18,56,False,False,False,teslamotors,1527527229.0,True,"Hello all, CPO Hunter here, sharing an interesting observation that's changing the CPO game as we head into summer.

The past year or so has seen a lot of interesting behavior in how Tesla handles CPO sales.

For the first while if its existence, the CPO program was seen a as a good way to get a reasonable deal on a used but fully reconditioned Tesla vehicle, with a four year warranty to back it up.  The deals available got even sweeter for some lower end consumers when Tesla expanded its CPO program to vehicles over 50,000 miles, albeit with half the warranty.  The beginning of the ""2 year CPO"" offerings saw some of the lowest CPO prices ever recorded, with lucky buyers being able to get into a fully reconditioned Model S in the high $30,000 range.

Then Tesla did a complete 180.  The CPO program was basically soft\-cancelled, as Tesla decided to hold back units to build out its rental fleet.  What CPOs did remain were priced so outrageously that it was hard not to argue Tesla was just trying to steer you into a new 75D instead of buying used.

However, as of this month \(May 2018\), the CPO program is back, with an aggressive new Dutch Auction pricing strategy.  For those not familiar with the term, a Dutch Auction is one in which the price starts very high, but is lowered rapidly until a buyer emerges.  Tesla (and any car lot for that matter) has used this strategy to an extent since day one; cars that sat too long in the CPO program would eventually see price decreases, usually after several weeks.  However what we are seeing now is a completely different thing.

Tesla is dropping prices on many CPOs by **several hundred dollars per day every day**.  As a result, sharp\-eyed CPO hunters are using CPO tracking alerts to stay updated on cars that match their interest profile, and then swooping in when the price reaches their desired level.  This creates interesting disparities:

[Model S 60, 41k miles, pre\-AutoPilot: currently $60,300: ](https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJSA1S19FFP77076?redirect=no)

Compare with P66139, a P85D \(!!\), 39k miles with Autopilot, sold for $59,700!

Now let's look at the price history for that bargain P85D:

|5/20/18|$59,700|
|:-|:-|
|5/19/18|$60,300|
|5/17/18|$60,900|
|5/16/18|$61,500|
|5/15/18|$62,100|
|.....|....|
|5/6/18|$67,600 \(beginning dutch auction price\)|

Who knows how low this car would have gotten had someone not swooped it up?  There will be deals to be had in the coming days for consumers who pay attention.

Happy hunting!

Yesterday we had another great C&amp;C event. Compared to last year's C&amp;C, this time there were twice as many cars and 20 times more people. Coastal city and sunny weather on a Sunday attract a crowd. I've gathered some of the more interesting or nice photos in this album.

The experience of seeing and hearing those machines was once again amazing, I hope you enjoy the photos at least a little. :) I'm also up for any photo critique you have, as I'd like to improve as a photographer. :)"

You probably haven't as it gets overshadowed by everything. In fact, most people don't even know it has new sounds as they are so quiet. In fact, when implementing in game they probably didn't know as it doesn't get a new sound or ability effects when viewing the skin in the menu. Although this is not important, I just hate how unlike the other skins, I can never hear Mariachi's sound in game.

We were sent to investigate an obscure drilling rig in the desert,29,335,False,False,False,nosleep,1527487635.0,True,"To make my introduction incredibly simple… I used to work for the US government. I say ‘used to’ because I really don’t know what’s going to happen to me now. 

Now, I didn’t have a glitzy office job or anything. I was more of a field agent. Military, if you will. But not quite. I’m not going to go into the intricacies of which branch I specifically worked for and what I did, exactly. That’s irrelevant, and in all honesty, you probably wouldn’t really want to know. 

Well… I doubt if you’ll really want to know *this* either. But I feel as if it’s pertinent that this story gets out. We’re dealing with something that nobody here quite understands. And we’re the ones that are supposed to understand everything. 

You see, there’s a drilling rig located somewhere in the Kalahari Desert. You’re not supposed to know about it. In fact, it’s so deep in the middle of nowhere that nobody could feasibly stumble upon it. Hell, I barely knew shit about it when I was first called up for the mission. The only information that I really had regarding the place was that the FBI had started an investigation into it back in June 2013, after discovering that some kind of anomalous event had occurred within the vicinity. That's all I had going into this. 

Here was the rundown of what we were told beyond that:

It was a hostage situation. A few workers had gone crazy and were holding the other employees there at gunpoint. They didn’t list any explicit reason for this, so the assumption was that they’d fallen victim to some kind of desert madness.

Or at least… this is what **we** were told. 

Anyhow, our job was to go in there and defuse the situation. We were supposed to try our best to not kill anybody. The key word there was “try”. No guarantees here. Now, any old SWAT team probably could’ve handled a situation like this. I mean, we were essentially dealing with petroleum engineers, not a trained militia. However, this place was so confidential that any non-essential personnel were to be absolutely barred from any knowledge that it existed. I suppose that we barely made the cut regarding who was ‘essential’ or not.


In retrospect, I should’ve asked more questions. Questions like why they were being so secretive about this place and why we needed 36 men go undertake what one small squadron would surely be capable of doing. 

Truth is… after a while you stop caring. But that all changed this time. This isn’t something that you can just write off. 

We flew out there in a fleet of 3 aircrafts, split into 12 people each. The only people that I’d recognized on mine were Klaus and Buchanan. We’d worked with each other before. Every other face was a stranger to me, but that didn’t really matter all too much. All that mattered was getting in, finishing the job and getting out as fast as possible. That’s all that ever mattered. 

The journey itself took quite a while, but that was expected. What I saw when we got there though… not so much. 

The rig itself and the surrounding buildings weren’t anything spectacular on the surface. The part that made no sense to anybody was the fact that it was located on the edge of a huge-ass cliff. Buchanan put it perfectly: 

“Kinda defeats the purpose of a rig, doesn’t it?”

When we landed, it became apparent that the place actually extended down into the cliff via stairs, ladders, elevators and tunnels. The entrance was essentially a small, gated building that provided access to the first set of stairs.

The plan was to go like this:

Since the place was too tight for 36 people to enter at once, we were going to be split into 3 groups of 12.  If the first group ran into trouble, they’d send down the second. If that failed, then the last group would have to step in. So ideally, the 2nd and 3rd groups wouldn’t even be necessary. They were just there as a fail-safe of sorts. I was part of the 2nd.

Now, I’ll be honest, I wasn’t really taking this whole thing too seriously at that point. I mean, we were dealing with some batshit workers who presumably only had access to basic weaponry. Besides, I was pretty sure that if the perpetrators got a bit too rowdy, the first group would just end up wasting them, possibly at the expense of a few innocents being injured. In other words, they weren’t going to need us. 

Evidently, some of the guys in my squadron felt the same way. Klaus even found a fridge with some beers in one of the surrounding cabins, and we finished them off while our supervisors weren’t looking. 

But after about two hours of dicking around, we were informed that we needed to head down. 

Most of us stood there in disbelief for a while. The supervisors were forced to bark at us a couple of times in order to stir a reaction. 

We eventually complied. I mean, we had to. However, the implications of the fact that *12 trained men armed to the teeth* couldn’t finish the job were undoubtedly weighing down on us. I mean, we were pretty much expendables going into an unknown situation. 

Suddenly, I was glad that we had those few beers to keep our nerves in check. 

As we got to the mouth of the entrance, one of our supervisors (I think his name was Richter), swung open the large, metal gate that was guarding the place. 

We all poured into the structure and found ourselves standing in what appeared to be a reception area. It was a small space, with a few desks and filing cabinets along with a singular, metal vault-like barrier. Richter walked up to it and entered a code into the panel beside it.

It opened up and we were suddenly faced with blackness. We all flicked on our rifle lights and descended the steps. From what I could tell, there seemed to be lightbulbs above but I guess they weren’t working for whatever reason. The steps themselves branched off quite a bit, I’d estimate probably once every 50 meters. However, we never went anywhere but straight. Richter just told us to keep going down. 

After what might’ve been twenty minutes, we finally reached what appeared to be some kind of mixture between a lab and a control room. There were monitors and scientific instruments set up in a relatively haphazard manner across the large, rectangular space. However, there *were* lights here, so I let my breathing loosen a bit. I never really liked the dark too much. 

Richter told us be quiet as he moved towards a door near the back of the room, almost as if he were listening *intently* for something. However… there was nothing to be heard. It was sheer silence. 

I could tell that Richter’s expression had plummeted when he looked back at us. He motioned us over, towards the door and whispered: “Keep your guard up”. 

With an extreme sensation of reservation filling the air around us, we all just followed his orders. Ever so slowly, he started opening the door. Now, I should’ve expected what we were about to see. I should’ve been expecting *anything*. But I still couldn’t stop myself from gagging a little. I’d seen death before, but not like this. 

The entirety of the first team was lying there limp, chaotically dispersed across the white floors of the hallway. It was an absolute gory mess. It was *strange* as well. The bullet holes on their bodies seemed too large. Like they were the result of a 50. Cal sniper. But who’d be sniping in such close proximity? 

At this point, it was safe to assume that we weren’t simply dealing with rig employees. Our superiors had either lied to us or were out of the loop themselves. I was leaning towards the former. Wouldn’t be the first time that it’d happened. 

Richter held up his hand, signaling for us to halt. In all honesty, I couldn’t be too mad at him. He also looked terrified. 

After a moment of excruciating hesitation, he finally motioned for us to enter the hallway. I suppose that we still had a job to do, after all. 

We moved with absolute caution, making minimal noise and trying not to disrupt the bodies. Just like the staircase, the hallway branched off quite a bit, but we always just went straight. Eventually, we reached a larger, rusted metal door at the end. It was marked by large, red letters:

**INSPECTION ZONE: MAXIMUM CLEARANCE NEEDED**

There was another panel to the side of it, which also included what looked like a fingerprint scanner. We all looked at Richter, trying to anticipate what the hell our next move was going to be. 

After what felt like an eternity, he finally walked up to it, entered a password, and scanned his thumb. We started to brace for whatever was coming.

However… I don’t think we could’ve ever been prepared for what was waiting for us on the other side. A deafening alarm accompanied by flashing red lights washed over us as the metal barrier began sliding open. It was a massacre that followed. 

A barrage of ammunition started decimating our group. But since I was near the back, I didn't get the full brunt of the assault. However, there was no way in hell that I was going to try returning fire. That would've been futile. I got a brief glimpse of who was firing at us before turning around and bolting.

I could only assume that they were some kind of infantry unit… from a place far more technologically advanced than here. They had on what appeared to be shiny grey exo-suits that followed their every moment with precision. Their weapons were also something else, barely yielding any recoil as they tore through their targets.

Motivated by the sounds of carnage, I just ran the other way. I knew that going straight wasn’t an option, so I ducked into the first branched pathway that I came across. I started weaving my way around the maze of corridors, trying to get away from whatever the hell was going on. 

The gunshots have long since ceased, and at that point, my footsteps were the only audible sounds. I didn't know where I was, but at least I was still alive. I stopped and leaned against a wall, trying to catch my breath. I nearly had a heart attack when I felt a metal hand cover my mouth and pull me into a corner. 

*It was one of those soldiers*. The guy came from nowhere. I instinctively put my hands up in a “please don’t kill me” position. After a few seconds, the soldier pressed a button and his helmet retracted into the suit, revealing his face. 

We just looked at each other for what felt like an eternity. His face was blank, with a hint of subtle surprise accentuating his expression. It felt weird at first but… he almost looked *familiar* somehow. After an indeterminate amount of silence, he chuckled. 

“Never thought I’d get this chance…”

After I let the initial shock wear off, I try pestering him with questions, but the words all stumbled out in a incoherent mess. 

“It’s alright.” He stops me. “It’s a long story, but I’ll explain everything.” 

He looks around before continuing. “Hopefully we have enough time.” 

What he ends up telling me puts me into a state of absolute incredulity. 

As it turns out, the soldiers that just mowed us down had come here from the future. 2143, to be exact. Yes, we were dealing with time travel here. Look, I don’t want to believe it either, but it is what it is. They’d been sent back for the sole purpose of making sure nobody made it past the inspection zone. 

*So what was beyond that point?*

“Something primal… something that was never meant to be disturbed.” The soldier tells me. “There’s a bunch of theories about how it got there, but all of them lead to the same conclusion. We cannot fuck with it.” 

He tells me that once we started digging into the Cliffside in an attempt to find out what was going on, we ruined the future for everybody. *We unleashed this thing*. 

The soldier sighs, before taking a seat. “But you weren’t the only ones that fucked up. We did too.” 

Apparently, during the chaotic aftermath of whatever we’d released to the world, the quest to perfect time travel was forced to be expedited. They needed to erase this event *immediately*. That meant cutting some corners. The first team - which consisted of around fifteen people, was supposed to be sent back to the winter of 2014 – the actual time during which we supposedly started constructing the rig. They wanted to end it before it started. However… the technology was simply not ready yet. 

Instead, they were accidentally dropped around June in 2013.

*Wait*. 2013 June. That’s when this whole thing started. *It wasn’t the winter of 2014*. 

I looked up at the solider, and he just nodded, as if he knew that I’d just connected the dots. 

“So you can see where we catastrophically messed everything up, right?” 

I needed to think about it some more. *It couldn’t be, right?* 

Apparently, when the first team of 15 were sent back, they triggered something. It might’ve been some sort of seismic event or unnatural spike in radiation that caught the attention of the US government. In addition to this, the pod that was supposed to contain their water and rations had been dropped nearly 400 miles away from where they were. In short, all of them died in the desert before they could even warn anybody about this. 

In their attempt to stop people from discovering the monstrosity located within the Cliffside, they were the ones that caused them to *look for it in the first place.* 

“Predestination.” I found myself whispering. The soldier simply nodded. “We created some kind of fucked up self-fulfilling prophecy. It doesn’t really make a lot of sense to me, but I’m irrelevant here. I didn’t help design that goddamned time machine.” 

“So what the hell did we release?” I ask him. “What’re you guys trying to protect?""

He chuckles again, although a sneer would probably be a more apt description of the sound he made. “We weren’t trying to protect that fucking thing down there. We were trying to protect humanity. We need that thing to remain dormant for *as long as possible.* There’s nothing we can do if it wakes up naturally, but we sure as hell can’t be the ones that cause it.” 

I still don’t quite understand what I’m hearing, but it doesn’t stop me from pressing him further.

“So why are you guys here now? It’s 2018, did the machine fuck up again?” 

The solider nods. “We couldn’t risk another mission landing before the discovery, so we needed to make sure that we were sent back at some point afterwards. As it turns out, that ended up being a few days ago. We still couldn't control when exactly we landed, so this is what we got.”

“So what the hell are you supposed to do now?” I asked him. 

He looks up at me, with an expression that I can only describe as sheer disconcertion on his face. 

“We kill everybody that comes here. That included the employees, and whoever’s sent here to investigate.” 

My heart drops a bit. I feel anger rising in my system for just a second, before ultimately realizing why this may be necessary. A hundred lives taken today is worth saving humanity in the long run. 

“You guys are close.” He says. “Close to drilling into the beast’s lair. We have no time to try and convince you to stop. There’s only 15 of us, after all. In our timeline, you guys initially disrupted this thing at the end of this year. You saw the sheer scale of this creature and decided not to provoke it any further. However, by that time it was too late. This thing reacts rather slowly, but the results are always apocalyptic in the end. It woke up 124 years later to find a massive hole that led to the outside world. And then it escaped.” 

He lets out an exasperated exhale before continuing. “We have no time. There’s no time.” 

I’m cautious as I ask the next question, not really knowing where it’ll lead me. “So why didn’t you kill me? Isn't that the job?” 

He looks at me again. This time, we hold each other’s gaze for what feels like an extended period of time. His eyes were so… *familiar*. I realized why that was the case later on, but it felt so strange at the time. 

Eventually, he reaches into his pocket and takes out a Polaroid picture, sliding it towards me. I pick it up, and flinch in surprise at what I’m seeing. 

It’s… *me*. Holding a baby. I don’t recall ever posing for this picture. Also, I’m about 28 now, but looked to be in my mid 30’s in the photo.

I stare back at him, expecting some sort of an explanation. He just chuckles again. “Nobody in our family ever blamed you for what happened. The ancestors of everybody involved here always felt the greatest extent of shame, but we never did. We knew that you were just following orders. We knew that you never could’ve realized what you were actually doing.” 

As I take the time to process this weighty revelation, the soldier gets up. “Besides, if I kill you here, then I won’t exist in the future. It’s kind of a selfish reason that I’m doing this, I suppose. But hey, we gotta do what we’ve gotta do to survive.” 

“So what’d you want me to do now?” I ask him. The question nearly chokes me up. I can barely handle what I’m being told right now.  

“Find a way out of here. There’s staircases everywhere. Each one of them lead up to the surface. Once you get there, you can and try and tell everybody about what I’ve told you here, but they won’t believe you. So just forget about this."" 

I suppose that I must’ve looked horrified, because the Solider simply chuckled again. “Don’t worry about it. We have a plan, and I’m confident it’ll work. We just need to hold you guys off for a few more days.” 

He gives me a smile before activating his helmet again. He starts walking before turning back one last time. “I would’ve told you more, but I didn’t want to spoil everything for you. You should quit smoking, though.”

After he left, I must’ve stood there for hours. I mean, *what the fuck just happened?* Eventually, I make my way back up the surface. I tell the other supervisors exactly what had transpired, but they just looked like as if I were completely fucking insane. A reasonable reaction, in retrospect. 

Not long after, they send the 3rd team down. I hear later that they didn’t make a dent on soldiers from the future. Good news, I guess. Later that day, I’m flown back to the states and questioned extensively. I just tell them the same thing that I told the supervisors. I even show them the picture that the soldier gave me. The higher-ups who question me simply write it all off as me being mad. 

I’m on paid leave for now. I’m not sure when they’ll decide to bring me back. In fact, I don’t even know if they’re considering bringing me back at all. 

Whatever. *I just need to forget about all of this.* I just want to believe that everything the soldier told me was bullshit. 

*But why would it be?* Why would he go through the process of making it all up just to fuck with me? This all seems to lead to one conclusion. And it's not a good one. 

When the solider told me that he was confident in their plan to save humanity, there was something off about the way that he'd said it. Something that told me he wasn't actually confident about it at all.

*We may be in real danger here*.

On the flipside, Hordes were rather large, somewhat common (like 15 zombies large once the game stops babying you about 5-10 days in), and hordes would sometimes be 'screamer hordes' which would infest buildings.

This created a pretty tense atmosphere, as you would often find yourself sneaking around these hordes, especially in Marshall, and most Special Zombies had the ability to roar and alert hordes. Infestations were a huge problem for two reason: 1: they spawned more infestations, and 2: they spawned more hordes. Unfortunately the Outpost Mines mechanic totally fucked this system over and didn't let it shine, but it was a great system nontheless, the zombies had an 'ecosystem' of sorts.

TL:DR SOD 1 had it the right way. Instead of an annoying constant trickle you had the *occasional* ambient OR a huge fucking horde.

To everybody complainning about Saryn: Give Pablo a break.,97,137,False,False,False,Warframe,1527519499.0,True,"I'm gonna be honest with ya'll, I don't know how to address this issue without being downvoted to the void and back, so I'm just gonna speak my mind.

First of all, no she's not perfect but then again nothing is. That out of the way:

Games are supposed to be challenging. You can't seriously expect the Saryn 3.0 to remain as she was since you could literally throw spores out once and then AFK. DE has already stated how they feel about that sort of playstyle and the changes are reflective of that. Plus, if anything, they've improved the state of saryn a lot by not punishing you with removing all of the stacks you got, yet people keep complainning that spores don't spread on death by AFKing or that now saryn is an energy hog (like all bloody frames but a counted few, and still).

Sure, DE has gotten to where they're at by listening to community feedback, but one thing is to listen to community feedback and take action accordingly; and another is to bend to the will of people who want to do whatever they want only. There HAS to be a compromise.

If that compromise is that the game should not be a ""press one button and win"" simulator according to the official stand of DE, then manage your expectations accordingly. If the objective is to be more engaged with the game, I can't see why that's a bad thing. That's why most people play games primarily.

And bloody hell, don't take Pablo's tweets as a way to disrespect the playerbase. I don't enjoy playing Nyx so I don't play her. Different frames for different people. How is it that the design philosophy of warframe is now somehow anti-consumer? From DE? Anti-consumer statements? Did you just come here from Battlefront 2? Jesus christ dude. I guess the only reasonable thing now is to have DE do ""Work for Hire"" for their entire playerbase, catering to the loud vocal members of the community who can't see past themselves.

I'm not sorry. Chill the fuck out about the Saryn 3.5 state and at least TRY to put yourselves in the shoes of the developers. Then the conversation can actually move forward to better things for everybody."

"Yes, You Can Do These Things in Dreams! [Huge List] [PS4 Exclusive, 2018]",32,45,False,False,False,PS4,1527531491.0,True,"I will start by saying that this list was not made by me, but found over at [Dreambubble.me](https://dreambubble.me/), source:

[https://dreambubble.me/forums/threads/yes\-you\-can\-do\-these\-things\-in\-dreams\-round\-up.1108/](https://dreambubble.me/forums/threads/yes-you-can-do-these-things-in-dreams-round-up.1108/)

[ Go visit Dreambubble.me, fansite dedicated to Dreams : \)](https://i.redd.it/xbls633q1n011.jpg)

So here we go, **keep in mind that this list was made some time ago** \(Dec 19, 2017\) so there possibly some additions to the list:

# General

**DLC:**

* DLC for Dreams will be a thing but it will depends on how people use the game. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941050668692860928)

**Exporting:**

* There are current plans where you can print out your creations from Dreams onto a 3D printer! [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/939611728198995969)
* *In regards to exporting videos to PC \-* They are relying on platform features like share button, streaming, video record, share factory, etc for video export! [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941630147614117889)

**Hardware:**

* *Regarding PlayStation 4 Pro support* \- Yes it supports Pro! Dreams will support 4k output or 'arcade mode' \(higher frame rate\) at 1080p, it's a similar improvement to almost all Playstation games. However you can do everything on a regular Playstation 4! [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/RbdJellyfish/status/939496687361560577) [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940145083541626881)
* *Regarding Frame Rate in Dreams* \- Dreams go to 60FPS if it can, for a lot of big arty levels we target 30. Playstation 4 Pro increases the number of levels that make it to 60! Locking FPS at 30 may be added in at a later date. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940554185816395776)

**Controls:**

* Regarding the control scheme of controlling the imp: With the Dualshock 4, the depth is automatic when grabbing. When creating it depends on your guides, eg surface snap on or off. Left stick pulls and pushes in depth. Feels nice! [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940562463329804288)

# DreamSurfing

**General:**

* *Regarding amount of people you can play with* \- The story in Dreams can be played by up to two players max online and couch co\-op. However, the maximum numbers of players that can play a dream made by yourself or the community can be up to 4 players couch co\-op or online! Online with be post\-launch. \[LINK\]
* *Regarding Scoreboards* \- They will probably be out with the multiplayer update, but you can make your own with the built\-in level scoring hud tools in create. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940338482546905089)

# DreamShaping

**General:**

* *Regarding file\-sizes for creating your Dreams \-* Dreams are tiny \(a few megs max\), can be saved online, and each game is only allowed 1gb save data anyway \(system software rules\). So dreams will not fill your hard drive. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/942394004179701762)
* *Regarding connecting dreams seamlessly* \- You are able to seamlessly connect other dreams with subtle loading times. The next level is streamed as you play, so the load time can be instant. \(Example given in the question: If you build a map with a cave, you can enter and exit that cave freely.\) [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/matthewDmeyer/status/942429668312891392) [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940365053160648704)
* *Regarding saving data in a Dream* \- You can save progress within a map, so you can unlock stages and come back to it. we dont currently store progress within levels. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940552259083165696)
* There is no height limit while creating a Dream, the thermometer is about complexity \- not size!
* Your Dream can be fully localized including voice overs, the language the PS4 is in will trigger the right version! [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941425825307557889)

**Maps:**

* You can have multiple stories be interwoven. The autosurf feature takes 3 \(i think\) community maps and interleaves their levels but preserves their order. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941047122924843008)

**User Interface:**

* You can configure where you want the UI Palette to go. For Dualshock 4 it defaults top, for two handed move it goes on your secondary hand. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940557155740147713)
* All the tools in the UI Palette will be titled eventually [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940636703735406594).
* You can easily create UI such as a pause menu, health bars, etc. It may also get easier! [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941598176355782656)

**Gameplay:**

* You can decide how much damage a weapon does, if a character's health should regenerate or not, as well as create Ammo and pickups too! [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/teska77/status/940423347632050177)
* You can make your own turn\-based game in Dreams. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940553124628062210)
* You can go back &amp; forth between dream levels. So say you get a key in dream 2 that unlocks a door that was in dream 1, you can go back and unlock it. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940739146716499976)
* You can make spherical gameplay by turning gravity off and using some Gadgets to emulate it. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/BogdanVera/status/941048570844733440)
* You can make First Person view kinds of creation by just sticking a camera to a character. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941050309266345984)
* With a bit of trickery you can make a true 2D game like Megaman or Super Mario Bros. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941056825629257729)

**Music/Sound:**

* To input audio you can use any mic supported by the Playstation 4. You can also use 'second screen' \(phone, tablet, laptop,...\) to import sound via a web app. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941162472123371520)
* You can import audio via a webapp where you use webaudio to record from a mic live or drag drop any audio file your browser supports. from there you can trim, crop, normalize, fade, prepare to taste"". [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941802998577188864)
* It is possible to use the music creation tools with the PS move controllers or with another player so you can jam together. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941703130152079361)
* You can change the temp of the music with keyframes and animate it. Can also use the same technique to adjust player movement speed, health and more. \- [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/943174601487605760) [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/edhargrave/status/943216877576310784)

**Animation:**

* You could animate a character to swim manually using logic. so possible but not for beginner creators. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/940739464732782592)
* Dreams has the option where you can use skeleton and rigs to animate your characters. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941055848801071104)
* You can pose things such as characters and animate that way. [\[LINK\]](https://twitter.com/mmalex/status/941056740669485063)

**Visuals**:

* *Whether we can make completely two dimensional sprites to sticker panel in LittleBigPlanet 3* \- Yes we can. One way is to turn off the sun and make the sky a flat colour which will cause any flat object to appear 'unlit' \(uniformly lit\).

So I thought I'd give it a shot if anyone has anything to add or if anything is incorrect mention it and I will amend it.  

I won't be going into huge detail on things like weapon mechanics and abilities for now as they require a much more in-depth discussion in their own right. So I'll just talk about base mechanics and some of the more obfuscated information in the game that's important.

___

##**Slayer's Tools:**


+ **Flare** - (*LT or C*) Fire a flare up in the air creating a beacon for your other hunters to find you. This can be seen by your allies both in the world and it will linger on their compass for a short duration.  This is important to use so your allies may quickly assemble when the behemoth has been located if you notice someone is missing during a fight they may be lost. So throw up a flare so they can more easily find you. 

+ **Lantern** - (*LB or V*) There are a variety of lanterns with a variety of skills. The lanterns charge can be seen in the top left of the screen in 2 forms, a glowing bar and a small bar with a number. The base lantern only has 1 skill which is to point you vaguely in the direction of the behemoth on the map with particles moving toward it. However, later lanterns will have 2 skills, a combat skill and a utility skill which can be activated with a long and short press of the lantern key . The large bar represents the combat skill and the numbered bar the utility. Lanterns are primarily charged by hitting behemoths, but they are also charged by using an Aether vent or running into an Aether wisp

+ **Healing Potions** - (*Dpad up or 1*) You are provided 5 of these for the duration of a quest, any extras at the end of the quest will be lost and cannot be carried over to other quests. 

+ **Supplies** - (*Dpad left, right and down or 2, 3, 4*) You can bring up to 3 utility supply items per quest. Unlike potions, these are crafted by you and brought from your own supply and equipped in the loadout. These have a great variety from offensive, to defensive or pure utility. 

___

##**World Objects:**


+ **Aether Wisps** - Aether wisps give you a boost of energy! increasing movement speed for a duration and recharging your lantern slightly. 

+ **Aether Vent** - A rift in the ground emitting blue light. These have 5 charges shared among all the hunters in a group. They can be interacted with to consume a charge to heal a moderate amount and give a small amount of lantern charge. They will only spawn in the location where the behemoth currently is and will disappear on depletion. They will not respawn unless the behemoth moves back to that location at a later time in the fight. This means that they can be used as an indicator as to where the behemoth currently is if it is one of the harder to notice at a glance behemoths.

+ **Aether updrafts** - These circular holes in the ground gushing energy will launch you in the direction they are facing on moving onto them. This will primarily be used to traverse large cliffs or get across large chasms whilst navigating the islands. 

+ **Ingredients nodes** - Flowers, mushrooms, and minerals. These objects are used to craft utility items and will spawn in set locations around the islands. It is somewhat important to gather these as you go and remember the locations of important materials for expedient gathering. However, it is worth noting that the amount of nodes present in any given cluster is randomized so yields may vary. 

+ **Aether Flame** - Glowling orange balls produced by Hellion. If you run through them you gain fire immunity, movement speed and attack speed for a short duration per flame collected. Although make sure to distribute them as evenly as possible so everyone can deal with the lava.

___


##**Damage types:**


+ **Basic** - Green - Damage done to the behemoths main health pool only.


+ **Part** - Yellow -  Damage done to both the behemoths main health pool and part health, on depleting the parts health it will break 
often yielding drops and staggering the behemoth 

+ **Stagger** - Blue - Concussive damage that can be done to the head or limbs of a behemoth, not affecting main health pool. once reaching a certain point the behemoth will be staggered identified by bubbles coming from it's head. If further stagger damage is applied while the behemoth is staggered it will result in a knockdown. Primarily done by Hammer and Axe


+ **Wound** - Red - Opens wounds on parts of the behemoth but does not damage the main health pool. Will open blue aether nodes on parts, these will increase part damage dealt to the location. Once a part has been wounded or broken no further wound damage may be done.  Primarily War Pike

___

##**Elements:**

Weapons made from elementally charged behemoths do elemental damage increasing their strength vs certain behemoths (+40) and weakening vs others (-20). However, if enough damage is done to a behemoth with a certain element they will eventually be afflicted by it giving them a debuff for a period of time. 


+ **Blaze** - Causes burning damage over time to the behemoth, indicated by them being on fire.


+ **Frost** - Causes Slowed behemoth movement and animation speed


+ **Shock** - Causes the behemoth to be paralyzed for a short duration

+ **Umbral** - Shrowd does not afflict the behemoth. *?
 
+ **Radiant** - Radiant does not afflict the behemoth *?

Worth noting, the behemoths weaknesses can be checked before going on a quest by the symbols under their icon.


## **Debuffs:**

+ **Burning** - Flame - Damage over time, cleansed by rolling


+ **Shocked** - Lightning bolt - Unable to interact, this includes; using potions, using utility items, using the aether vent, and resurrecting other players


+ **Frozen** - iceberg - Locked in place, cleansed by being hit by another player (skarn lantern will also free you)

+ **Wounded** - Broken Heart - Next attack taken will cause a burst of damage and hitting 0 Stamina causes a burst of damage, debuff is removed on activation. Cleansed on healing, using a vent or potion

+ **Swarm** - Bees! - Covered in insects, slowing movement, cleansed by attacking the bees, you can also attack other players bees to cleanse them faster. Higher versions cause damage over time

+ **Corruption**  - Deals damage over time while also slowing you down, and can be cleansed by striking Shrowd or his Shadowclone/Doomsday Orb with your weapon. 


___
##**Resistances:**
Your base resistance is your main defense stat for most behemoth attacks. However gear will also sometime provide elemental resistance and weaknesses. These apply to the specific aether infused attacks of the various behemoths.

+ Blaze  - Fire damage such as Embermane's fireballs, Charogg's lava and Hellion's Lava

+ Frost - Ice damage such as Skraev's ice shards, Panagar's ice shards
 
+ Shock - Electrical Damage such as  Drask's Lightning blast, Nayzaga's Lightning bolts/balls and Stormclaws Lightning balls and cloud strikes


___


##**Interrupts:**

Interrupts or Boops (as they are often called) are when a monster is knocked down by hitting it with an attack whilst it does certain actions and often need to be hit in specific locations. This can be done by all weapons but chain blades and is easiest to execute with hammer shot or warpike shot due to their range. 

+ **Embermane**: Charges

+ **Skarn**:  Whirlwind spin and when standing (attack must come into contact with flesh, not rock)

+ **Shrike/Skraev/Shrowd**: Aerial swoops

+ **Pangar**: Roll, only from the front

+ **Gnasher**: Belly slide, must hit the face

+  **Stormclaw**: Long charge and Electric charge

+ **Kharabak**: Charge


___


## **Cells and Skills:**

Skills are benefits gained from Armour, weapons, and cells equipped. They stack up to 6 times increasing in strength up to that point, any points beyond 6 are wasted. There are a great range of offensive and defensive skills in the game and you can mix and match them to your pleasure to get the desired level and potency for your playstyle. ***The sum total of your skills can be seen in the infuse menu.***


Cells are found in the cores you get from leveling up a rank in 1 of the Reputations (slayer, weaponsmith, and alchemist) or doing their respective weekly. They can be uncommon (+1), rare (+2) or epic (+3) and convey a skill benefit when placed into gear, increasing in potency with each rank. There are 3 types of cell being:

+ **Mobility** - Feather - Movement speed, invulnerability frames on dodging and stamina regen/max

+ **Defensive** - Shield - Healing, shielding and debuff resistance

+ **Utility** - Eldritch Pylon, thing? - Healing benefits, meter gain, lantern charge

+ **Power**  - Knuckleduster Fist - Convey flat benefits to damage under certain conditions

+ **Technique** - Glowing Blade - Attack modifiers adding wound, part or stagger to hits, can also affect attack speed

The slots these can be equipped to are denoted by their associated symbols on:

+ **Weapons** - 2 slots - Weapons will vary on what slots they have depending on what behemoth they are made from and the type of weapon. Often have a bias towards power and technique, although Chain blades frequently get a mobility slot.

+ **Armour** - 1 slot per piece - Armour varies from part to part and between sets. be sure to check that it has the slots you want to infuse before crafting if you need a specific skill.

+ **Lantern** - 1 slot - Primarily Utility slots only

Cells can be extracted from gear at a cost of notes depending on their rank, the cell is not lost when doing this and can be reused as often as you like. 

+ **Uncommon** +1 - Green - 50 notes

+ **Rare** +2 - Blue - 300 notes

+ **Epic** +3 - Purple  - 1000 notes

It is worth noting that Skills will cap at 6 points per skill. The current total skill levels and their associated benefits can be seen on the right-hand side of the infuse menu. This is made up of a combination of the skills provided by your infusions as well as the natural skills from the armour and weapons you are using.

Even throughout the content drought after CoO I stuck with the game and grinded tokens or helped people through raids. I love finding new weapons and gear and try them out, but honestly, all armor sets have issues, are lackluster, and most new ones are just blatant reskins. 

Shaders leave some colors untouched, capes and marks clip through certain pieces, new armor like the Iron Banner armor has a weird bottom layer that looks like a knights underpants and vanguard / crucible ornaments are just reskins, worse than Season 2.  


  
I have been wearing the same assortment of pieces since I got to 305 at launch, pieces that fit together, look rugged and I am happy with. I'm getting tired of not having new armor to experiment with, and everything just seems lackluster and not really futuristic and fitting into the universe. 

Not to mention the lack of perks or stats on gear, which makes farming for something other than fashion completely useless.  "

Taxes Got My Wife Out Of A MLM,14,575,False,False,False,antiMLM,1527483444.0,True,"First off, I wish I had known about this sub when this was all going on, but I appreciate that everyone here is able to see what's going on. Plus it's nice to have some place to rant about my experience a little.

My wife's aunt recruited her into selling for Posh, which does soaps and crap like that. Being the non-confrontational, supportive husband that I am, I let her go with it because I figured it wouldn't get bad. She wasn't working at the time, and I was doing retail, so we couldn't exactly throw money around, by she assured me she had a lot of friends who would buy it. 

I let it go on for a year or so. I took samples to work for people because happy wife, happy life. I tried dropping subtle hints that she wasn't going to be able to sell anything because she recruited everyone that had been buying from her to sell (including my sister). Nothing worked. We overdrafted a couple times because of orders she put in. I really, really hated Posh at that point. 

Then came tax season. I do our taxes because it's easy enough. So I asked her for all of her financial information from selling Posh. She kept pretty good records, but apparently never looked at them. I can't remember the exact total, but I believe she was down around $200 during her year ""selling"" Posh (I really expected it to be worse). When I laid everything out to her, and reiterated the fact that she didn't have anyone to sell to, she finally agreed to stop. 

A couple months later she really wanted to start selling Lularoe and Jamberry. Rather than being supportive, I just basically told her she'd make a terrible drug dealer because you can't keep all the supply for yourself and never sell any of it. Thankfully it sank in before she could get roped on again.

Since then, she furthered her education, has a gotten a job she loves, and she thankfully doesn't want to be a part of any MLMs anymore.

Sick Leave Certificate,32,360,False,False,False,MaliciousCompliance,1527489157.0,True,"I had a delightful power tripping, new promoted supervisor a few years ago. She had no idea of my department or how it worked but she still tried her hardest to micromanage me. I would just make up acronyms of things I had on and she would write down all my fake acronyms &amp; numbers I gave her then I'd carry on my merry little way &amp; delegate the actual work to my team for the day.

If I ever called in sick, she would demand a medicate certificate. Company rules were you needed to supply one on a Monday or Friday, following or preceding a public holiday or more than 1 day of consequentially. I would call in rarely, as in I had over 3 months of sick leave accrued. She would demand a certificate even if it was a single day on a Wednesday.

This pissed me off as I didn't want to go out in public &amp; daylight, spend $70 to see a GP to get a piece of paper to confirm I had a migraine. My GP was also pissed off at bosses wasting their time to confirm their adult staff were, in fact, not well enough for work.

I would walk in to my appointment, he would ask why I had seen him &amp; I would say to get an expensive piece of paper to verify my head hurt. He would then write me off for the rest of the week.

I would call the idiot back &amp; say I had said piece of paper, however if she was willing to back off &amp; not require it, it would be a single day. If she was insistent on the certificate it would be 3 days. She never backed down so if I ever had a migraine, it was always 2 or more days off. 

I still had over 3 months of sick leave accrued before I quit which sadly doesn't get paid out, but just proves I didn't abuse my sick leave. Worked there 8 years."

First Cardano smart contracts testnet launches,33,82,False,False,False,CryptoCurrency,1527517450.0,True,"Here is the official statement:

""The first Cardano smart contracts testnet [launches today](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/goguen/), the KEVM testnet, a correct by construction version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\) specified in the K framework. This technology, produced by Runtime Verification with the support of IOHK, is the first time that a complete formal semantics of the EVM have been produced. This is an important first in cryptocurrency that is a necessary step towards the promise of third\-generation blockchains.

A smart contract allows you to exchange something of value \- money, property, shares \- by means of a software protocol. The terms of exchange are agreed upon by the parties involved in the same way as a traditional contract, and the contract is executed automatically on the blockchain.

Developers will be able to take any application that runs on the EVM and execute it on the KEVM, which can also be used to rigorously prove that smart contracts work correctly. This is done by formally specifying a contract’s desired properties in K, combining the contract with the KEVM specification, and then using the K framework to verify those properties.

Our second Cardano testnet to launch will be IELE, which is a new virtual machine for Cardano. IELE will be launched in July and is a register\-based virtual machine similar to LLVM with an unbounded number of registers, that supports unbounded integers. With IELE, developers can write, compile and execute smart contracts [**in the language of their choosing**](https://github.com/kframework) \( C, Java, JavaScript, Python, Solidity, Plutus, Vyper and about 20 more...\), with improved security and performance compared to the KEVM testnet.

For now, we recommend that developers use the Solidity language on both testnets. However, the vision is that eventually smart contracts will be written in high\-level languages that translate to IELE, such as new languages like Plutus \([being developed by IOHK](https://youtu.be/YMkFBw9F4rI?t=34m17s)\), but also existing languages such as Java or Python, and then IELE\-to\-IELE translators ensure the resulting code is optimal.

K was developed by Runtime Verification in collaboration with Professor Grigore Rosu’s Formal Systems Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana\-Champaign during the past 15 years, and incorporates the state of the art in language design, semantics and formal methods. Read more about the K framework [in this blog](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/k-framework-an-overview/) from Prof Rosu, founder of Runtime Verification. A blog about formal verification and what this means for smart contracts will follow soon.

Smart contracts must be formally verified, so they run exactly as specified and are free from bugs or flaws. Only then can they be widely adopted as financial infrastructure that can be relied upon by billions of people.

We look forward to receiving your valuable feedback about using the testnets which will help us make Cardano best in class.""

I've been mining bitcoin for 30 months. Here are some VERY interesting facts:,32,53,False,False,False,Bitcoin,1527526137.0,True,"Tl; Dr --- Just skip to the last paragraph.

I have met with numerous large mining operations in the last two years (in the US, a few countries in Europe and China). I have seen a lot of different ways to set up mining centers.

The miners who pay the least in electricity pay about $0.03 per kwh. These are miners based in Washington State and some small operations in the European Alps. Both of these operations use hydro power.

Chinese miners pays about $0.04 per kwh. Some pay a little less and some pay a little more.

Some miners are inefficient at cooling and some are very efficient. Using HVAC is the most expensive. The small operations in the Alps are using the natural cool air to cool their miners. This seems to be the most cost-effective. The next most cost-effective is liquid submersion cooling.

Natural air-cooled mining centers are the cheapest to build. They basically just need fans to pull in the cool outside air and exhaust fans to exhaust it. These systems add about 5% in energy consumption for each miner.

HVAC is pretty costly to purchase and adds about 25% in energy consumption to each miner.

Liquid submersion cooling is very expensive to build but it is the most efficient. You can disconnect the cooling fans when the miner is submerged in liquid. This saves about 8% on energy usage per miner. So, liquid submersion cooling actually SAVES energy costs BUT it is crazy expensive to build.

S9 miner = 0.00082 btc per day = $6 per day
Cost of electricity for each S9 miner = $1.25 per day
Cost of electricity for each air cooling for each S9 = $0.07 per day
Cost of electricity for HVAC per S9 = $0.25 per day
Cost of electricity for liquid cooling per S9 = $0 per day

So, the miners who pay $0.03 - $0.04 per kwh AND spent the millions on liquid submersion cooling are the miners who can remain running the longest when the price drops substantially.

People feel that Bitmain has a distinct advantage in mining because they build the miners AND they run them as well. I have determined that this is NOT an issue at all for large miners who purchased their systems prior to February, 2018. If you purchased your miners before the recent drop really kicked in (around February) then you could have sold them after purchasing for a profit of $1,000 (then you would, obviously, immediately re-purchase). This will put your cost of each miner in line with Bitmain. Thus...you are on even ground with them as a competitor.

Most large miners bought their equipment and built their mining infrastructure when the price was rising. This means that most large miners are in VERY good positions because their infrastructure is likely paid off.

So, the best miners are currently making about $5 per day in profits for each miner. And the best of the best are making about $6 per day.

Bitmain has had the same miner for a long time. There has been no risk in owning this ""old tech"" for much longer than you'd own a server in a data center without any upgrades.

So, what does it all mean? Well, if the largest miners have already paid for their miners and infrastructure (which they have), then these largest miners can still be profitable at a bitcoin price of $2,000 now, which is their cost to mine 1 btc.

The price is pulling towards $7300 right now. Some mid-sized miners will start to shut down, temporarily, at about $7000 because they did not follow my plan of selling their miners after 3 months of use (then re-purchasing)....and they pay $0.11 per kwh for electricity. Oh...and they did not invest in the best infrastructure. So $7k-ish is their break-even.

I pay $0.00 per kwh for electricity because I built an off-grid, solar operation in the middle of the desert. And my exisiting miners have an average cost of $0 since I bought the miners over a year ago and I sold them after about 3 months of use (then I bought new ones from Bitmain). I'm NEVER gonna stop mining, regardless of price. But I only have about 1,000 miners. I think there are about 2 million miners currently working. I am not even noise on the network.

Bottom line: The majority of miners on the network are run by large miners. Mid-sized miners are going to start turning off around $6800-7000. I'm curious to see what happens if it drops to this level for a while. SUPER curious. I want to see what happens when it is JUST the few big guys.

**Edited to explain the difference between BIG guys and medium guys. $2k is the ACTUAL BREAK-EVEN price for the biggest players. A Bitcoin price of $0 is BREAK-EVEN for me but I don't move the needle....however I will keep mining til my equipment dies. For sure."

Pixel 3/XL Leaks Screen Comparison.,80,91,False,False,False,Android,1527514262.0,True,"This post is regarding this possible leak [here](https://twitter.com/Slashleaks/status/1001044050378706944?s=19). I want to make it abundantly clear that nothing is confirmed yet and this may just be smoke and mirrors. That being said, it looks believable to me. Still, take everything with a grain of salt. 

I decided to compare those screen protectors to the frame of the OnePlus 6 for a few reasons. It is the closest in build, with the top notch, bottom chin, and rounded corners. It is a phone that is being praised for their implementation of the notch (this is very subjective though. If you dont like the notch, you dont like the notch, theres no other way to cut it). And because I wanted to compare a phone which will be, probably, a similar build altogether. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/agF25HV.jpg) is the comparison. A few things to note are:

- We have no idea how large or small the two phones are. I made the XL the same size as the OP6, but it will probably be bigger than that. This would mean that the chin and notch are bigger vertically than they appear in the picture, but nothing is confirmed.
- I kept the Pixel 3 the same relative size to the Pixel 3 XL as per the leak, but cut it in half for better comparison. 
- The OP6 in the picture is a cutout of the frame of the phone, not just a screen protector. and thus side bezzles may not be comparable, but I think they probably will be. 

Personally I like the designs, for both of the phones. I've been desensitized to the notch, and with the option to hide it anyways, it doesn't impact me much. 

But I want to know what you people think.

I asked her how did she feel about that, and her reply was that she felt offended that an ugly guy has hit on her. I asked her why, and she responded that the fact that an ugly guy thinks he has a chance with her makes her feel ""less worthy"" than what she really is and the phrase that really shocked me was ""how dare he hit on me"".

I’m a 17 yr old closeted atheist that has been forced to go to church my whole life... Here’s my story.,79,228,False,False,False,atheism,1527495429.0,True,"It started when I was 6. I remember going down the road with my dad in our truck. Somehow we got on the topic of god, and I wasn’t quite sure what it was all about, even tho I had been around it since I was born.

So naturally as any kid would do, I asked my dad about it. He said something like, “He’s perfect and holy, and people who don’t believe in him will burn for eternity in a place called hell” 

Instantly, this stuck out to me. We got back to the house and I just stood in my room thinking about what he said. No kid wants to burn in hell. So what did I do? I walked out in the living room where my parents were and told them I wanted to be saved by jesus. We went in their room, got on our knees by the bed, and they said a prayer for me. 

Afterwards, I was back in my room just sitting there, having no idea what it all meant. I picked up a bible and began reading... this is where my story begins.

- 5 years later -

It’s the 6th grade now, and a lot has changed in my life since that day that I began to believe. I had studied a lot about the Bible, and could generally answer any question someone asked me about it.

There was the occasional “This doesn’t make any sense, so I’m not going to pay any attention to it.” Actually, that happened a lot.

I kept a journal of all the kids in my school I planned on targeting to share the gospel with. Every day I would talk to them at lunch about how they were going to hell if they didn’t change their ways. I even made a twitter account targeting atheists and I would try to debate them. (Needless to say, I ended up deleted twitter from the frustration.)

Also note that I didn’t just go to church every Sunday morning, but I went (and still go) every Sunday morning, Sunday evening, and Wednesday evening by the choice of my parents. So constantly having god placed back in my head kept me from thinking too much for myself.

- 2 years later (8th grade) -

Ah, who doesn’t love middle school? (Sarcasm) It’s a time of discovering new things, and you learn that the world isn’t as innocent as it once seemed. People started using all these cool new words like “fuck,” and I wasn’t having any part of that.

I knew that people in my church said that cussing was a huge sin, and that it would anger god. But, it didn’t take very long for me to start coming up with some loopholes. Instead of saying “What the fuck” like everyone else my age was saying, I’d say “dafuq.” To me, that was surely okay cause I wasn’t actually saying the cuss word in the form of F-U-C-K.

Since I was so heavily forced to be involved in religious activities with the church, I didn’t make making friends much of a priority. That is still a huge regret of mine today. (Remember, I was still a solid believer at the time.) I began to look at every person and my school and judge them based on how much they sinned. This kept me away from most people. Which kept me away from most social events.

I was taught that being with friends and having “worldly fun” would make me fall away from god and cause god to be mad at me. I didn’t want god to be mad at me cause I didn’t want to go to hell. This has affected me even to this day, because I simply have too much anxiety to go to a party or even enjoy myself at prom. I will forever hold a scar of feeling like I don’t belong.

Slowly, things were starting to make me more mad. I was losing friends and tried telling myself that the Bible was the solution. This dug me into a deeper hole and a closer bond with my belief.

- 1 year later (9th grade) -

High school... a completely new world for me. At this time, the world was still evil to me. It was something I couldn’t be a part of. But, nothing could keep the world from reaching out to me. 

Around this time, I started meeting more girls. I had never really made dating a priority, because I feared it would take the place of my love for god. But, I had feelings just like anyone else. I’ll never forget one of the first girls I ever really got close to. She wasn’t from the same school as me, so I didn’t know very much about her. 

One day, we were talking on the phone when out of nowhere she said, “... do you believe in god?” 

And I obviously I said, “uh, yea of course.” 

“Oh... that sucks, cause I don’t” she said.

At that moment my face went white. ‘How do I have feelings for someone that doesn’t believe in god’ I thought to myself. It was awful.

That was the moment the emotional roller coaster began. How could someone so nice and normal be an atheist?? I was told my whole life that atheists were evil people who were mean and nasty and just wanted to attack Christians.

I stopped talking to her after that conversation, but nothing would ever make me forget it and the effect it had on me.

—

It didn’t take long for me to start getting curious. I just couldn’t figure out how someone like her was an atheist. 

Scrolling through Instagram one day, I came across an account about atheism. I cringed and said, “let’s see what pathetic trash they have on here.”

I looked through every single post. Every picture. Every meme. Every scientific fact... Every comment on every post from every Christian that was debating the atheists. I simply closed the app. I didn’t know what to think. I didn’t want to think about it.

It all made sense. The actual facts I saw on that account were making me think. From every biblical conflict to every scientifically backed fact about the cosmos.

I began to cry, and soon forgot the things I learned after attending a couple of church services, where a motivational preacher would make me scared of hell yet again, and make me want to forget anything scientific.

—

Later in my freshman year, I met another girl. Instead of having feelings for her, I bonded with her as a friend.

It didn’t take long for me to discover that this friend was an atheist. But, instead of pushing her a way, I decided I would be friends with her and hope that I could convert her to Christianity. (Deep down I wanted to know what her life was like as an atheist.)

We took theatre class together, so we ended up spending a lot of time together. I actually never got around to telling her I was a hardcore Christian.

Eventually, I started hearing her talk to people about why she was so against religion and how harmful it was to society. (Of course I just rolled my eyes and tried to avoid listening.) But after a while, I wanted to hear what she was saying. 

Another day went by when I was scrolling through Instagram and came across yet another atheist account. This time, I started doing my own research about the posts I was seeing. It was at this moment, I started realizing that maybe, just maybe, I was wrong all along. 

** ( If you’ve never been a fully believing Christian in your life, you don’t understand the painful transition from believer to atheist/agnostic. For the first long while, half of you is trembling from the fear of hell, and the other half is embracing a new world of happiness and freedom. It has got to be one of the most mentally traumatizing transitions that a human can go through ) **

And as it turns out, I actually followed that account. A few hours later, I got a text from that friend saying, “hey, are you an atheist?” And when I opened it, I just sat there speechless...

It must’ve been 10 minutes that I just sat there.

“Yea...” I said. I could barely read my own text from how much I was shaking.

“Oh cool! I am too. I just saw your name on the following list of this one atheist account and thought ‘wow! I didn’t know Michael was an atheist’.”

I didn’t know what to think, and I didn’t know what to do. I felt different. I was scared, excited, happy, and sad all at once.

- 1 year later (10th grade) -

At this point, I was fully considering myself an atheist, but didn’t want anyone to know. The only person that knew was that friend from theatre. 

I later explained to her what happened, and told her that I didn’t want people to know, because my family would basically disowned me. (Just like they did with my brother who came out as gay... haven’t seen him in 8 years.)

She respected that and we kept it a secret.

Life was a lot different at this point. Church wasn’t the same now, it was now something to regret and get mad at because I was forced to go 3 days a week. Every time I went, I realized more and more how indoctrinated I had been my whole life. 

There was only one thing that kept (and is keeping) me sane in the midst of these constant fallacies that are shoved down my throat... computers.

Computers unlocked a whole new world for me. It was the one place I felt free and happy. At first, I was just always doing my own research on space and other sciences. My interest in physics and cosmology grew greatly. (The fact that it could take billions of years for light from another galaxy to reach earth just absolutely fascinated me, and reassured my decision to abandon my faith.)

My obsession for computers continued. I started learning how they worked and more importantly— how to code.

One day, I decided I was going to create an iPhone app and put it on the AppStore. This would be a cool side project that would fuel my love for computers and technology, while keeping my mind off of the fact that I had not many friends and people to hang out with.

The idea for my first app was simple. I wanted an app that would give users suggestions of movies to watch on Netflix. Sounds simple and innocent, right? Well apparently not. 

It took about 8 months, but with a ton of effort and learning, and a $100 Apple developer’s license, I finally released my beloved app on the AppStore for free. I even had ads on the app so I could make a little money on the side.

This all came crashing down one day, however. I remember coming home from church on a Wednesday afternoon. In the truck, my dad began yelling at me. He said that people in the church were concerned about me, so both my parents decided to have a closer look at my app. They discovered the genre of horror movie suggestions. In their church, they believe horror movies or anything involving witches or wizards are evil and sinful (even the Wizards of Waverly Place.) 

They both began screaming at me saying how much of a disappointment I am. I told my dad I would delete the app once we got home and he said, “GOOD. You think I care? I don’t feel bad for you at all.”  So that’s what I did. As soon as we got home, I ran inside, got on the Apple developed portal, and sent the signal for my app filled with months of sleepless nights and relentless work to be removed from the AppStore, along with all its data. And just like that, I got an email saying it was gone.

I could no longer feel. To care about a project so much then have your parents say they could care less about it and have you delete it, over some horror movies.

I got in my bed and all I could do was cry. I didn’t care anymore, I just wanted to cry. Deleting that app was like killing my own child. (It may seem extreme, but you should’ve seen how happy I was to actually create this app, and the work I put into it.) A little bit later, my parents come into my room and start reading me verses from the Bible about how what I did was wrong. I fell asleep screaming for them to leave me alone as they continued to read.

- 1 year later (present day) -

By now, I have been through a lot. The app situation was only a sliver of the struggles I’ve encountered. I’ve had many more situations worse than this.

Over these few years, I have learned so much about life. I’ve learned what it’s truly like to be free from religion, even if I still have to live with it. 

Here I am today, in church as I was just told “evolution can’t be real, because someone would’ve struck some slime with electricity and created a new creature” and thinking.... how much longer do I have to go through this.

—

So yea, that’s my story. Just know that if you ever feel alone, you’re not alone. I know how it feels to feel trapped in a world that you don’t belong in. 

Soon, I will graduate and be free. Until then, I’m only learning more and more about computers every day, the only thing that keeps me sane."

Another player who had a poor season before joining us? Mkhitaryan,63,104,False,False,False,Gunners,1527516603.0,True,"Playing under Mourinho, Mkhi struggled severely and seemed to lose confidence. Playing in quite a defensive team, his first game set the tone as he got subbed off at half time even though it was Joses fault who didn’t give him time or opportunity to get into rhythm. When United played more attacking footy at the start of the season he had five assists in three games. That’s good regardless of the language we are speaking. Mkhitaryan Has been a revelation since arriving in January.

Dortmund had the hot start under Bosz playing the suicidal high line which came back to bite them. Their defence was worse than ours for a good few months until they hired Stoger. Eventually the defence somewhat settled but it was a super underwhelming season for Sokratis and Dortmund as a whole.

I think we gotta trust Sven’s judgment. Not like we have much choice anyway. Under Emery and hopefully with some actual protection in front(Emery please just get NZonzi) times will be easier for Mustafi and Sokratis. Don’t forget before Pep came in Otamendi  looked like a headless chook and now he’s very solid. 

We still gotta get an established CB eventually but hopefully that will be after we reach the UCL again with one of Holding/Mavropanos/Chambers/Soyuncu(if we get him) usurping Sokratis. "

Look again.",168,2055,False,False,False,westworld,1527465110.0,True,"Edit: If you're looking for insight more relevant to the big reveal of this evening, [here's my post from two weeks ago detailing the big picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/8jvzif/andys_cake_day_mega_theory_part_2_ford_is_in/)

Edit 2: Okay fine, since so many of you want me to start a YouTube channel, I'll do it :\) Follow [https://www.youtube.com/user/ajniggles](https://www.youtube.com/user/ajniggles) and I'll have the first of many videos up in the next day or so. Lots of great theory to get out there before the season is done. And thank you for the Gold!!

Going along with the Aeneid themes popping up in various places \(ARG, background elements\), I’d like to put forth the theory that **Lee Sizemore is Westworld’s equivalent of Cassandra, the prophet who is always right but cursed with never being believed**.  He’s designed by the showrunners to be dismissed as comic relief and a poor foil of humanity for comparing with hosts, which is why we chuckle at his dialogue then move on to studying the “serious character’s” dialogue for plot clues and thematic significance. But if you take the time to examine Sizemore’s dialogue\* \-and his writi\*ng\- from an unwitting foreshadowing perspective, he is a treasure trove of clues. I mention his writing, because its been clearly established that he wrote Maeve and Hector's scripted dialogue, so anything formulaic that they say before being awakened was actually written by Sizemore, and thus carries the same prophetic weight.

Lets start by looking at the clearest examples of Sizemore dialogue foreshadowing events that we’ve seen \(selectively cutting other characters' sections of dialogue for brevity\):

S01e01

&gt;*There should never have been an update in the first place. Ford and Bernard keep making the things more lifelike. But does anyone truly want that? Do you want to think that your husband is really fucking that beautiful girl or that you really just shot someone? This place works because the guests know the hosts aren't real.Stop the updates altogether. Maybe even roll them back a bit. Make the hosts more manageable.Well, think of the benefits in terms of design time, maintenance, costs. Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor. The guy's gonna chase his demons right over the deep end.*

Sizemore was absolutely right, if the update had never happened and the hosts had been made more manageable, none of the conflict in the show would’ve taken place.  Ford and Bernard do keep making things more lifelike, to the point where the hosts can kill humans just like real life outside of the park. And Ford absolutely chased his demons over the deep end, taking dozens/hundreds of human lives with him!

&gt;*I just wanted you to know that you have my support and that I know that the corporation's real interest in this place goes way beyond gratifying some rich assholes who want to play cowboy.*

Here in the pilot Sizemore is perceptive enough to grant the audience a glimpse into Delos’ secret ulterior motive, which seems to be the foundational mystery of season 2.

&gt;*What the fuck is wrong with it? You updated the guy, and now he's a six\-foot gourd with epilepsy.So what the fuck happened?*

He’s not just commenting on the host in front of him, he’s foreshadowing his own work on Peter Abernathy.

&gt;*Are you fucking kidding me? That's 200 hosts spread across a dozen active storylines. We sell complete immersion in 100 interconnected narratives. A relentless fucking experience. Now, you pull one character, the overall story adjusts. You pull 200 at once, and it's a fucking disaster!*

If you believe the show is moving towards a Maeve vs. Dolores \(or Ford’s plan vs. Arnold’s plan\) overall story, Sizemore is telling you how it turns out. Maeve started with just herself, kept her posse small and is going to end up winning the long game. Dolores is leading a noisy revolution with her Wyatt troops and the exact 200 hosts Sizemore is describing, and it's not going to end well for them, in fact as we see in the S2 opener, it's going to be a “fucking disaster” \(though the sea\-of\-hosts is certainly not the end of the conflict, just one battle\).

&gt;*Listen, a changing of the guard is long overdue.*

More foreshadowing of Delos employees/board members being replaced by Ford\-controlled hosts.

&gt;*With considerable effort and lack of sleep, I've managed to massage events to inspire Hector to head to town a week early. Oh, and I've also punched up the speech he gives after robbing the saloon. It's chilling. You'll see.*

One day we’ll hear this speech and perhaps it’ll be great, but as we’ll learn by the end of this season, Ford did in fact steal/destroy Delos’ precious data shortly before starting his new narrative, effectively “robbing the saloon” then making his chilling final speech.

&gt;*You can hear it, can't you? That little voice. The one that's telling you ""don't. "" Don't stare too long.  Don't touch. Don't do anything you might regret.  I used to be the same. Whenever I wanted something, I could hear that voice telling me to stop, to be careful, to leave most of my life unlived. You know the only place that voice left me alone? In my dreams. I was free. I could be as good or as bad as I felt like being. And if I wanted something, I could just reach out and take it. But then I would wake up and the voice would start all over again. So I ran away. Crossed the shining sea. And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that goddamn voice. Do you know what it said? It said ""This is the new world. And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want.*

Yea, that super\-apropos\-for\-hosts\-awakening\-and\-escaping speech Maeve gave a thousand times? Sizemore's.

s01e02

&gt;*You find yourself in a bad dream, close your eyes, count backwards from three wake yourself right up.*

Maeve's wake\-yourself\-up technique? Sizemore. \(NOT positing that he had anything to do with her awakening, just pointing out that he probably wrote that\).

&gt;*Oh, he hasn't weighed in on a storyline in years. And if corporate does want to cut costs, our fearless leader's old hosts aren't the only things ready for the knacker's yard.*

This phrase is easy to dismiss as some quaint English expression, but a literal knacker’s yard is where old horses \(who are too sickly to be consumed\) are rendered into different materials which are repurposed into new products. Might this foreshadow Ford “becoming the music” \(according to Ford’s speech\) and being rendered/repurposed into a new form, either as a host or as code?

&gt;*You know the first voice I heard when I got off that boat? A nice young man from Baton Rouge said my pussy could earn him two whole dollars a day. And he'd be more than happy to let me have up to 30\%.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Well, then I guess you could add lying to your list of sins.The only thing wrong with the seven deadly sins is that there aren't more of them.And while we're on the subject, my transgressions wash off a little easier than yours. At least when my girls are done with a man, he's still left drawing breath.*

If Maeve ever makes it to the mainland, she should absolutely NOT trust the first person she talks to.

&gt;*This storyline will make Hieronymus Bosch look like he was doodling kittens. I have vivisection, self\-cannibalism, a special little something I call the ""whoroborus. "" Now, I don't want to appear immodest, but this is the apex of what the park could provide \- horror \- romance, titillation. Our most skilled guests will fight their ways to the outer limits of the park, besting fearsome braves, seducing nubile maidens, befriending tragically ill\-fated sidekicks, and, of course, like all our best narratives over the years, our guests will have the privilege of getting to know the character they're most interested in Themselves. I present our guests' next obsession: Odyssey on Red River.*

He’s describing William/MIB to a T. Most skilled guest, check. Edge of the park \(Logan’s sunset ride\), check. Seducing nubile maidens \(Dolores\) check. Befriending tragically ill\-fated sidekicks \(Lawrence/El Lazo\), check. Getting to know themselves \(the “Door” game Ford has given him\), check.  Only thing missing is besting fearsome braves, but in this same episode, MIB says to Lawrence:

&gt;*You know, you and I hunted down Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds.*

Check.  As a bonus, “Odyssey on Red River” is an anagram for DOOR NINE: VERY DRESSY, so William’s door will likely be pretty fancy and have a #9 on it. Alternatively. DOOR ENDS YR EVERY SIN...

S01e04

&gt;*You sound like a man who's grown tired of wearing his guts on the inside. It's simple. I believe that only the truly brave can look at the world and understand that all of it gods, men, everything else will end badly. No one will be saved.*

Bleak, but it is an HBO show.

&gt;*This is a shade. Sacred native lore. They make figures of them. You've seen this? The man who walks between worlds. They were sent from hell to oversee our world.*

Ostensibly it's about the Livestock Management folks in their suits, but if you read it again, it's a **perfect description of Bernard**. Walks between human and host, sent from Hell \(Ford is consistently portrayed thematically as the Devil as often as God\), oversees the world.

&gt;*Sweetheart, if I took that manner of interest in you, you'd have no say in how long we'd need whatsoever.*

In the moment it was simply sassy banter, but now with her control powers, Maeve could literally make Hector do whatever she wants with him having no say.

&gt;*I'm not in the habit of cutting into defenseless women.*

Funny that he says this about Maeve, and his doppelganger Musashi stops short of cutting into her as well, and not because of her voice command \(which didn’t work\).

&gt;*The Dreamwalker said there were some who could see them.  That it's a blessing from God.A blessing?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*To see the masters who pull your strings.They don't know what they're talking about.*

If you ascribe to the theory that Maeve is the agent of Arnold \(or simply the agent of good/light\), it would make sense that her awakening is a gift from god, as Arnold and Ford are consistently called the gods of the park.

S01e06

&gt;*Do you have any idea what went into those narratives that he just demolished overnight? Now, forget about the months I spent writing. I'm talking about the years of my life squeezed down to their essence, the raw pulp of truth. My truth in one transcendent narrative.*

This applies even more to Ford’s final narrative than it does Sizemore’s, and the choice of the word Transcendent is significant \(transcending your humanity?\), as well as the implications of “the years of my life squeezed down to their essence, the raw pulp of truth”. Sounds an awful lot like the red and white brain\-cupcakes we’ve been seeing.

&gt;*Your favorite narrative is… ""The Final Burial of Salvation.""How did you know?*

This could reference two things, both relevant to Charlotte. James Delos was revived/saved/granted salvation in the cave 149 times, but each time he was incinerated in the cave, essentially buried. 149 \(or perhaps some forthcoming 150th time\) would be the Final Burial.

If the theorists are correct and Glory/Valley Beyond is where everyone is heading and where the flood took place, then the flood essentially buries the weapon/place that was everyone’s hope or salvation. And it would be the final burial because we saw William’s terraformers digging up that area in the first place, so it's being reburied.

Either of these explanations make sense for Charlotte as she is one of the main agent’s of protecting Delos Board’s secret project, which clearly involved these secret labs.

&gt;*Looks like acid rain on Sweetwater! Fuck Ford and his new fucking narrative.Fuck this stupid fucking map. Fuck that teetotaling Danish bitch.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Are you filing a complaint, Mr. Sizemore?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I am declaring that this park is my stage and I shall do with it what I please.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Well, I suppose now is as good a time as any. Lee Sizemore, this is Charlotte Hale, executive director of our board. She's here on behalf of Delos to oversee certain transitions in our administration.*

Beside the obvious pee/flood metaphor, it's interesting to note that Sizemore is voicing the exact motivations of Ford: this park is my world and I’ll do whatever I want, and I’m willing to piss on all of your hard work because it's mine. Bonus: It's not Sizemore saying it, but Charlotte being there to “oversee certain transitions in our administration” is wonderful foreshadowing for the likely finale of S2.

s01e08

&gt;*The greatest shame in life is to perish without purpose, which is why I always consume my victims fresh.Lee: Moist. Try, ""Consume my victims moist."" Now, once more, with feeling. Almost sensual.*

Including fake\-Wyatt’s monologue in the S2 premiere was a neon billboard telling us “PAY ATTENTION TO SIZEMORE”, but for most of us it seemed like nothing more than a funny throwback. It signalled several important things:

1. This season will be all about the creations turning on their creators \(duh\)
2. Unwoke hosts often repeat the writers’ lines of dialogue verbatim, so characters who were written by Sizemore may also carry his prophetic significance for viewers \(Maeve and Hector in early S1 scenes\)
3. Wyatt’s speech itself gives big clues to the season endgame. The greatest shame is to perish without purpose, so there is a purpose to these humans’ deaths, ie: host replacement \(just my longstanding bet\). And “consume my victims”  doesn’t have to be literal eating, but assimilating/absorbing them into your species/army through clone\-host replacement.

S01e10

&gt;*Do you really think Ford is gonna roll over on this?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*As long as you get that information out of the park, he can throw as much of a tantrum as he likes. It's over. Everything is under control.*

Once again, no one listens to Sizemore. He knew Ford wouldn’t “roll over on this”.

S02e01

&gt;*It's like the inmates are running the asylum!*

This will make sense after the S2 finale. The inmates will be truly running the asylum.

&gt;*You You can't leave me here! The hosts! They've gone mad! No offense. Please! \- Help me! \-*

Funny that he says “they’ve gone mad, no offense”, because she is the only one truly awakened, the rest have essentially been driven mad by Ford’s manipulations.

&gt;*No one's in control.OVER P.A.:All systems reporting normal.*

More foreshadowing of the S2 finale, where the crisis suddenly appears neatly tied up in a bow, only for us to learn that the Delos board and many guests/employees have been replaced with clone hosts under Ford’s control. No one is in control, because Ford is “dead” \(aka no one\) and there are no people \(humans\) left in control.

&gt;*But But And I say this because you seem really distraught, and, well, awake, you your daughter, she's she's just a story. Something we programmed. She's not real.*

We’re going to see Maeve find her daughter living happily with her new host mother on the homestead, and Maeve will realize that she can’t take her “daughter” out of her world just to satisfy Maeve’s maternal feelings and nostalgia. Whats “real” for Maeve is what we saw last week with Sakura and Akane, AKA Clem and Maeve. Maeve will turn her sites on rescuing her “true daughter”, Clementine.

&gt;*Look, order is gonna be restored here. They're gonna purge the park of all the hosts that have been damaged, but the but the hosts, well, well, your minds \- Your minds are worth billions in I.P. They'll want to salvage what they can. And when that time comes, I can personally vouch for you. I\-I can save you. Just like you saved me.QA Guy: Emergency situation, ma'am. The hosts are malfunctioning. They're attacking guests.Might some of them even be dressed as if they're human?*

This is all a direct comment on the end of the season. We’ll find out that Stubbs, Charlotte, Strand and others have been replaced with clone\-hosts and are getting things back under control and sweeping everything under the rug. As we saw in ep5, the hosts can’t be replaced since the Cradle was destroyed, so they have no choice but to reprogram the existing hosts instead of destroy them, which is exactly what Arnold wanted \(so they could reawaken in S3 and truly free themselves\).

&gt;*If you try something like that again, I will relieve you of your most precious organ and feed it to you.Though it won't make much of a meal.I wrote that line for you.A bit broad, if you ask me.*

Reiterating \(twice in one episode\) that things some of the hosts say are directly from Sizemore’s brain, and thus also inadvertently prophetic. Also, that would be self\-cannibalism, one part of Odyssey on Red River.

&gt;*But you don't understand, I can't make a fire or Or hunt. Fuckin' hate the outdoors!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Give yourself some credit, darling.Who better to navigate the park than the man most intimately acquainted with the characters in it?*

Again, not talking about Sizemore as much as Bernard and Ford.

&gt;*I wasn't able to find everything, but most of it is in here.*

Yea, we can’t learn everything from Sizemore’s clues, but we can learn a LOT. Also refers more specifically to the season 2 premier, which laid out all of the big clues, parameters and chekhov’s guns for the season’s big mysteries, like every good season premiere should.

S02e03

&gt;*LEE: W\-We're out of our depths up here. We should go back.Now.MAEVE: And give up just like that? No. You said so yourself This way is quicker.Yes, but we should really go back underground. QA is coming. They'll be launching a coordinated park\-wide assault, rescuing guests and putting down hostile hosts. Read: you.*

When he says this we’re thinking “what a coward he is”, but not five minutes later they’re bolting for an elevator to go underground, because they absolutely were out of their depths. Why does no one listen to Sizemore?

&gt;*When I awoke in the place where you play God, I realized Isabella was a lie. Just words in my head.But this This is true. She is my light.HECTOR/LEE: She is all I ever dreamed life could be.And then there's this bit, really dampens the knickers ""And when she died, the dream died with her, and I dared dream no more."" So maybe I do know you, just a bit.It's very pretty. And a bit sad. Did you have an Isabella? Did she die?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*\(CLEARS THROAT\) Not exactly. She um she left me. Said that my lifestyle lacked stability.So you wrote her into a narrative. Killed her off. And then wrote yourself a version of the man you've always wanted to be. I was wrong. It's actually very sad. It's ridiculous.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Well, so is holding hands, come to think of it.*

Several important pieces to glean from this:

1. This is the second time in S2 that someone completes someone else’s line. This time it's a writer finishing one of his actor’s lines, and the other time it was… Bernard finishing Strand’s line in the premiere.  Perhaps that response about “circumstances are less than ideal” is a commonly used one in hosts, and Bernard finished it out of over familiarity with host expressions.
2. Hector gets to deliver most of a dramatic monologue that he believes is entirely his own, only to learn it was pre\-scripted.  This is foreshadowing of Dolores, who has spent all season giving dramatic monologues about her independence, until she finds out in the season 2 finale that she’s been a pawn of Ford the whole time.

S02e05

&gt;*LEE: Yes, fine, I may have cribbed a little bit from Westworld.Well, you trying writing 300 stories in three weeks.*

Keeping in theme with Greek epics, here we have an example of Ekphrasis, art commenting on other art, the original idea of “meta”.  Nolan and Joy are winking at us, because they knew that at this point in the season we’d be theorizing that they’re simply copying the plot of Futureworld \(replacing humans with hosts, secretly collecting data on guests\). This is them saying, “maybe we ARE just cribbing the plot from Futureworld \(Westworld II\).” Don’t worry, they’re going to subvert our expectations wonderfully, this is them having fun with us.

&gt;*He's not supposed to be here. Who knows how seeing your own doppel\-bot is gonna fuck with your cognition? Heightened aggression and suspicion. Feedback loops. That. Yet another reason to get out of here tout fuckin' suite*.

We’ve seen in trailer stills that there are a handful of Bernard bots in storage, so when he sees them, expect this passage to be applicable.

&gt;*Our quest, I presume?  I recognize this one. It's called ""Army of Blood"".*

Appropriately, this one is really on the nose \(because Sizemore wrote it\): at the end of this same episode the army is chopping itself to pieces, blood flying everywhere. You can’t even be subtle on a meta level, Lee.

&gt;*Ninjas never show up in this story.The Shogun's army never comes into town.*

Lets look at Westworld approximate equivalents for Ninjas and the Shogun’s army:

Ninjas: Masked killers in a totally different narrative? Sounds like Wyatt’s cult, which is currently in Sweetwater, the total opposite of where it has ever been before \(easy difficulty Sweetwater vs. hard difficulty edge\-of\-the\-park\).

Army: Confederados or Ghost Nation in a quiet town?  Dolores’ army in the Mesa?

&gt;*LEE: No fucking wonder the daimyos didn't hear you. We've gone completely off the rails here, and this loon is driving the fucking train.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Next scene: Angela: Train'll be ready by morning.*

Direct comparison of the Shogun to Dolores, implying that she is broken or crazy \(or manipulated\), but also foreshadowing her staging a big attack \(like the shogun planned\) and failing in the long run. In the most literal comparison, the Shogun’s fate is akin to Dolores killing Clementine and Maeve killing Dolores because of it. You heard it here first, folks."

"""Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin.""",17,332,False,False,False,Jokes,1527497188.0,True,"A lawyer married a woman who had previously divorced ten husbands.

On their wedding night, she told her new husband, ""Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin.""

""What?"" said the puzzled groom.

""How can that be if you've been married ten times?""

""Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative: he kept telling me how great it was going to be.

Husband #2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.

Husband #3 was from field services: he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.

Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.

Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.

Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.

Husband #7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.

Husband #8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it.

Husband #9 was a gynecologist: all he did was look at it.

Husband #10 was a stamp collector: all he ever did was...

God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!""

""Good,"" said the new husband, ""but, why?""

Do you enjoy Overwatch?,278,262,False,False,False,Competitiveoverwatch,1527499472.0,True,"Honest question (and sorry in advance for the wall of text). 
I’ve lurked on this sub since around the beginning of OWL and one thing has stood out to me: absolutely no seems to have anything good to say about this game. And not just in terms of the regular “so and so is unbalanced” or “matchmaking needs to be fixed.” That’s present in every community, and is necessary in order to communicate with devs. But what I’m seeing more and more of is people who just seem to strongly dislike overwatch overall and have fundamental problems with it. I’m mainly thinking about how people seem to think it isn’t “skill-based” enough. 
I was looking through the sub earlier and one of the top posts from today is a link to a video about the closing of the skill gap in street fighter 5 and how the poster thought that was happening in overwatch. Now, I don’t disagree that this is happening in overwatch to an extent. However, what caught my eye is the comments to the post. Most of these comments were along the lines of “there’s not enough skill in overwatch.” “There’s no reason to play a high skill hero.” “There’s not enough ‘carry potential.’” This got me thinking: If all you want is so-called “mechanical skill” (which for most people is just a code-name for aim), why play overwatch? I’m not trying to be a dick or say you’re wrong for feeling this way, but I just genuinely don’t understand. There are plenty of games that are much more competitively focused (shooter-wise, I’m thinking mainly CS:GO). The thing that’s unique to overwatch is that there’s much more to it than aim. You can be a traditional sniper or AR-wielding super-soldier, but you can also be a gorilla who jumps in with a no-aim-required lightning gun thing. Or just shoot grenades. Or be a melee support, or any number of other playstyles. So what’s the point of playing this game if you take issue with all of these other “low-skill” heroes which are what separates it from other games? Is it just a sunken cost? Do you just like to complain and you don’t really care that much? 
Also, just in case there’s someone I haven’t pissed off yet, do y’all really think that blizzard should focus solely on the competitive community? Cause that’s the vibe I get most of the time.
Anyway it’s 4:30 in the morning and I rambled on long enough. But if any of that made any sense I’d love to get a glimpse into how all of you see the game."

The problem with new Elemental Hit explained in a reasonable/non-dramatic way.,92,52,False,False,False,pathofexile,1527525873.0,True,"Credits still go to /u/Fastidieux [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8mi3cu/shower_thought_the_new_elemental_hit_will_have/dzp9sxt/)(and probably some other who posted it, but I got linked to his comment), but because of the way that post is written some people didn't seem to understand how the mechanic works.

Going by [Mark_GGG's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8mi3cu/shower_thought_the_new_elemental_hit_will_have/dzp1zxc/?context=3) new Elemental Hit works like this: first, all damage the skill does is calculated like any other skill, then at the end only the damage of the chosen type is dealt. Why is this a problem? Because this also applies to the damage from the gem itself. So if you have a lvl 20 Elemental Hit you deal(top-end for easier calcs):

- 779 fire damage
- 637 cold damage
- 1280 lightning damage

Now, when you actually attack only 1 element is chosen, so 779 fire damage for example, but cold and lightning are still calculated when it comes to conversion, so if you take Avatar of Fire(50% converted to fire damage), you deal:

- 779 fire damage (was: fire damage)
- 318 fire damage (was: cold damage)
- 640 fire damage (was: lightning damage)

from the gem itself, so if you hit a fire roll it will deal a whopping 1737 top-end damage. And because you can always force a fire roll with 2 jewels, it can be pretty broken."

"Instant kill feats are insanely un-fun, need to be tweaked or removed outright.",32,71,False,False,False,forhonor,1527517014.0,True,"It's insane how long these have stuck around. Nobody thinks it's fun to have a chance to win a game only to lose it because of a giant AOE that only assassins have the chance to roll out of if they aren't already running.

It's a core concept in video games that taking control away from players isn't fun, TF2 realized this when they removed the Scout's Sandman being able to outright stop people in their tracks (ala beartrap).

This game does not have the necessary counters to deal with such large AOE stuns from neutral. You will not get out of a catapult shot perfectly centered on you with a roll (Though Assassins may be able to.)

Nobody dislikes losing the ability to fight back. Stuff like Pugio, bear trap, are all very shitty but managable. Catapult, Fire Flask, Spear Storm, and Arrow Storm are just un-fun to deal with in every way. The passive last level perks like Phalanx (Mapwide shield) and Morale Boost (Mapwide damage boost) are actually pretty cool and give you some extra work to do rather than kill you in one hit.

Simply put, instant kill feats need to be looked at as soon as possible, for the good of game balance. "

"Me mudei pra cá de volta em 2015, primeira vez que me arrependo foi durante essa crise",183,164,False,False,False,brasil,1527507445.0,True,"Nunca morei direito no Brasil, mas sempre m senti brasileiro (pais brasileiros e tal). Decidi voltar terminando a faculdade, lá em 2015, até por que não queria fazer parte do brain drain- queria ser brasileiro, e até inclusive ajudar na minha pequena parte meu país. Durante a crise (recessão), nunca me arrependi- afinal, até quando tinha investigação de corrupção, eu sempre tive a sensação que o Brasil caminhava em um caminho bom. As pessoas eram contra corrupção. As pessoas rejeitavam o protecionismo bobo de privilegiar seletos grupos. As pessoas me acolhiam. 

Essa crise foi o que mais me assustou- não por que passei por mals bocados- afinal, moro ao lado do trabalho, e não sofri em nada com ela. Mas por que me assustou a mentalidade dos brasileiros- a inconsequência. Não dos caminhoneiros- mesmo se estou em total desacordo com eles. Mas como é que uma parcela significativa da população vai apoiar eles? Tipo, bloquear as ruas? Tipo, teve gente que morreu no hospital, teve 1bilhao de aves e suínos que morreram. Estragos bilionários em setores da economia que não vão bem. Gente que nem eles que talvez perca o emprego. Como é que vai apoiar uns, enquanto infligem danos em outros? Cadê os ambientalistas também? Que isso foi um desastre animal, econômico e até ambiental (acabar com impostos sobre gasolina e diesel e uma péssima ideia de um ponto de vista verde). Como é que as pessoas vão torcer para perder tanto? Não sabem que quem vai pagar são elas esse custo do petróleo? Essa retirada dos impostos? O frete mínimo, se for corrigido pela variação do preço do petróleo afinal já corrige todos esses problemas de descasamento de custo de petroleo e de frete. 

E agora os petroleiros querem fazer greve? E o kicker- uma das pautas deles e diminuir preço???? E ainda querem aumentar os custos (outros pleitos e que voltem a assumir outras atividades e não despidam outros funcionários).  E como o cara do supermercado fazer greve até o super diminuir os preços. Assim não dá. 

To começando a realmente achar que talvez meus valores são diferentes demais do povo brasileiro. Realmente, apesar de que meus amigos sempre me chamaram de gringo, e a primeira vez que realmente estou me sentindo como estranho no meu país. "

---

I'm thinking people need some closure as they see people they had previously fought alongside with in Legion be on the opposite side of the battle line in BfA.
Preferably added in the first or second patch.

Examples:

* Liadrin to Alliance Paladin Player: 

""It pains me that we have to meet under these circumstances Highlord. But you should know already that my loyalty to Quel'thalas supercedes everything else and I will strike you down if it means protecting my home.""

* Turalyon to Horde Player:

""Hold &lt;name&gt;, I wish to speak. I saw you fight valiantly on Argus. The Light shines brightly within you. If you renounce your loyalty to the Horde I will spare you.""

&lt;""For the Horde.""&gt;

""So be it, I will grant you a swift death.""

* Thalyssra to Alliance Player:

""&lt;name&gt; I will never forget how you helped me liberate my people and I am forever grateful. But my people needed allies who shared our values and convictions and we found that within the Horde. If you stand against the Horde you stand against me. I'm sorry.""

* Geya'rah to Alliance Player:

""Wait, I've heard of you. My father told me stories about you and how ferociously you fought to help liberate Draenor. It will be a great honor to face you on the field of battle!""

---

Just general stuff like that. I think it will spice up the story a little and shut up a few people who won't stop whining about how they've been ""stabbed in the back""."

5-question challenge for GenX or Millennial exmos to ask your parents who are harassing you for leaving the church:,21,127,False,False,False,exmormon,1527507713.0,True,"1. Did you act out, in the sacred and holy temple, your gruesome death, by throat slitting and gut slashing?

If the response to this is “no”, they are lying. If “yes”, how did it make you feel and why would you think it would be ok to raise me in this religion?

2. Did the prophet issue a letter in 1982 stating that oral sex was wrong? Was this letter ever retracted? Does the edict still stand? 

3. When did you find out that Joseph Smith had 30+ secret wives? Why didn’t you tell me?

4. When did you know Joseph used a rock in the hat to dictate the BoM? Why didn’t you tell me?

5. Were you ever taught the “curse of Cain” doctrine in church, in conversation with local leaders, or hear it from books written by general authorities?

Mom/Dad - can you understand why I might have reservations about this religion? Will you still love me and interact with me even though I have chosen to distance myself from the church?

Edit: it’s possible some parents of millennials (born 1980 - 1994) could have gone through temple after 1990, gotten married, and had a kid before 1994. Harder if the man was a missionary, as he would have had to gone through temple, gone on a mission (2 yrs), returned, married and impregnated his wife (9 mo)...  point being, if you’re a millennial and your parents were TBM when they married, they highly likely performed the throat slitting and gut slashing. But possible they may have just missed it."

I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt. He ran. Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog running. Until, at last, he finally caught it.

Why is most of each map unused?,49,338,False,False,False,DestinyTheGame,1527499693.0,True,"Everyone's talking about a content drought, but there's so much already created that's nearly entirely unused. It feels like nearly half of each map is technically explorable but contains absolutely zero content outside of a few random enemies and the collectibles. Why don't we have chests, random elite enemy spawns, or public events in these already existent but unused areas?

Though Titan is the worst offender for this by far with almost no content despite a map similar in size to all the other areas, it happens on every planet save for possibly Mercury (just because Mercury is tiny and bare to begin with) and *maybe* Mars (due to the collectibles, though this still leaves no reason to revisit these areas outside of random collection). These areas are usually indoors and some have one or two scannables (mostly parts of Io) though most do not. They're generally used to walk through on your way to the end of a single adventure and then left barren.

99% of these rooms seem to tell really interesting stories and are really well crafted. This *feels* like the kind of stuff I'd see in a Metroid Prime game (interesting and memorable areas with plenty of reasons to backtrack). Between the lack of scannables/lore info, lack of gameplay, and lack of player population, we're left with an amazing world to explore but no reason to explore it. I want to have a reason to scour every inch of these areas and to keep coming back to the most unique and interesting of areas, but at the moment, it's pretty much just a way to kill time and receive no reward at any point in progression for doing so. I love Destiny, but D2 is really breaking my heart with how much it squanders every single interesting thing it creates.

Can we please get any sort of reason of any variety to revisit the unused halves of the maps? Literally anything; I don't care if it's just weekly region chests, random elite mobs that spawn, or even just a couple throwaway scannables. We have a content drought at the same time we have a ton of already created content that's just sitting there unused; I see no reason that this should continue. I'm not asking for anything to be created from scratch, just a bit of copy paste to encourage players to explore a bit more."

These bug finders are able to find any device using Bluetooth, wifi, gps, or a radio frequency, and on top of that they can find hidden cameras. Most of these devices have a limited display, but recently, thieves have been using modified devices to pinpoint electronics in vehicles to within 2 meters. 

This means, using a high tech version of a bug finder with an arm mounted hud, IQ can find any device controlled by a phone, any camera, any device emitting a radio frequency, and anything linked by bluetooth or wifi. Note that even lesion's mines transmit real time location and status so he knows which ones are where, as well as if they went off, so they are detectable.

TL;DR 

IQ has a spy kids bug finder that lets her track any device that does RF, wifi, Bluetooth, or is a camera. It also functions as a tape player."

At 2:25 into the game we had a level 3 mid laner with double buffs. He completely took over the game and no one could do anything about it.

At 18 minutes I was level 10 (Soraka support) and he was level 17 and we just ran down mid and won.

It's sort of a reverse of the Taric-Yi cheese.

&gt;Edit: Also this is in Plat Elo, and here's a screenshot of that Karthus's last 5 games where he got Karthus http://prntscr.com/jnkgtw also he went predator for some reason."

"This sub is an echo chamber, not representative of the incredibly large fanbase of Star Wars",77,58,False,False,False,StarWars,1527529559.0,True,"There's a really strong echo-chamber effect that I see happening here. I used to be able to come here to have fun discussions about Star Wars but the whole place has become a dumpster fire of battle-lines being drawn and insults being thrown. More worryingly, I see a lot of tilted view points being spouted like they're the official stance of all Star Wars fans. I very frequently see the comment ""But it's impossible to criticize TLJ here without fanboys down voting you to oblivion"", with 100 upvotes. But what I've actually seen is that every mention of TLJ (or like, anything for that matter at this point) is met with ""TLJ is trash and it ruined my love of the franchise"" ""Most fans hated TLJ, it's obvious"" with, again, like 80 up votes. The supposedly-oppressed TLJ-critics seem to rule the subreddit. 


But Star Wars fans are a lot of people, one of the largest groups of people in the world. Just keep in mind that this board is an internet message board for people to make jokes and post pictures of Darth Revan and discuss Star Wars. This is a very very small, niche view of Star Wars fans. 

So when The Last Jedi gets very positive reviews from critics, and is one of the highest grossing films of all time, maybe it's because it's a good film that a lot of people enjoyed. I get that a lot of people here very much didn't enjoy it, but again, this subreddit is not representative of the incredible amount of people that are Star Wars fans. If Solo isn't making as much money, maybe it's because it wasn't marketed well, is a film about a character a lot of people didn't want a backstory on, and just isn't necessarily a home-run of a  movie. The Last Jedi being disliked by some people does not alter the quality of Solo, Solo can and will speak for itself. 

Being divisive also isn't a death-knell for Star Wars, The Empire Strikes back was a very divisive movie when it came out. It was slow-paced, talkative, and then the heroes lose. That wasn't Star Wars! And I don't even want to imagine what this sub in it's current state would have been like when Return of the Jedi released. 

I dunno, I'm rambling but I just wanted to shout into the void I guess. I really like Star Wars. "

TL;DR at bottom

Pulse; Uses NASA tech so stop resisting

Pulse's sensor is actually probably a direct ripoff of the NASA jet propulsion lab's FINDER rescue technology. In 2013 NASA published an article on it's new toy, named Finding Individuals for Disaster and Emergency Response, and it is literally a [heartbeat sensor](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-281)

The specs for NASA's toy is 9 meters through rubble, 6 meters through solid concrete, and 30 meters in the open to detect a human heartbeat. 

In 2015, NASA used it to find Nepal survivors, and in 2017 they used it to help find Mexico quake survivors, so it is proven technology.

They are obviously mum on exactly how it works, but it's not even a jump to say rainbow cerakoted a FINDER unit and gave it to pulse. What's crazy is that house walls are pretty thin so pulse's original detection range was probably more realistic!

TL;DR

Pulse has a NASA FINDER unit painted black. Unless NASA somehow resisted selling their device to the government there are probably heartbeat sensors in use by police and military today."

PSA: First of all, thank you guys for the support all season long. I didn't expect I'll be doing highlights this late in the season so hats off for the Celtics. Amazing year, incredible run considering all circumstances. Being just one win away from the Finals... I do think this will make our players better.

As for me, it's not the end of the season! I'll be doing series highlights, full playoffs highlights and of course full regular season highlights. All of this in the coming weeks so we can re-live this year in anticipating Celtics ""signing"" Kyrie and Gordo over the summer. This team is really going to add two all-star caliber players next year!

Thank you, once again, for making this season such enjoyable experience. This team was the most fun to cheer for and you guys were a big part of why I'll remember this year as the most fun I've ever had with the Celtics. But the best thing is: even more bigger things are coming. Training camp can't come soon enough! #CUsRise

The soldier had been granted rest and relaxation and was on a train that was bound for London.

The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat.

The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog.

The weary soldier asked, ""Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?""

The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?""

The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again.

Again, the soldier asked, ""Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.""

The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!""

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.

The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand, you drive your autos on the wrong side of the road and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window!."""

Just about when BOS started to fall apart and decide they didn't want to go to the finals I said F*** it and ordered a long island. All 3 of those guys asked if I could still drive after ONE long island iced tea lol (I'm nearly 300 lbs, 6 ft). I just had to chuckle at their ignorance.

The spinoffs do a much better job building the Star Wars universe than the Sequel Trilogy,367,1893,False,False,False,StarWars,1527462189.0,True,"To start off, I love everything Star Wars, prequel and sequel trilogy included. I didn’t think TLJ was some Star Wars abomination - I actually really liked it. Was it flawed? Yes. Still a good movie? Also yes.

But the thing I have noticed (at least just myself) is that the spinoff films are the only films of the new Star Wars era which seem to actually add to the Star Wars universe.

TFA and TLJ honestly to me seem extremely superfluous. Nothing of real note happens, and the world is in some ambiguous state which nobody really knows. Hopefully the new  Resistance show rectifies that. But over the course of two movies, it feels not much has really been added to the Star Wars universe, despite new aliens and planets. It seems so disjointed. We don’t see familiar aliens, and a lot of planets don’t have that Star Wars feel to them. Maybe I’m just going on a limb here but it feels the ST exists in some separate universe that somehow includes old characters rather than and expansion of the current one. Again this is just personal opinion.

Contrast to RO and Solo. Both of these feel like Star Wars, like they add to the universe. Maybe it’s because I’m an old EU fanboy, but the way those movies add planets and aliens seems like it expands the Star Wars universe and has a true Star Wars feel to it. And that contributes to why I like the spinoffs better. 

Not sure if anyone shares my sentiments but I think this is where a lot of the dissatisfaction with the ST comes from. The prequels did a fantastic job building the Star Wars universe with planets, species and technology and the ST really doesn’t have that.

Sorry for the rant I just want to share my Star Wars thoughts.

TL;DR - Sequels seem like they exist in some separate Star Wars universe while spinoffs feel they really add to the universe.

EDIT: This may seem like a bash on the ST. I love the ST, heck, Kylo Ren is my favorite Star Wars character. The ST has the best character development and themes out of all the Star Wars movies IMO."

Too bad for LeBron and the city of Cleveland, however, there was a defensive juggernaut waiting for them in Boston by the name of Marcus Morris. After 7 brutal games, LeBron would go on to average a mere **33.6 ppg** with Marcus completely clamping him down. Hats off to you, Marcus.

What hurts me the most about Ameer,5,152,False,False,False,brockhampton,1527513186.0,True,"I’ve always had a connection with Ameer’s lyrics, being in a bad place. Being on both ends of an abusive relationship before, going through substance abuse, it all made sense, and when I saw him smile with the boys and being successful it makes me a firmer believer in that things get better and people can change.

The people who have hurt me in the past don’t deserve to be ripped away from their families and persecuted, and I don’t believe I should be persecuted for the people I have hurt. I’ve hurt them and I have to make peace with that, and I’m proud of my progress as a person.

I don’t believe people are selective with who they try to reprimand for their abusive actions, however I think whoever receives a punishment is determined with how much power they have. I think Vince Staples does an excellent job explaining that in his [Coachella Interview ](https://youtu.be/P0zeb2zIJRw) about R. Kelly 

but then I remember I don’t know any of the people personally and these are just my emotional opinions lol

EDIT: What I love a lot about the group is that I don’t see any of them as perfect, because no one is. They’re able to use their vulnerabilities to create poetry in motion. I think Ameer’s verses and stories are just as important as Ian’s and I am sad/worried over his departure "

When does a bird sing? AFTER THE STORM,3,68,False,False,False,greatawakening,1527528571.0,True,"I made a comment about this recently and it got a better response than I’d anticipated. 

Now we all know that much of what Q says has double, sometimes triple or more meanings. Q has pointed out that birds sing at 4 AM, both literally, and shedding light on Operation Mockingbird sending out news talking points at that hour. 

But recently, given the coming of spring, bringing with it thunderstorms, I realized something. Birds sing after the storm. I’d be sitting there, windows open, and the storm would come, thunder, lighting, rainfall... and then it would pass. And then, all of a sudden, one bird would pipe up, catching my attention through the silence. Then more would chime in and before you know it, they’d all be singing along. 

When you think about it, people like Weinstein, Weiner, etc, their storm has already passed. The storm is when they are being investigated, a case is being built against them. When they’re eventually arrested and brought in, that’s it for them. The handwriting is on the wall and they’re gonna sing, giving up anything and anyone they can to lessen their sentence.

With Exotic Armor on the chopping block next I thought of a concept to make Celestial Nighthawk more versatile in PVE and greatly increase its Power Fantasy.,41,50,False,False,False,DestinyTheGame,1527530723.0,True,"So we all know Nighthawk is fantastic at boss DPS, but that's all its really useful for. This is the reason why I normally just go Orpheus Rigs Nightstalker because I can use my super on trash mobs and never feel like I am wasting my super and I can still use it on a boss for good DPS. Using your super is **fun!** and I feel bad using my Nighthawk super on anything less than a mini-boss. 

So how to fix it? I think its pretty simple if you have Nighthawk equipped and you pop your super you will use your golden gun as normal (3 shot or 6 shot) however if you want to use the single super strong shot you would have to hold the trigger to charge up the golden gun. Functionally this charge would work a lot like fallen cannons from HoW or the Wrath of the machine Raid, but the charge time would be **much faster** (maybe like 1 or 1/2 a sec). I think this will also make that single shot *feel* more powerful and make Nighthawk *feel* more exotic. Right now a Nighthawk shot feels exactly like any normal Golden Gun shot. I don't *feel* powerful using it even if I'm doing insane damage, because that power shot functions exactly like a normal shot. Having to charge it will make it feel powerful, unique, and most importantly EXOTIC. Just image charging up your shot and your flames on your Golden Gun change from burning gold to start to burn **white hot** (or maybe turn into blue flames)! That sounds like a super sexy power fantasy for me!

Now yes technically this change would *slightly* decrease your DPS when damaging a boss because of the charge up time, but I think you could add other things to the exotic to make up for that. Some ideas I had were...

* When you are charging your Golden Gun for that single shot maybe you zoom in a little or your aim slows down a little bit to help with aiming (just a thought). 

* Another idea was what if you could fire off a single normal shot and then charge up the Golden Gun for a less powerful but still strong shot using your other 2 remaining shots? Just to add some versatility. 

* Last idea, if you have forgotten Nighthawk has a second effect outside of the single power shot. Nighthawk also causes enemies to explode when killed by Golden Gun. You probably forgot about this because you only use NightHawk on bosses so it never activates. So the change would be that this perk could also activate if you decide to use the normal 3/6 shot Golden Gun making the super actually somewhat viable at killing trash mobs!

* If you have other ideas then share them below! 

I think these changes also might make Nighthawk **somewhat** viable in PvP (shocking I know). In 6v6 explosive Golden Gun shots might be worth running with people clumped up more, and if Bungie is not going to make it so Golden Gun can one-shot people in their supers then with Nighthawk you have the versatility to charge your shot to kill that Fist of Havoc Titan in one go or use the super normally to clean up his team behind him. I don't think it will ever be a meta PvP exotic but I do think it could be somewhat useful and that's more then we can say about it now in PvP.

Let me know your thoughts on this and if you have other exotic armor rework ideas leave them below i would love to read them!     "

Have you experienced insecurity as a result of stanning BTS?,49,85,False,False,False,bangtan,1527515892.0,True,"I feel a bit shy coming forward and saying this, but: I feel as though through stanning BTS, I've begun to question the value of my own accomplishments and goals, and I want to know if anyone else feels the same.

Here's come (personal) context (*feel free to skip*): I should be proud of myself. I just graduated from one of the top schools in the world yesterday; I'm going to go work for one of the most prestigious companies in my field. It's not nothing, and I should be proud, but I'm not. Like of course when I write out what I've done, or when my therapist has me say these things out loud, I realize they sound impressive, but when I compare my own accomplishments to what BTS has accomplished, I feel like I'm just some plain person who will accomplish nothing of note in her life. I might get stuff done, and I might have some kind of impact, but it's not going to be as interesting of a story as what's happened with them. And sure, I might make lots of money someday, but it's unlikely I will ever have a fraction of the impact on the world that they've had (especially given my field).

I think seeing the tweet from the President especially sparked these feelings--I thought, ""Ah, well, I'm never going to do anything worthy of that kind of recognition.""

What's weird is that I used to be excited about what I was doing, and excited to make the impact I saw myself capable of having. I studied computer science and wanted to start my own company someday--but now that seems pointless. For some reason, ever since I've gotten really into BTS, I feel a pressure to not consider the value of what I'm doing, and instead I see a much greater value on what they're doing and how they're doing it.

What's weirder is my full awareness that this feeling is the exact opposite of everything the Love Yourself message is about. As much as I can intellectually understand that, the feelings of inadequacy are still there. How to not compare one's self to Bangtan?

Since I know people will bring it up: I've been talking to a therapist about this. But I feel very much alone in this struggle, and I wonder if anyone else feels the same way, and if you've overcome it, or just in general what you're thinking about it.

I'm having trouble articulating the core of the issue (pulled an all-nighter to pack, so I'm a littleeeee incoherent rn), so I might edit in an executive summary later. But I would love to hear from others who might have gone through this as well, or even something tangentially related."

This is the reason why I normally just go Orpheus Rigs Nightstalker because I can use my super on trash mobs and never feel like I am wasting my super and I can still use it on a boss for good DPS. Using your super is **fun!** and I feel bad using my Nighthawk super on anything less than a mini-boss. 

So how to fix it? I think its pretty simple if you have Nighthawk equipped and you pop your super you will use your golden gun as normal (3 shot or 6 shot) however if you want to use the single super strong shot you would have to hold the trigger to charge up the golden gun. Functionally this charge would work a lot like fallen cannons from HoW or the Wrath of the machine Raid, but the charge time would be **much faster** (maybe like 1 or 1/2 a sec). I think this will also make that single shot *feel* more powerful and make Nighthawk *feel* more exotic. Right now a Nighthawk shot feels exactly like any normal Golden Gun shot. I don't *feel* powerful using it even if I'm doing insane damage, because that power shot functions exactly like a normal shot. Having to charge it will make it feel powerful, unique, and most importantly EXOTIC. Just image charging up your shot and your flames on your Golden Gun change from burning gold to start to burn **white hot** (or maybe turn into blue flames)! That sounds like a super sexy power fantasy for me!

Now yes technically this change would *slightly* decrease your DPS when damaging a boss because of the charge up time, but I think you could add other things to the exotic to make up for that. Some ideas I had were...

* When you are charging your Golden Gun for that single shot maybe you zoom in a little or your aim slows down a little bit to help with aiming (just a thought). 

* Another idea was what if you could fire off a single normal shot and then charge up the Golden Gun for a less powerful but still strong shot using your other 2 remaining shots? Just to add some versatility. 

* Last idea, if you have forgotten Nighthawk has a second effect outside of the single power shot. Nighthawk also causes enemies to explode when killed by Golden Gun. You probably forgot about this because you only use NightHawk on bosses so it never activates. So the change would be that this perk could also activate if you decide to use the normal 3/6 shot Golden Gun making the super actually somewhat viable at killing trash mobs!

* If you have other ideas then share them below! 

I think these changes also might make Nighthawk **somewhat** viable in PvP (shocking I know). In 6v6 explosive Golden Gun shots might be worth running with people clumped up more, and if Bungie is not going to make it so Golden Gun can one-shot people in their supers then with Nighthawk you have the versatility to charge your shot to kill that Fist of Havoc Titan in one go or use the super normally to clean up his team behind him. I don't think it will ever be a meta PvP exotic but I do think it could be somewhat useful and that's more then we can say about it now in PvP.

Let me know your thoughts on this and if you have other exotic armor rework ideas leave them below i would love to read them!     "

Current issues that should be addressed in Witchwood Arena since the last Arena update 3 weeks ago.,4,38,False,False,False,hearthstone,1527530008.0,True,"TL;DR: Update cards to put them in the right buckets, remove or lower the existing class/weapon card bonus, and have consistent updates in Arena. The changes so far have been good, but you can make Arena even better, Blizzard. TL;DR

Brief introduction: I'm a guy who have been playing Arena for years and made the leaderboard several times including last month. I made [this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8cz87w/current_problems_with_witchwood_arena_that_needs/) and within the same week an Arena hotfix happened. Currently I’ve been enjoying the meta with a very good average but some issues had come to the community’s attention.

To start with, the Arena community really appreciate changes made in Witchwood to ""fix"" issues that arose, but the system definitely has areas to improve. Two updates have happened to Arena since Witchwood about 2 weeks apart from each other, but now it's been 3 weeks. I only ask for consistency (consistency in updating regularly, as well as consistency in your update philosophy.) These past changes have been good, don’t get us wrong, but we like to see more. The bucket system basically requires up to date changes, and by not doing so, you start to see problems.

The most obvious issue is the **misbucketing of cards**. I understand Blizzard's model relies on stats. Well, any user can check HSreplay stats and notice huge disparities. For those who question where cards are in each buckets, u/Tarrot469 has a [spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArenaHS/comments/8lvzo7/arena_bucket_spreadsheet_updated_to_before/) that's a community effort in tracking what cards are in what buckets. It isn't perfect but it sure helps. Some examples of misbucketing:

* The most blatant misbucketed class cards belong to Shaman. Earthen Might, Rockbiter Weapon, Stormforged Axe are among the top 10 best Shaman non-legendary cards on HSreplay stats that belong currently in terrible buckets. Meanwhile Witch's Apprentice and Zap are in a good bucket when Earthen/Rockbiter/Axe have better deck *and* played winrate than these 2 cards. Both on paper and statistically, there is no reason to have these cards in their respective buckets.

* Worgen Abomination. Seriously, this card does not belong in the top bucket in any class and the fact it's been there for over a month since Witchwood is a weird conception. No stats or theoretical analysis support this card in the top bucket yet Blizzard still has it among the likes of Ultimate Infestation, Spikeridged Steed, Vilespine Slayer, and Meteor. Other cards that has no business in the top bucket based on stats and theoretical power level: Jeweled Macaw, Call to Arms (now that it’s 5 mana), and Bane of Doom.

* Silver Sword. If you ever played Arena in Witchwood, you’d recognize Silver Sword. It’s a card that has a better win rate than Consecration (which is in the top bucket) on HSreplay yet Sword is *only in the 3rd bucket*. This card is absolutely oppressive in the late game and belongs in the top bucket (hell just switch Worgen Abom with this card). In a similar vein, Ghostly Charger belong in the same bucket as Silver Sword currently and boasts *the 3rd highest deck win rate card* on HSreplay next to Vinecleaver and Truesilver. Um, why are these cards in the 3rd bucket and NOT in the top bucket? At least move them to the 2nd bucket. Is there some complicated algorithm Blizzard is putting these cards in their buckets other than deck win rate and/or played win rate?

*  Mind Control Tech. This card has universally been controversial in Arena and the issues have escalated in Witchwood for two reasons: Hundreds of cards have left Standard which means there are just more MCTs now in Arena, nearly 15% of all decks have at least one. The other reason is it belongs in a bucket right now where it simply is the best card to pick. That’s not to say MCT is the best pick all the time, but the average player will pick MCT more often than not. This can easily be solved by moving MCT a bucket higher, and has been recommended by many players as the most elegant solution to the MCT outcries. This example is a bit more controversial, so I understand if nothing changes for MCT. It just gets an honorable mention because you see MCT complaints nearly everywhere on Arena forums.

That’s all the examples I’m going to name, there are for sure other issues with misbucketing, but these examples shows that updates need to happen regularly since there are holes to the bucketing system that can’t be explained by stats. If updates are *not* consistently happening, card win rates will spike or decline because they’re in the wrong bucket. 

What I mean by this is that cards like Rockbiter Weapon have such a high deck win rate is because they’re in the wrong bucket. Rockbiter Weapon isn’t a better card than Crushing Hand, but since Crushing hand competes with Hex, and Rockbiter Weapon competes with shit like Wicked Skeleton and Leper Gnome, no wonder the card is doing better statistically. Another example I didn’t mention is Arcane Intellect, it has virtually the same win rate as Primordial Glyph yet Glyph is in the top 2 bucket, while Arcane is in the bottom 2 bucket. When cards are blatantly in the wrong bucket, it defeats choice-making which is the hallmark of the bucket system. Arcane Intellect is basically an autopick right now since it’s the top dog in the bucket and unless you’re swimming in card draws, you take it.

The other issue is **having the same trio of cards appear repetitively during drafting**. If you played enough Arena, you’ll see some repetitive options: Flamestrike vs. Poly. Vs. Fireball.  Kidnapper vs. Stonehill vs. Envenom Weapon. Mind control vs. Shadow Word Death vs. Free From Amber. Backstab vs. Eviscerate vs. Sap.  Despicable Dreadlord vs. Siphon Soul vs. Bane of Doom. Hex vs. Lightning storm vs. Crushing hand. The list goes on and on.

* Now we, the community, do not really know why this is happening exactly. We know a few things that might explain this: There’s a weapon/spell bonus that exists, making sure you’re more likely to get these cards than others. Since the cards are now in a bucket system, you simply get these identical picks over and over because of this bonus. An added problem to this is how cards like hex and crushing hand are always in the same trio. Hex is mostly better than Hand in more situations so you'll almost always pick Hex over Hand. If the bonus wasn't there, you will actually have to decide between a hard removal and a premium curve minion over 2 premium hard removal spells.

* We also know there are potential microadjustments with individual cards, but at this point we’re not really sure which cards are adjusted individually. Psychic Scream was microadjusted all the way back in December and you can see it’s still appearing less than other epic spell cards in the top buckets such as Meteor or Ultimate Infestation.

The point is, some of these older adjustments need to be entirely removed because the bucket system in addition to these small changes forces the player to pick the from the same 3 cards over and over again. There is no reason anymore to have such a high weapon/spell class bonus when there are only a few cards in the top buckets. This just forces every Druid to have an UI, a Paladin to have Steed/Vinecleaver, a Rogue to have Sap/Evis, a Mage to have flamestrike, and so on and so forth. 



Arena’s main selling point is that you get to see cards that normally don’t see play in constructed. If we’re drafting the same choices every time, we’re just playing a poor man’s Ranked deck, AKA, constructed-lite, and that is why so many people have been ... vocal on the changes. I don’t agree with many of the vocals that wants to give up on the bucket system. I feel the system can work, but you, the game developers, need to make updates regularly. I know it’s been mentioned only one stats guy does the changes on a part-time basis, but surely s/he can squeeze in a few hours every 2-3 weeks to update Arena.

These 2 issues are the more obvious ones that I come across. Please throw an upvote if you want to see more changes in Arena, thanks for reading!"

Newfound Appreciation for Global Server,85,262,False,False,False,FireEmblemHeroes,1527504152.0,True,"Recently I started to really appreciate how Fire Emblem Heroes runs on a global server.  Thanks to the global server, NA players are able to receive rewards they otherwise may not have gotten, such as the orbs from the Golden Week quiz.  Also, NA players are able to experience the games' highs and lows with international players, which has led to some nice interactions, such as the birth of ""The Reinhardt Meme.""  Ultimately, a main reason I think this sub is as vibrant as it is is because ultimately everyone is enjoying the same game, so nobody is ever left out.

I was also thinking, if FEH ran on separate servers, like one for Japan and one internationally, the results could be deadly.  Rewards could be distributed unevenly, which could lead to resentment between the two player bases and anger towards IS.  Also, summon banners could be on one server and absent from another, which could also lead to jealously and end any hope of any interaction between player bases.  

So yeah, its awesome that FEH run on a global server, and for that I am thankful.  I recently found out that this isn't the case for all gachas.  "

Change the Transversive Steps back to how they were in Destiny 1,38,140,False,False,False,DestinyTheGame,1527507334.0,True,"Transversive Steps are (currently) just not good, lets be honest. 

The perk for the original Transversive Steps was ""Gain faster movement speed while crouching. Picking up ammo automatically reloads the weapon matching that ammo's type"". The Transversive Steps were a quality of life exotic; always working in the background to the point that you forgot Destiny didn't auto reload weapons (until you took them off or played another class). It was a nice to have exotic that didn't do anything powerful; you sacrificed a powerful exotic for a quality of life change, and it was wonderful. 

What do we have now? ""While sprinting, movement speed is increased and energy weapons are automatically reloaded"". Well, the *movement speed* is still there, but the thing that made the Transversive Steps usable is just gone. To add to it, Energy weapons are reloaded *only a small amount of ammo* over a short period of sprinting. So, if your energy weapon is empty and you print for a few second, you will only have a small portion of your mag reloaded. Remember how I said in Destiny 1 I would forget I had the Steps on until I swapped classes? Well, I still forget I have them on, only now I never notice when I don't have them on; the perk is hot trash and it is currently a waste of an exotic slot. 

I want to revisit something I stated earlier, ""you sacrificed a powerful exotic for a quality of life change"". This is true, but only kind of. I have a hunch that Bungie changed them because of a high usage rate in PvE activities, making them look over powered. Lets look at the powerful warlock exotics - Just to list them off: Obsidian Mind, Ophidian Aspects, Purifier Robes, The Ram, Nothing Manacles, The Stag. These are the best of the best warlock exotics, but theres something specific about their strength; its (nearly) *all* PvP exotics. The best exotics the warlock has are great for PvP, but *not* PvE. 

In that list, we can pick out The Ram (neutral, we'll say), Obsidian Mind, Ophidians, and Purifier Robes as potential PvE exotics. Two of these are great for Voidwalker (The Ram and Obsidian Mind), but we all know sunsinger was almost exclusively used, so those are thrown out. Blinding trash mobs isn't really useful, so Purifier Robes is out as well. Ophidians are great, I'm sure they were used a lot. They are *less* useful in PvE, but they'll work. We're left with *one* decent PvE exotic. Of the powerful exotics for warlock, *one* was passable as a decent PvE exotic. Of course Transversive Steps would have high usage rates in PvE, there was nothing good for PvE.

Why was the Transversive Steps changed? I don't know. Maybe because Bungie hates fun, maybe it just had really high usage rate so they're clearly overpowered and thats just not allowed (or maybe there weren't any good exotics for PvE so people used the Steps)? All I know, is they gutted a quality of life exotic, the only useful PvE exotic the warlock has ever had, and made it a waste of an exotic slot.

TL;DR - The Transversive Steps were a quality of life change that came at the expense of your exotic slot. They were the only warlock exotic that was useful in PvE, while the rest of them thrived in PvP (while being terrible in PvP). Warlock had only one PvE exotic and Bungie pooped on them."

[Spoilers] What we learned in S2E6 - Phase Space,486,723,False,False,False,westworld,1527472666.0,True,"I really enjoyed this episode. We got some important information, had some truly great scenes, and the plot moved forward in a compelling way. Here's some new insights we got; a lot more happened, but these were revelations that answered some questions or backfilled in our understanding of various characters. 


**Dolores is programming and testing and Arnold bot**

This confirms a theory that's been floating around since the first episode, that the opening scene of the season was not Arnold and Dolores in the past, but rather Dolores and a host Arnold in the present. This may also be indication that the Jeffrey Wright that wakes up on the beach is not Bernard, but a different Arnold-Bot, although this has not been confirmed. 

**William thinks his daughter is a host**

Apparently he's become genre-aware. He could be right, we don't technically know for sure if she's a guest or not, although I would lean towards her being human. 

**Climate control is working**

Thank. God. Could you even imagine the mesa without A/C? Miserable. 

**More about the Cradle**

We had heard mention of the cradle before, but we didn't really know what it was. It was supposed to be a back up where simulations of stories can be run, but it has gained a consciousness of sorts; responding and adapting to changes in the code and interacting with all the park's systems. The cradle is not remotely accessible. 

**Japanese Armistice is sticking with Maeve and the gang**


Japanese Maeve and Hector stayed in Shogun world, but the Armistice equivalent went back to Westworld with Lee Sizemore et al. After the last episode, many hypothesized that some of the new characters would join up; looks like they were right. 

**William and Emily's relationship has been...difficult**

We got a lot of interaction between William and his daughter (whether or not she's human), which was great. She and her mother travelled to the parks with him when she was a child, but she hasn't been back for awhile (although this contradicts her familiarity with the current Raj storylines an the notebook, so maybe she's been visiting in secret.) She is concerned her father is planning suicide by robot.

**Maeve's daughter has new parents**

This one could have been predicted. When Maeve was reassigned to the Mariposa, her daughter stayed in her old storyline with a different host playing the mother. 

**New Teddy is  Stone Cold**

After his reprogramming by Dolores last week, Teddy hasn't got much heart left in him. We'll see how this pans out for Dolores' plans as it unfolds- she looked almost as concerned by his cold-bloodedness this week as she did by his mercy in episode three.

**Ford is inside the Cradle**

This explains a lot. It is likely how he is able to control all the hosts around William, and also explains why the cradle is so newly responsive. 


Note: This is based on my one (very recent and potentially not fully processed) viewing of Phase Space. I apologize for any minor misunderstandings/misrepresentations of the episode and let me know if I missed something major!"

When you want Fae but don't like Fae - a +10 Hawkeye build,14,85,False,False,False,FireEmblemHeroes,1527526725.0,True,"(Warning: I like to ramble.)

[Here he is.](https://imgur.com/LzglcNu)

I never actually intended to have this. I was pity broken by him a long time ago and left him alone, since he was +Speed. Then there was his BHB with Ninian, and I pulled on his banner, getting +Speed again. Frustrated, I pulled a lot more - and by the time I found a neutral Hawkeye, I had a 40+5 Hawkeye. My first **five** 5* Hawkeyes were +Speed. I got pity broken by him again, and then I decided I might as well finish him. Yesterday, I told my friend that I wasn't gonna finish him until I pulled my first -Spd copy, and I wanted Res out of the other stats. A minute later... I pulled that exact setup and was floored. He's done, finally.

And, yes. It took me **over a year** to pull a -Speed Hawkeye.

So, let's get this out of the way first: Hawkeye is generally worse than Fae in many ways. He's got 3 Defense on her, but he loses 1 HP and 6 Speed against her, so the most common approach is to either make him a mixed tank or to go in on his Defense. Since Fae has access to Lightning Breath+, she can fit in a Breath skill or any other A skill and reap huge dividends from it. Meanwhile, Hawkeye is forced to eat a Hector if he wants to be comparable on enemy phase.

However, I don't like Fae, and I love Hawkeye. So none of the above really matters to me. 

Green axers still have a good weapon variety. In fact, there are many good axes that Hawkeye can use, and most of them will work just fine with him. His innate Slaying Axe+ is super good for setting up huge Ignis/Glacies procs. The Xmas weapons are also very good, but I didn't want to give up either one for him. Finally, you can run Emerald Axe+ on him if you really want to bully Reinhardt, but with weapon refinery, that's fallen out of favor.

So, here's where I am.

IVs are **+Res -Spd**. He's supported with Sophia, because I know she's gonna either get a good refine, or red serpent will be released. 

I firmly believe any -Spd IVs are good on him and will allow the unit to function almost exactly the same. Pick any -Spd and go with it.

**Legion's Axe+** - probably the most unusual weapon choice considering 1) you generally want to ploy your enemies before fighting them, and 2) Hawkeye has access to many other great weapons, one which he comes with. However, I've played with it in T20 arena, and I'm very happy with the results.

Hawkeye can demolish emblem teams of any variety with this. It's very rare for teams to include 2 red units, and most of the problematic emblem units are blue (Rein, Effie, Hardin, VaLyntine, Nowi, F!Morgan, Cordelia) or green (Grima, Hector, Amelia, Sheena, Fae, Myrrh, etc.), leaving Hawkeye in a pretty good spot this meta. 

The idea is that you position him to fight a blue and a green unit - the AI will generally attack with the green unit first, who Hawkeye can proc Aether on if he's doubled. You can do the same thing with Slaying Axe+ and Ignis/Glacies. But, I want him to tank multiple units, and he needs HP from Aether to use QR3. He'll then wreck the blue unit who is debuffed and at a disadvantage. 

The other nice thing about this setup is that it gives Hawkeye a player phase purpose, allowing him to support his teammates against everyone, including red units. It screws up Bladetomes badly, too. Be mindful that Hawkeye has fairly modest Attack despite those incredible muscles, so you will generally need a special proc for anything running Fury, even green mages.

Finally, I have Panic Ploy as a C and of course as the seal, but this somewhat allows me to free up those slots for other things, which I really like.

**Reposition** - obvious

**Aether** - it's not just for points, although that's a huge benefit. Hawkeye being slow means he gets more chances to proc it, and the heal is great to keep him in QR3 range. With Serra support, he has yet to fail me against a non-red.

He does reach 51 Resistance with this setup, so Glacies is no joke on him, and he can demolish reds with it. It’s all about what you want I guess.

**Warding Breath** - I hate dragons. This, alongside Legion's Axe+, allows me to shred dragon emblem teams fairly effortlessly. He can even tank most Tiki builds fairly reliably with this. Steady Breath is also fine and generally preferable. If you need him to kill the fairly common green mages in arena, you can run DC instead, which I often do.

**Quick Riposte 3** - I gave this to him before the seal existed. At first I regretted it, but the more I played him, the more I was thankful for this. The second A slot skill in the seal is far more valuable.

He needs Quick Riposte somewhere to function. He's good whether that's in B or in his seal. QR2 is usable, but since Hawkeye has a massive HP pool, being able to proc QR3 in a wider HP range has been very useful for me.

I will say, one bonus of using it in the seal slot is that you can then run G Tomebreaker and guarantee that you kill Gronnblade+.

**Infantry Pulse** - I am running a one-shot build with Lute and Karel. Don't judge me. 

Do whatever you want here. If you want to play him on mixed teams, like I do, give him Spd Tactic 3. 

With this Res-based Hawkeye, he runs double ploys beautifully, even screwing up mages that often like to use ploys themselves. I favor Atk+Def ploy on him, because Lute has Spd+Res. And there's always Panic Ploy. Oh, but if you run these ploys, you don't want to use Legion's Axe+. Not like you were gonna use it anyway.

You can also run double smokes on him effectively. I don't because I run Fear+ on Serra and have Spd Ploy on Lute, but I think this might be his most effective general setup with Legion's Axe+, just for insurance. 

**Close Def 3 seal** - makes him unkillable to every non-red except maybe some stupid Bold Fighter 3 Hector. Use Distant Defense 3 if you run DC.

[Practical (and probably more effective) build that I use often](https://imgur.com/7JvG8fc) - Slaying Axe+ with refine matching his boon, Reposition, Ignis/Glacies, Distant Counter, Quick Riposte 3, Panic Ploy, Distant Defense 3 seal.

Happy to answer any questions, although I may be slow with responses."

**Notes**

Out of the 27 players, it is pretty much certain that Trapp will not go to Russia. He has an outsider chance if Neuer is unfit, but the problem is not the fitness but rather match experience. Upfront, one of Petersen and Gómez is likely to not make the world cup, and Gómez experience and recent trend upwards since moving back to Stuttgart is likely to give him the advantage. One CB is likely to stay at home, because this squad has 5 CBs and that's more than you need - Süle has performed almost to the level of Hummels and Boateng at club level, Rüdiger has been very reliable and Löw has trusted him in the past, which likely leaves Tah out of the squad, mostly because Ginter has experience as RB which Germany has no real alternative for right now. However the last 2 test matches might involve a race between Rüdiger and Tah. And finally, Rudy has not been impressive, in a team that tends to be stacked in the midfield - but the DM position is one Germany has been lacking a bit. Leaving Rudy at home would mean Germany travels to Russia without a proper 6, trusting Khedira as most defensive option despite him being more a box to box player. Kroos and Gündoğan, while stellar players, provide comparatively little defensive stability, especially when paired with another. This lack of DM could mean Rudy makes the cut, leaving someone else out of squad - likely Brandt, as wingers are one of Germany's least concerns.

#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch

 * **[Marco Reus](https://www.transfermarkt.com/marco-reus/profil/spieler/35207)**

Reus' story is almost a tragedy at this point, but one that seems to be able to have a happy ending. [His injury record](https://www.transfermarkt.com/marco-reus/verletzungen/spieler/35207#) is painfully long even for neutral fans, he's been out for give or take 18 months in the last 4 years. And to add insult to injury, said injuries forced him out of both the EC2016 and the WC2014. Despite being constantly back up to speed, he just keeps getting injured again and again. After coming back from a ruptured cruciate ligament just this January, he seems to finally have a trouble free run into a big tournament. Despite being constantly delivering and being thought to be maybe Germany's most talented outfield player, he just won his first major trophy last year after Borussia Dortmund defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 in the German cup final. Now one year later, Reus will look to add a world cup title to his name, one everyone thinks he should've been part of 4 years ago already.

 * **[Jonas Hector](https://www.transfermarkt.com/jonas-hector/profil/spieler/108537)**

4 years ago, Germany's defence was focused around CBs, playing their abundance of CBs as FB while using one of the best FBs of all time with Lahm as DM. After Mustafi's injury, Lahm moved back onto his main RB position, but that still kept Höwedes at LB despite actually being a CB. It worked, but with players retiring the search for FBs was on. That year, in 2014, was Hector's 2nd year at a professional football level, despite already being 24 years old. And only a few months after the WC win, Hector would make his first appearance for the German NT, fortifying his position as starting LB in the squad. Out of all the 11 players Germany is likely to start, he is by far the lowest profile player, also because he enjoys keeping a low profile. Most notably seen with his devotion to his club, 1. FC Köln, who put him into the world of professional football, now being repaid by Hector staying with the club despite their relegation to the German 2nd division. Since him and Kimmich are likely the lowest profile players in the German squad, it is rather likely that opponents will target that as a possible weakness, so the performance of Hector, the worldwide rather unknown player, will be key in order for Germany to have the stable defence needed to win a tournament.

 * **[Thomas Müller](https://www.transfermarkt.com/thomas-muller/profil/spieler/58358)**

*World Cup Müller* has become a meme, and rightfully so. With 5 goals and 3 assists, he won the Golden Boot in 2010, and with the very same performance of 5 goals and 3 assists he won the Silver Boot in 2014 - only behind his now teammate James Rodríguez. With 6 goals in 2018, he could equal his countryman Klose's record of most goals at a WC with 16, despite having played a world cup less. And the ""world cup buff"" has already started to show at club level, where Müller started to score more of his trademark awkward goals. People will have their eyes on him, and if he can live up to the hype of past tournaments - he will certainly have to in the later stages to give Germany a chance at a successful title defence.

#[](#icon-whistle-big) Potential Starting XI

                       Neuer
    Kimmich  -  Boateng  -  Hummels  -  Hector
                  Kroos  -  Khedira
             Müller  -  Özil  -  Reus
                      Werner

The starting XI has surprisingly little controversy, no one would fancy Sané over Reus, Neuer will player over ter Stegen if he goes to the WC, Werner is clearly the first choice striker, the only uncertainty is the midfield and who pairs up with Kroos - Khedira or Gündoğan. But since Gündoğan and Kroos combined have shown very little defensive stability in friendlies so far, the choice is more likely to be Khedira.

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

 * **The Goalkeeper**

By far the most interesting question going into the tournament is - who will be Germany's 1st choice keeper? Luckily for Germany, it is the first world problem of all first world problems. Will they use Manuel Neuer, the best goalkeeper in the world whenever healthy, world cup and golden glove winner of 2014, and Champions League winner of 2013? Or will they use Marc-André ter Stegen, Confed Cup winner of 2017, and Champions League winner of 2015? There is not really a question that Neuer bests everyone when he's in proper form, but he effectively hasn't played in more or less a year. Saving grace for Neuer might be that fitness apparently is not an issue, and with 2 test games against Austria and Saudi Arabia, Neuer might be able to prove that his game is on point. Ter Stegen however has played an amazing season with Barcelona, won the double, and has been a top 5 keeper in the world for a while now. His match practice is as good as it gets, and since his quality is beyond any doubt, it will be very interesting if Löw trusts the potentially better keeper with less practice, or the still extremely good keeper with more practice.

My personal and very own opinion on that matter is that Löw will likely test Neuer in the remaining games, and try him out in the group stag, and Neuer will be up to the task. People will forget that it was even controversial going into the tournament. When on form, Neuer is straight up irreplacible, and Löw will want one of his best weapons when going up against the big guns later on.

 * **The Fullbacks and Defensive Midfield**

Now this talking point is relevant because it covers Germany's biggest potential weaknesses. First, the fullbacks with Kimmich and Hector are probably the two most unproven players in the starting eleven. Everyone else is a big name on the world stage, those two are a hyped up youngster (Kimmich) or straight up unknown (Hector).

Kimmich has shown a trendemous drive forward, not only assisting countless chances and goals from the right wing for both club and country, but also scoring quite a few himself. However, his defensive abilities aren't always on point, which puts the team at a decent risk to concede through his side. Hector on the other side is a far more conservative player, with less drive forward, but also a lot more actual defending. However Hector will be crucial in supporting Reus on the left side, as it is likely to be one of Germany's biggest weapons in this tournament. Both FBs will have to play their hearts out to compete against the very strong wingers fielded by the best teams of the tournament.

But not only the FBs make Germany's defence potentially a liability, also the lack of a proper DM can prove to be costly. The CM is likely to be a pair of either Kroos / Khedira or Kroos / Gündoğan, both of which are very attacking choices. Kroos is an 8 and not a 6, albeit one of the best in the world, and both Khedira and Gündoğan are more box to box players than actual DMs.  This is a very potent fielding moving up the field, but is a formation that can have issues against the ball, as well as being bypassed with a decent through ball. The fact that the central part of the field is backed up by Hummels &amp; Boateng, one of the best CB pairings not only in this tournament but even on club level, helps covering up over this weakness, as even the extended squad has just one proper DM - if he even travels to Russia.

It will be interesting to see how Löw copes with these rather structural weaknesses, and if other teams can be set up in a way to abuse it. 

 * **The Legacy**

Germany's trophy case ands records speak for themselves. With 4 titles out of 8 final appearances and at least a bronze medal at every WC this millenium, expectations are obviously high. The worst exit in post WW2 history have come in the RO8, even matching this would be seen a failure, so a semi final just has to be achieved to not disappoint. And onto that, starting the tournament as defending world champions, the pressure will be huge, as even the bookies have Germany ranked #2 just slightly behind Brazil, yet slightly ahead of France and Spain.

While Germany is no weaker than in 2014, it is important to see that everyone else is a whole lot stronger now, especially Spain and Brazil, but also France who was a very young and mixed squad 4 years ago, they all are on a different planet compared to their showings of 4 years ago. So will this German side be enough to carry on the legacy of former teams? Time will tell, but pressure and expectations are there. Germany rarely excelled with individual quality and usually came out ahead on spirit and tactics, and sometimes even luck like every good tournament run. The squad should be experienced enough to deal with everything, but is it still hungry enough? Can Germany get into the right mindset which usually has been on of the teams biggest strengths?

Not just the team, but the fans too. This is my first year watching basketball. Never had an interest before, but after going away to college and going to a few games with my friends, I really got into it and wanted to watch the best play. So I chose a team. I knew nothing about any teams, other than that the Lakers used to be great and LeBron was on the Cavs. I didn’t want to be just another LeBron fanboy, so i chose the team with the only other player i knew somewhat well, Kyrie Irving. That team was the Boston Celtics.

Well, needless to say I had no idea when I started watching this team that they already had 17 banners and a great team going into this year. I had no idea Gordon Hayward was injured minutes into the season and that our outlook was grim. I didn’t start following till about a quarter of the way  through the season, so my understanding of what had happened was limited. But man, did this team not disappoint, and I sure learned a lot. 

I learned that Marcus Smart can miss every shit and still make winning plays. I learned both of the Jays are simultaneously as good as and better than LeBron and Jordan. That Terry is indeed scary. Marcus Morris can be the most frustrating player to watch due to his blindness and inability to pass the ball, but love it when he makes a contested shot and the energy he brings. I learned that Big Al is anything but average. But most of all I have learned that this team was pure magic. 

I have never once before been so attached to any team.

I think I have real life examples of the tech most of the operators use! Let's start with lion!

Long post, TL;DR at bottom 


Lion: active acoustic mapping

Lion's drone most likely works using an acoustic camera paired with a literal subwoofer to create an active acoustic map of the area. The map continuously updates during the dubste- I mean scan phase, and highlights sound anomalies (aka footsteps and gunshots) in the terrain. The drone also would reference a location feed to filter out moving members of the assault team.

This tech has been around forever, and it has been proven in 2011 that caves can be mapped using an acoustic camera set up to use gunshot reverberations, or a portable subwoofer! 
[source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028156-000-gunshot-echoes-used-to-map-caves-interior/amp/) 

It's actually very realistic that a drone could be outfitted with an acoustic 
camera, onboard computer and a skrillex cd! From there, a program could be used to take data from the scan, reference it against friendly locations, so your allies don't show up red, and literally draw an acoustic outline of anomalies (enemies) on a hud for friendly operators. This would also explain why mute jammers can jam his drone, since they also emit a constant noise while operating to create white noise ;) in their area of effect.


TL;DR 

EE-1D uses an acoustic camera and high powered sub to map the area and highlight anomalies (footsteps &amp; loud noise) and their shape. Mute's jammers create enough white noise to hide movement noise with their operating tone."

Stopped chasing the latest shooters, so 4x60 per year. 

Oh and it's lite on my computer. So the same PC I built 6-7 years ago for 1.2k handles it perfectly. 

So it's safe to say this game saves me anywhere from 300- 600 bucks per year.

Plus I genuinely really enjoy it, coming home from a stressful day and playing a comp relaxes me so much.

**~ Comparing Emblem Teams ~**

-

Which Emblem team is the most powerful in Arena Offense?

-	(32.5%) Cavalry
-	(30.9%) Flier
-	(18.9%) Dragon
-	(15.2%) Armor

-

Unsurprisingly, Arena Offense favors the player-phase teams …

-

Which Emblem team is the most powerful in Arena Defense?

-	(34.5%) Armor
-	(30.0%) Dragon
-	(28.1%) Cavalry
-	(4.5%) Flier

-

… While Arena Defense favors the enemy-phase teams.

-

Which Emblem team is the strongest overall?

-	(33.2%) Dragon
-	(30.5%) Armor
-	(15.8%) Cavalry
-	(15.6%) Flier

-

The enemy-phase teams seem to be favored as the strongest overall. These results may also be due to factors like Dragon's adaptive damage, and Armor's powerful Fighter skills.

-

Which Emblem team is the most versatile in terms of available units, roles, and playstyle?

-	(42.2%) Cavalry
-	(40.4%) Flier
-	(9.4%) Dragon
-	(6.6%) Armor

-

The player-phase teams are favored in terms of versatility in available units and playstyle, though.

-

If you had to invest in only one Emblem team for the rest of the game, which one would it be?

-	(41.9%) Flier
-	(22.5%) Dragon
-	(16.5%) Armor
-	(15.2%) Cavalry

-

23.2% say that the terrain on the maps in the current Arena rotation influence their use of Emblem teams, compared to 73.6% who say they do not.

-

50.0% believe Infantry units should be given their own suite of Emblem buffs, compared to 38.6% who do not.

-

51.5% say they are more likely to use a cavalry/flier/armor/dragon in a mixed team than they are in an Emblem team, compared to 44.2% who are more likely to use these units in Emblem teams than mixed teams.

-

19.4% find that cavalry/flier/armor/dragon units lack synergy outside of an Emblem team, compared to 76.7% who do not.

-

85.9% would like cavalry/flier/armor/dragon units to have more skills that synergize with units outside of an Emblem team, compared to 7.2% who do not.

-

Cavalry Emblem and Flier Emblem are almost always built as Player Phase, or as Mixed Phase about half as often, but almost never as Enemy Phase. Conversely, Armor Emblem and Dragon Emblem are almost always built as Enemy Phase, or as Mixed Phase about half as often, but almost never as Player Phase.

TL;DR at bottom

Bandit: drug fueled instant electric fence device.

Let's start with how an electric fence works. An electric fence works off a 12v (usually) source and an energizer, as well as a ground stake. The energizer converts the battery power into high voltage pulses and sends them through the metal fencing at 1 second intervals to the ground stake down the line. The process is interrupted when an animal or particularly drunk human comes into contact and creates an easier ground connection, and gets shocked. 

Bandit went full crackhead and turned that idea up to 11. He took a car battery (12.6v source), mated it with a cattle energizer (not a taser one), hooked up jumper cables, and welded on some carrying handles to make an electric fence in a box. The pulse in an electric fence is meant to work with thick dry cowhide, so it has no problem going right through an operator's clothes and gloves, and shorting drones.

The only thing they might have done wrong with bandit is that breaching charges use electric blasting caps, and it's very possible the pulse would set off the blasting cap as soon as the charge touched the wall. What probably should happen is premature detonation of the c4 part of thermite's charge if he is stupid enough to put it on an electrified wall.

TL;DR 

bandit has an electric fence in a box using a car battery, energizer, and jumper cables. Thermites that try to place on electrified walls should get instantly blown up, so literally unplayable or some stuff."

Q posted the word chapters. About 1 week later, WikiLeaks released the downloadable PDF of the book Fire &amp; Fury with the O's in all the chapters replaced with q's.

Q posted the word F5. Later on in the month, Julian Assange released the image of a famous chess game, where the next chess move would be placing a piece into the position of a F-5.

TL;DR at bottom.

Jâger: highly modified Israeli Trophy LV

So the way trophy systems work is they use a tactical control radar to detect incoming projectiles, and a fire control radar to get a path of travel. A program immediately calculates an azimuth to intercept, orients the barrel and fires a literal buckshot shell to eliminate the threat. This happens in milliseconds and can intercept rpg rounds that travel 300 m/s. Newer designs can do this with multiple projectiles at once.

The lightest declassified trophy system Is around 440 lbs, whole system (multiple launchers, 360 flat panel antennas etc).

Jàger's ads only needs to intercept a maximum of a grenade launcher round traveling 76 m/s. This means we can cut out a lot of weight on our computer, since it tracks slower projectiles. We can also cut out a large amount of weight on  the tactical and fire control radar because they only have to track a projectile within a small radius, and at relatively slow speeds, and this is before we get into the idea of using laser or optical projectile tracking, which would be lighter. With all this considered, Jæger's ads could probably do its job and weigh less than 50lbs using lightweight materials. And that good old German ingenuity.

TL;DR Jãger's ads probably weighs 30-50 lbs and can track slower (less than 100m/s) projectiles using a combination of a small array of tactical control radars and an optical projectile tracker. It shoots buckshot, and the most unrealistic part is that the suction cups stick to anything that's not your mom :P"

Make it a Valve store only thing and not marketable or trade-able or gift-able, but for the love of god, take my money and let me have the map please.

I know you're going through a lot right now, please find this message well.

For all of you who have Immortal Gardens, please up-vote for those of us who don't. We just want to be the same as everyone else. 
Equal maps for equal play.

Edit 1) I understand it said exclusive. Maybe if they released one to be sold it could say ""Not to be confused with the 'exclusive' Immortal Garden awarded to T16 BP oweners"" I'm not asking for a Pipe of Dezun filled with crushed up baby jade Roshan's here, I just want my ~two hours a day of Dota to be on a map that I love, that yes, reminds me of TI. 

Edit 2) Don't you think the person(s) who made Immortal Garden would want as many people as possible to enjoy their beautifully made map? It's an asset that's just sitting there that could easily be added to the steam store with a hefty price tag, and for all of you ""I don't want your map to look good because It said exclusive and that's life"" have some compassion for the guy with the crystals all over his map. 

Last Edit) Okay. I give. It said exclusive, you're right. It isn't fair for me to be able to buy it. I'll make do with what I have. That point is abundantly clear, and if that's the end all be all of this request, then so be it. I'll go buy the Monkey map and use my imagination."

Source: https://weibo.com/910317000?profile_ftype=1&amp;is_all=1#1527506188930


Later, Tiange ""Dove"" Zhang, official talent for MarsTV, stated in Weibo that:

&gt; 新EG马上就到了别急阿 每个人大家都很熟很熟很熟但是绝对想不到

Translate: New EG is coming soon, don't worry about that. You know every person very well but may never think of them being in new EG roster.


and: 

&gt; 别猜了真的不是Optic

Translate: Stop guessing it is not Optic.

Source: https://weibo.com/627327927?profile_ftype=1&amp;is_all=1#_0

(The latter is posted before the first one, but I just adjusted the sequence so it is easier to understand) 


-------
Opinion: 

I believe these two ""tweets"" are correlated. A new EG roster is very likely to make results of Supermajor influential. And they are posted at almost the same time. Perhaps, EG could bring in stand-ins that would earn points for their team, making it top 8.

Due to their status as dota staff, I believe their statements are reliable.

Edit: ""(On DPC Rankings)"" in the title is my guess, but there's good reason to believe that Chenya means DPC rankings.

Edit 2: Dove first said "" stop guessing it isn't Optic"", perhaps in reply to Chen ya's post, meaning that EG would not withdraw from SM to make place for Optic. Then she said ""new EG coming"". That's to say, we can not exclude the odds that the stand-ins may be from Optic. I am to blame for this misleading.

Besides, Dove did confirm, in a comment, that EG is not going to withdraw.

--------------------------------
Update:
https://www.facebook.com/notes/og/a-shift-in-og/2052592141695413/

S4 and Flyby joined EG, and OG has withdrawn from SuperMajor.
There will be a make-up spot, creating uncertainty to DPC rankings.

Is Jump Fatigue Necessary? Hear Me Out...,410,3537,False,False,False,FortNiteBR,1527464897.0,True,"Before you click away, this isn’t a “Epic PLZ unlimited Jumpz!” thread. I want to understand if other players feel the mechanic serves its purpose and is or isn’t a necessity. 

Is jump fatigue necessary?

It was probably implemented to stop jump spamming in general, but has it?

 Watch literally any streamer... when they sprint they jump, jump, sprint for 0.5 seconds and double jump again, repeat. 

When people fight, they jump constantly. Good players time their jumps with the smallest delay possible and manage to maintain solid and consistent jump height. 

Good players are using jump and working around delay to do exactly what jump fatigue is supposed to prevent, now let’s get to the real problem since it’s mostly avoidable in every other scenario. 

Where does jump fatigue literally get even the best players killed...? Build battles. 

We’ve all been in a situation where we’re getting our build destroyed and we’re building up to stand a chance when suddenly you can’t make it onto your own ramp because your feet are glued to the floor. You have to jump when you rotate to build up and depending on how many people are shooting you out; you don’t have time to stop. 

This is the only situation where I even notice jump fatigue exists. It feels bad because it’s often unavoidable. 

I don’t believe it’s a necessary mechanic at all. The game is already functioning in a Halo-esque jump battle meta. It doesn’t affect the face to face battles. We already have no fatigue sprint. Is it at all necessary?

What are your thoughts on this mechanic? Does it make the game better? 

TL;DR Jump delay doesn’t affect the shotgun battles between good players. It doesn’t stop people from jump spamming across the map. It just gets people killed when they’re building in high pressure situations. "

These Challenge Tokens are literally letting 2k players get ancient 5 - they're going to take the value out of all badges below Divine.,283,585,False,False,False,DotA2,1527476751.0,True,"Was watching my friend's 5 stack and saw a case of 2 2k's literally getting boosted from 2k to ancient 5 by 3 low divine/high ancient players.

Proof:

https://imgur.com/a/KMdivR0

I've never taken party mmr seriously as any kind of skill measuring metric and this precisely shows why, just amplified 12x fold (+300 mmr for win, -25 for loss). The only problem is that in the past, you could see if someone was 2k solo and 5k party or 5k solo and 2k party (the latter obviously being more skilled) in your games - now there's asymmetric info in the way of badges, making them an absolute useless indication of your achievement/skill in game at this point.

Even though I'm above the medal threshold for this to affect me, it still really annoys me thinking how I had to grind over the years to get to where I am and this bullshit is now possible. Please remove this feature.

Edit: Copying a reply I made for people asking me why solo mmr &gt; party mmr.

Simply put, just because it's a team game, it doesn't mean there's no individual skill to it. Outside of the pro scene, solo queue, though it has its flaws, is by far the best measure of individual ability to have game impact as it randomizes most other factors you can't control for (your teammates) - it's why all pro players grind solo to practice. 

Party mmr doesn't control/randomize the impact of your teammates. meaning that the mmr you get is a show of the COMBINED game impact of players you CHOOSE to play with. If me + 4 EG players = 8 k party, where all i do is pick lich and try not to be a retard, does that make me 8k in skill level? That's the reason no one in the competitive scene takes party mmr seriously; even more so now - they just goof around in these stacks. They are an absolute horrible representation of individual skill; I guarantee someone w. 2k solo and 6k party will get absolutely dumpstered by someone 4k solo 3k party.

**Please, sorry for bad english in this translate**

&gt; After I felt a little better in, I decided to write a few words about my kick.
All the time when i be in Gambit nobody sayed about my problems. Because of this, the situation became very unpleasant and shocking for me.

&gt; 3 days before the tournament, in DH Tours tournament some players said: ""your tactics are complex and we want to play easier"". There was a feeling that some players took offense at me.

&gt; In the tournament after lose AGO, one player said: ""I dont want to play in this roster"". But he said about roster with me. We conferred and decided to make Captain Mishu [Dosia].  And I had to play in such an atmosphere for two more months.

&gt; This became insulting only for two reasons:
1) How I looked to all inside: We did not have a good training recently. I was sure, if we started training then the results would be better.
2) I didnt like what was happening inside the team. I cant to disclose details.

&gt; But, I want to say thanks to my ex. teammates. This 4 months was beatiful for me. 

&gt; My contract with Gambit end in december 2018. In this period of time I will play FaceIt and streaming. Waiting for offers from CIS, EU, NA.

I know he had a bad game 7, but he was way more efficient that Tatum in these playoffs, made twice as many threes at a way higher percentage, and played better defense than Tatum. 

Tatum is still a rook and Jaylen is a sophomore, but I weirdly think Jaylen has a higher ceiling. "

[META] End of Season Discussion; Summer Transfer Threads; Rule Reminders and Coming Changes; and a Thank You From the Mods,66,91,False,False,True,LiverpoolFC,1527519392.0,True,"#**Well that was a bit of a shit ending.**

Obviously, we're all frustrated at the conclusion, but I struggle to think of a more enjoyable season in recent memory, both for sub and club. I think we can also agree that the future looks very bright indeed for us. 

We started out this year with around 59,000 subscribers to the subreddit and are now looking very seriously at becoming the most subscribed club-specific football sub on the entirety of reddit. For that, we humbly thank each and every one of you for making this sub what it normally is.

... That being said, recently, it's been a bit of a predictable dumpster fire, especially since the game ended.

To address this, we are planning on bringing in additional moderators to help deal with the flow. We've already added /u/jesuspunk and he's been helpful, I guess.

___
**New Mods**

We're looking for the following things in potential new moderators

* **Be in Good Standing in r/LiverpoolFC** If you've been banned in the past for trolling, being a dickhead to other people on the sub, regular post removal, there is little need to apply. Despite the large volume of users, the moderators are aware of our ""problem children"".
* **Experience** Experience moderating at any level is appreciated, but if you have experience in moderating high volume subreddits, then that is preferable.
* **Time Zone Coverage** Currently, our moderator team consists primarily of people located in Great Britain and the United States, however, we do have to sleep sometime, and it would be great if we could get some coverage from people in Australia, Asia, Eastern and Central Europe, and the Pacific Isles. 
* **Fluent in English.** As you've no doubt noticed, this subreddit is conducted almost exclusively in English, and a moderator will need to be able to explain why posts are removed or a user has been banned.
* **Familiar with coding, especially CSS** While we have a number of moderators who are capable of updating the sidebar and banner heading, they get busy, and the rest of us layabout moderators just kind of twiddle our thumbs in their absence.

* If you have additional skills that you feel are relevant, feel free to include in in your application, which we will post as a google poll in the coming days.

___
**Rules**

With the recent subscriber boom we've seen a lot of rule violations, and while we like the vivaciousness and the willingness to post these things, especially during such an exciting period for the club, it's time that we bring the posting quality back up to where it should be.

Whether you're a new subscriber or an old one, now is a great time to (re)familiarize yourself with the rules of our subreddit, which can be found in the sidebar, under ""FAQs"", and ""Full Sub Rules"". For now, [I'll happily just link you to them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/5r2p9q/rliverpoolfc_rules/) We will be updating the rules during the summer, in an attempt to refocus and clarify some of the rulings that needed to be adopted on the fly, so keep an eye out for those changes.

While you're reading this, however, I'd like to remind our users of some rules that are frequently violated.

1. No Memes, Image Macros, or Reaction Gifs
 * The above will be removed from this Subreddit to promote higher quality content. (This does come with a caveat, which is to say that if the memes are OC and obviously took a lot of effort and are good, they may be left alone.)

2. No low effort content
 * Similar to Justice Potter Stewart's concurrence in the [United States Supreme Court case Jacobellis v. Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it), I know it when I see it is the most commonly used thought process for the moderators. Most posts that fall under this should be placed as comments in the [Daily Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/8mnwp2/daily_discussion_20180528/), which will usually be stickied at the top of the sub. It is impossible for us to list out every single thing that would be deemed low effort, but here are a few ideas to get you thinking:

      Banned Content | Why
---|---
Pictures of your new kit, mug, flag, house interior. | Yes, you spent a lot of money on it, but we all did that, too.
Match reactions outside of match threads.|John Moss is a cunt; so is Ramos, but we don't need 400 threads dedicated to that fact.
Player appreciation threads|Sadio Mané is a God; so is van Dijk, but we don't need 400 threads dedicated to that fact.
Pictures of the Ribena/Irn Bru you bought|It wasn't really that clever when the first guy posted it. Since then 6,000 others have.
Posting content to complain about it|If it's so shit that your only comment is how shit it is, then don't subject other people to that shit.

        You get the picture; there's a lot of stuff out there that's deemed low effort. We'd like to see more discussion based threads that actually have some thought put into the original post, which lead to lively discussion and friendly arguments.

3. No derivatives as new posts.
 * This one can be a little tricky to get a handle on; it doesn't mean that each article on a given subject has to go on one thread, i.e. Melissa Reddy, Chris Bascombe, and James Pearce's write up on a new target can all have their own thread, as the content of each article will vary enough due to the fact that each writer will have different thought processes. Derivatives are posts that, at their heart, are the same day in and day out, and they are primarily user submitted text posts. Things like, ""What now for Karius?"" ""Does Klopp sell Karius?"" ""Do we need to go for a better keeper?"" are all examples of derivative posts. The thought process is the same, and usually these are accompanied without a lot of analysis or thought behind them. Please use the search bar, (it's at the top right of your screen,) and a relevant, but generic search term, like ""Karius"" and sort by ""New"" before submitting something like this. It's likely someone has posed a variation of your question.

4. No brigading or trolling other rival subreddits. Doing so results in a permanent ban.
 * This is a newer change, added before the Manchester United game earlier this season. The goal was to address cross-subreddit trolling at a bigger level, as us banning someone from another sub here doesn't really carry any punishment for them. The United sub, and several others, have created similar rules. We can say that we have seen a decrease in trolling on our sub and they have seen similar decreases on theirs. You can still banter with users on neutral subs like r/soccer.

**You'll Never Wildly Speculate Alone**

Finally, the Summer edition of [You'll Never Wildly Speculate Alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/8jvxyw/ynwsa_summer_2018/) is up and running, run by our very own u/LokiAkai. It will be pinned to the top of the subreddit for most of the off-season, with the occasional removal for World Cup threads. Please use that as your one stop shop for our summer business dealings, and provide Loki with all of your wildest, non-banned sources, so that we can all shovel, F5, and hope in solidarity. Before you panic, though, here's an updated [Transfer Reliability Guide.](https://i.imgur.com/OrDjbxh.jpg) While this isn't the end all be all, and there could be some additional changes/updates to it, this will be what we work with for now.

That's all for now. Thanks for a great season, r/LiverpoolFC."

"Lebron is averaging 34/9.2/8.8/1.4/1.1 on 61.9%TS in the playoffs. He is leading the league in minutes (both regular season and playoffs), and is about to play the longest season of his career",11,57,False,False,False,nba,1527533661.0,True,"His eFG of 58.2% is the third highest in his career, trailing ‘14 and ‘16. His ppg is second to 2009, but he’s out scored his teammates at a career rate. He has outscored the other starters on his team 6 times, and he has never done that even 5 times before. Incredible. His mid range game has been on fire and he’s played great defense whenever it’s needed to win games. Speaking of games, he played 82 games this year in the regular season for the first time and has already played 18 in the playoffs. 100 games in a year ties the most hes ever played. In 2011 he also played 100 games after losing in the finals. He will play at least 104 games this year, the most in his career.

Other notable advanced stats: 33.1 PER is second to 2009, WS/48 is .291, second to 2009, his 14.7 BPM is second to 2009, and his 3.1 VORP is tied with 2016 for second to 2011. He any counting stats in his career are likely to be surpassed this year since a 5 game finals series would tie his longest playoff run ever. Very possible stats of averages may fall a bit since it seems it would be difficult to maintain such efficiency and volume in the finals, but I guess we’ll see!"

How will you remember this Real Madrid team?,232,68,False,False,False,soccer,1527527753.0,True,"I'm asking this because with 4 out of 5 CL titles (more impressive than 3 in a row imho) they are going to go down as one of those legendary teams people look back on decades from now. While I have an opinion of them (see below), it's only half-informed and I'd like to know more about them. I don't really follow La Liga and even though I've seen a fair share of their CL games, I haven't watched all of them and I don't really remember how they played in each year. 


So my question is to those who have followed RM more closely and have a better memory than me: how will you remember them? If someone asks you in 10 years what made them special, what will you answer? 

__________
For me, two things come to mind when I think of RM (feel free to agree or disagree):

1. Flexibility: My impression is they don't have a fixed style of play, they can and do win in different ways. Compare that to Barca at its best, you knew what the game would look like. 

2. They find a way: some call it efficiency or ruthlessness, but I'm not sure this encompasses everything. Perhaps I can describe it the easiest by saying what my thoughts were before a CL draw: When Barca was dominating, I thought ""I don't want them because they are simply better and that's why they will probably win"". With Real, I often think they are beatable, but also ""They will find a way to win"". They are not always better than the other team, they don't need to dominate (not saying they can't), but as someone rooting for the other team I always have a bad feeling when playing them. 

_________

Now if someone wants to share their thoughts or even has an article or a write-up about Real's last 5 CL-seasons, it'd be great to here. 

_________

What is your club's white whale?,314,136,False,False,False,soccer,1527514374.0,True,"There's that one trophy, that one achievement, the one thing your club seems to get inches from achieving but still fall short. Maybe it's the one trophy your cabinet it's lacking, or that Europa League spot that's just out of reach, or that promotion you've been thirsting for for years. Maybe your national team has lost in the RO16 for 6 editions in a row. Who knows? Spill it in the comments.

KV Mechelen were, until this spring, a first division Belgian team. As some of you might know, the Play Offs were introduced to our league in 2009. The jist of it is this: 

+ the top 6 teams fight for the league title among themselves (this process includes halving everyone's points because deciding a league by merit is *boring*)

+ the 7th to 14th teams play glorified friendlies among each other for a pathetic chance at playing Europa League

+ anyone lower than that gets to worry about relegation

the format became even more stupid and complicated but the jist of it remained the same. Finish top 6 or get bored to tears playing the kids against Moeskroen-Peruwelz in a game lacking any proper stakes or entertainment.

Of course, it is no surprise that every Belgium team wants to finish in the top 6. KV Mechelen, a recently promoted but stable side at the start of this tale, were no different. Coming off losing the Belgian Cup final in May 2009, the teams smelled it was capable of more than stinking up mid table. Season 09-10 started promising, with the team standing in 5th place halfway through the regular season, but a mid season collapse ended all Play Off 1 hopes early.

Season 10-11 started with a surprise change in management. Peter Maes left the club because it ""lacked in ambition"" and was replaced by Marc Brys. What followed was a surprisingly competent season in which we stood proudly in the top 6 3 matchdays from the end, with the 3rd best defense in the league to boot. Fortunately, we couldn't keep it up and on the final match day, we were 7th, needing Standard Liège to drop points away to Beerschot to clinch 6th after all. 

Standard won 0-1. With 10 men. Thanks a lot, ratten.

No harm done, it was a great season nonetheless, on to season 11-12. This time, we shit the bed early and had a dull season in midtable with few memorable highlights. 9th place finish, Marc Brys gets sacked, next please.

12-13 started with incredibly average expectations, which were met entirely. 8th place finish, never looking like getting close to top 6, not bad, but forgettable.

13-14 was an absolute disaster in which we flirted with relegation, 2 managers later we're stranded in 13th position, back to square one.

14-15 and 15-16 were largely inconsistent years with horrid away performances, wasted potential and a lack of focus. By the end, we'd finished in Play Off 2 for the 7th year in a row, and it looked like we'd hit our ceiling.

Then came season 16-17. After having our manager snatched by Standard early in the season, we ended up hiring Yannick Ferrera. This was suddenly met by a great improvement in performance (we actually won some away games) and we stood in 6th place, again on the final match day. All we needed to was get a result on the field of AA Gent, who were 7th, to secure Play Off 1 without question.

What followed is one of the most spineless and pathetic displays I've seen in my Mechelen years. [Final score: AA Gent - KV Mechelen: 3-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxAHaGzUVnw). We never even came close to looking like scoring and half heartedly parked the bus without a proper game plan. We were annihilated, 7th place finish and back to Play Off 2 purgatory we go. 

In the end, it was still a stellar season and we had much hope for the future. After spending record amounts on players like Kolovos and Rob Schoofs in the summer, it's like the stars were finally aligning for us to *finally* play Play Off 1.

And then we were fucking relegated."

After just securing a trip to the finals they try to get Lebron to call his teammates trash and after that didn’t work they do the same to Ty Lue but this time in front of the entire team while receiving a trophy. You can’t make this stuff up.

Don’t blame Doris Burke though, she has a producer from ESPN telling her to ask that question and if she does not she is risking her job. The blame belongs to ESPN.

I would see him occasionally putting up big offensive numbers, then with his first game in Cleveland I really thought he could make a difference.  Fast forward to the playoffs and good lord he was awful.  It seems whenever he gets the ball he just makes an out of control move and puts up a tough shot that ultimately misses.

HERE ARE ALL THE TWISTED FACTS AND LIES EVIL BRENT MADE UP TO TRY AND RUIN BRANDON'S CAREER AGAIN. (THIS IS ALSO A PETITION TO FIRE SSJ. HE'S WAY TO TOXIC TO THIS COMMUNITY AT THIS POINT),11,145,False,False,False,Ice_Poseidon,1527519707.0,True,"Says Brandon called Sam a rapist but, he never did. All he did was sing along to a song that someone donated that had the words ""Sam Pepper is a rapist"".

Says that Brandon starts shit with people to appease reddit. Well so do Sam and Asian Andy. Basically everyone does for the jokes. It's not that serious. But once again he has to only point it out for Brandon to make him look bad. Sam starts shit with everyone but SSJ doesn't have a problem with that. Asian Andy talking shit about Sam pointing the cam at Ice for content, but SSJ doesn't have a problem with that.

Says Brandon caused him and Danquan to be arrested in San Fran uber incident. SSJ literally just made that shit up when everyone who was at that scene said otherwise. Brandon also stopped the guy from running over a bunch of joggers\(terrorist attack\). But SSJ wants to discredit it because Brandon got way too many appreciation threads about that for his liking.

Says Brandon sulks when he gets hate threads on reddit. But Brandon was just tired and went to sleep when all the hate threads were happening. SSJ just salty because there hasn't been much surveillance stream content and wants Brandon to provide it with 0&amp;#37; cut.

Says Brandon yelled ""why are you guys focused on me bitch"" to a cop. But that literally never happened. He's referring to the 1st trip where Brandon was just trying to get the cops attention to defuse the situation but did it in a polite manner. Not even 20mins before their argument yesterday a cop pulled up to the RV and it only took Brandon about 30seconds to defuse that situation and the cop just left. Making SSJ's ""ability to talk to cops"" useless again.

This is the same thing that happened when Brandon started streaming in September 2017. SSJ doesn't want Brandon to have his own channel to stream. He does this to everyone that he feels threatened by. Literally kicked Nikita out of a party for saying ""I love the police"".

SSJ provides nothing for Ice and only hurts his career. Ice needs a new manager."

It’s good to see many patriotic citizens in England protesting Robinson’s arrest. Unfortunately, they’ve all been disarmed. Let that reinforce a lesson for us Americans: Never, ever give up your guns. If our government ignores our Constitutional rights and tries to ‘disappear’ us into prison camps, we’ll know what to do. Remember the words of Solzhenitsyn:

“And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?… The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin’s thirst; the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If…if…We didn’t love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation…. We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.”"

The underage sex rings run by Muslims isn't just happening in the UK. It's happening in the U.S. too.,2,75,False,False,False,The_Donald,1527533320.0,True,"&gt;Twin Cities girls, including some who were 13 and younger, were shuffled across state lines to work as prostitutes in a wide-reaching sex-trafficking operation controlled by Somali gangs, according to an indictment unsealed Monday in federal court.

&gt;At a news conference in Nashville Monday morning, U.S. Attorney Jerry Martin announced the 24- count indictment against three women and 26 men. The alleged victims, all minors, were listed as Jane Doe 1 through 4.

&gt;""The indictment alleges that this conspiracy involved other children and victims in addition to Jane Does 1 through 4 over a significant period of time,"" said Martin. ""The indictment sets forth in detail a wide-ranging conspiracy, both in duration and scope, to bring young girls -- some of whom were no more than children -- into this district for the purpose of engaging in sex acts for monetary gains by the defendants.""

&gt;The defendants are listed by name, and nickname: Shorty, Forehead, Hollywood, Barnie.

&gt;The indictment describes how the girls were transported between Minnesota, Tennessee and Ohio, how cell phones were used to recruit customers, and how money, alcohol and drugs were exchanged for sex.


&gt;Three Minneapolis gangs allegedly operated the ring, including an all-female gang known as The Lady Outlaws. Working with the Somali Mafia and the Somali Outlaws, the group recruited pre-teen and teenage girls to have sex in exchange for cash, marijuana and other items, the indictment said.

&gt;The female victims were forced to engage in sex acts in places ranging from a Minneapolis apartment complex to a men's bathroom in a Blaine shopping mall.

https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/11/08/somali-prostitution-ring

The article is from 2010 but what the media won't say is that this is still going on.   The basic model for how it operates is very similar to the UK Pakistani ""grooming gangs"".   We need more resources focused on this sort of thing in Minnesota because the full extent of the problem is being hidden from the public. As in the UK, such investigations are met with denouncements of racism from CAIR and other Islamic groups.  When I asked Somali women about this when the story originally broke, they flat out told me ""these are not good girls"".  They truly think that it's okay to sexually exploit girls if they come from dysfunctional families, act out or do ""bad"" things like smoke marijuana or if she's Somali, refuses to wear hijab.  "

Trump Derangement Syndrome is very real and my friend's wife just blew her stack over nothing.,18,53,False,False,False,The_Donald,1527536665.0,True,"Last time I saw her she said she didn't want to talk to one of her guy friends anymore because he's a Trump supporter. I was like ""so what? why can't you hang out with him. Why would politics even come up?"" And she said, because her husband \-\- my best friend \-\- is an immigrant as though I'm supposed to understand how those two things are connected in her imagination. 

I was confused but didn't pursue the topic. Fyi, he is an immigrant, but not an illegal immigrant. He's been a citizen for over 20 years. She is basically virtue signalling to the entire bar that she married a brown guy at that point. 

Then, today, she showed us this video she saw. In France, there is a baby dangling off a high balcony and a guy climbs up all the floors of the balcony to save the baby. It was pretty amazing. Then she showed us a picture of the guy and he's a black guy, and she said ""See, he's African."" So I said, ""yea wow that's literally awesome."" She said ""France gave him honorary citizenship and offered him a job as a fireman."" I said, ""I can see why. I mean, that's exactly who I would want to rescue me in a fire.""

Then she goes ""If that happened in America, Trump wouldn't have thanked him!"" No one brought up Trump or politics that whole day until she did that. We were having such a fun time. And she kept going on and on \(we're in public by the way at a Memorial Day parade\) with what Trump hypothetically would have done wrong in that situation. No one was even talking back to her but she kept going. Not satisfied until a scene was made.

I was pretty freaked out. The brainwashing is so powerful. she has been told he is racist so many times that she actually believes he is a white supremacist who hates legal immigration and she will relate absolutely anything, no matter how obscure, back to how Trump is a racist. She somehow can't see that that scenario is in her imagination and she was getting more and more wound up and angry the more she went on. 

It was like a computer with corrupted data overheating grinding it's gears, the friction and the pressure building. smoke was practically coming out of her ears. Finally her husband started walking with and talking to her to calm her down. We walked back to their place and she went straight to her room and slammed the door. I just gave my friend a hand shake and said ""do what you gotta do"" and let myself out. 

I thought about texting and apologizing. I know I didn't do anything wrong but honestly I don't care what she thinks of me so I just thought if I could scapegoat myself to help my friend out I would do that. If I apologized and she felt like she won, maybe she would be easier for him to have to be around for the next several hours.
