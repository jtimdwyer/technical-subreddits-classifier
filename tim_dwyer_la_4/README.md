# Project 3: Student or Pupil? Using text posts to determine subject matter expertise
_By Tim Dwyer_

## Problem Statement

In this repository I've explored two basic questions.

1. Q1
2. Q2


## File Structure
```
.
├── README.md
├── data/
└──  notebooks/
```

The `data/` directory is where the `csv` and `json` files are stored after being obtained through the Reddit and Pushshift APIs, as well as the staging ground for files throughout data processing.

The `notebooks/` directory contains a number of jupyter notebooks that detail the data collection, exploration and modeling process.

### Outline
1. [Data collection](./notebooks/1_data_acquisition.ipynb)
    > For the first question I obtained around 10,000 posts on the mainpage of reddit (the `all` listing) by using the official Reddit API. For the second question I sent a request to the Pushshit API  
2. I explored data
    > twice
3. I modeled data
    > twice

4. I answered the question
    > twice
