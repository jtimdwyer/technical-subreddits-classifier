       "\"This is something that's always bugged me since I read [Who can name the bigger number?](https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html). Specifically this paragraph:\\n\\n>One way to understand this is that even small Turing machines can encode profound mathematical problems. Take Goldbach’s conjecture, that every even number 4 or higher is a sum of two prime numbers: 10=7+3, 18=13+5. The conjecture has resisted proof since 1742. Yet we could design a Turing machine with, oh, let’s say 100 rules, that tests each even number to see whether it’s a sum of two primes, and halts when and if it finds a counterexample to the conjecture. Then knowing BB(100), we could in principle run this machine for BB(100) steps, decide whether it halts, and thereby resolve Goldbach’s conjecture.\\n\\nSo the whole point is that the machine will halt if it finds a counter-example. But if it runs for more than BB(100) steps, it will never halt, and thus never find a counter-example. The thing is, BB(100) is a gigantic number, but it's still finite. If the machine is just checking numbers one after the other, it will have checked only a finite amount after BB(100) steps. So doesn't that imply that there is a maximum integer N such that if Goldbach holds for all integers less than N, it holds for all integers greater than N as well? That can't be right.\""
