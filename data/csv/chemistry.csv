I'm a chemistry undergrad (Pharmaceuticals) in my 2nd year at University. Now my course is only 20 something people, and I'm the only one with visible tattoos. I'm beginning to wonder are tattoos shunned on in this field, or science in general.

I plan to have two full sleeves done in the next year or two, but I'm worrying that I'm hurting my chances when I go job hunting in the future.

My question is should I reconsider getting more? Or am I generally gonna be okay? Maybe I'm just overthinking it.

"Requesting your advice! Regarding experiences from when you took introductory organic chemistry, and from current/past organic chemistry instructors.",8,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1483477708,True,"Hi, there.

For the past few semesters, I've been doing weekly tutorials for introductory organic chemistry.  I try to spend most of my time:

* discussing things that are frequently ignored or skimped (e.g., what the different arrows mean and how to use each one properly);
* practicing mechanisms;
* tips and tricks;
* answering questions that students have.

For every 150 minutes per week of class, there's 50 minutes of this optional tutorial / supplemental instruction time.  As it is optional, it's mostly considered to be time studying.

**To the (past and present) instructors of introductory organic chemistry:**  Is there anything in particular that you'd like students to have extra practice with?  Anything in particular that tutors teach that you'd like to *not* have taught (e.g., acronyms for tricks, getting too far ahead, etc.)?

**To the instructors of later organic chemistry courses:**  Is there anything is particular that you feel that students are lacking when they arrive in your classes that I should spend extra time on?  Having marked final exams for introductory organic chemistry, I have seen a variety of mistakes that should never have continued past the first week of class, but there might be more advanced topics that should be developed more.

**To past students of organic chemistry:**  What would have made you understand the content better?  Certain teaching styles?  More examples?  Alternative explanations from what is given by the textbook or instructor?  More visualisation/models?  I'm also a computational chemistry student, so I can make animations if helpful.

I'm also open to any other comments that you may have.  If you have any advice on reaching students that are typically left behind (e.g., organic chemistry is typically more successful for visual learners, leaving auditory or tactile learners behind), I'd be eager to read your suggestions on reaching these students.

Thank you very much!"

Now you have a mixture of the Sodium bicarb and Monosodium Tartrate.  
  
I found that in ethanol, sodium bicarb is insoluble, but I cannot find any data on Tartrate (even wikipedia only has a few lines on it), but I know like dissolves like (in smaller carbon chains), and in water both Tart and Bicarb dissolve which would lead me to conclude that in ethanol if Bicarb is insoluble then Tart would be insoluble as well.

I had it made. My freshman year of college, I got an internship at a Fortune 500 in R&D that I absolutely loved. But I'm an idiot. Seriously really dumb. And I decided to apply (and got into) chemical engineering, declined my position to go back to my chemistry internship, and tried to find an internship in engineering. And failed. And hated engineering. And switched back to chemistry. 

Now, although my old boss says there's still a chance I could go back, I won't know until April. And I might not be able to. And I only have a 3.0 (because I didn't do well in my engineering classes). What am I supposed to do? I'm probably not going to have an internship this summer. Not only that, but I threw away the best opportunity of my life. There is no way to measure how much I hate myself right now. How do you move forward from this? What *can* I do this summer? I've never felt worse about myself and I guess I just need some reassurance that my chances in chemistry are still okay and that I don't have to run back to engineering (which I hate). "

New to job searching,3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1483661857,True,"Hey everyone,

I will be finishing my phd in an inorganic lab this year and have started searching for jobs. My main project has been concerned with the synthesis of electrolytes for multi valent ion batteries. I also sort of had a joint appointment between two professors during my time here. Not only did I work in a chemistry lab, but in an MSE lab as well. There I did a lot of characterization of the electrolytes I made as well as cell fabrication, testing, materials characterization, and materials synthesis. I'm familiar with both labs pretty equally, with maybe a little more emphasis on the chemistry lab. Again, my formal degree will be in chemistry.

First of all, what are the best sources to find a job out of grad school? I've looked at job sites, and I've heard of people having success by simply networking at conferences. I think my professor may have some connections that I could exploit as well.

Now that I've just started job searching, I am having an identity crisis. How do I market myself? Am I an inorganic chemist? A materials chemist? Materials scientist? Electrochemist (that's what the engineers call themselves)? I know my experience may be sort of unique having two PIs. Has anyone been in a similar situation that can offer some insight?

In a benzene reaction why does the catalyst form a bond and then break the bond??,3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1483768597,True,"A Level student here, when and electrophile attacks a benzene with a catalyst, the catalyst is formed back. For example the, when Br molecule is made into an electrophile, the Br molecule forms a dative covalent bond with iron (III) bromide by donating a lone pair of electrons from one bromine atom. This draws the electrons from the other bromine atom in the Br molecule making it partially positive creating an electrophile. 

So the iron (III) bromide which is the catalyst accepts a lone pair of electron to form FeBr4 -. 
Then it releases the Br- to form back the catalyst which is iron (III) bromide. 

My question is why does the catalyst forms a dative bond with a Br atom and then releases it again?  what makes it form a bond and then break the bond?? My lecturer said it's because it's a catalyst and it has to form back. But Im not really satisfied with that answer. "

[Question]Ideas needed. What the heck happened to my product on the prep TLC plate?,11,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1483783186,True,"Hello fellow chemists! I am trying to separate an alkyl diphosphine dioxide from a mixture using prep TLC, and I am having a problem making sense of my data.

The reaction goes from the alkyl diphosphine to the corresponding oxide by air oxidation. I have taken a 31P NMR spectrum of the crude mixture where I found the major peak at 50.2 ppm that may correspond to the desired compound. There were some impurities (~59 ppm, ~30ppm, probably oxygen insertion products) so I decided to try prep TLC (eluent = 1:9 MeOH/DCM) to isolate the compound. I seem to have found the compound in one fraction (based on proton NMR), but the phosphorous shift of this fraction is at 57.5 ppm, which is alarmingly close to one of my impurities at ~58 ppm. 

Since all these compounds are white solid and are not active under UV light, I had to use I2 to stain my plate to figure out where the bands are. I don't think I2 would do anything to my product so I carried on anyway. I have been using an external standard (85% phosphoric acid in another NMR tube) and it has been working well for me, though I know that this method could cause signals to shift a few ppms on the spectrum. I am also suspecting that methanol may have interacted with my phosphine. Can there be any other possibilities?

TL;DR: what I seems to be my product has a ~7 ppm downfield shift after prep TLC. Need some ideas to explain what may have happened."

During my initial months working with the company for my Microbiology Co-op term I was told this compound is 100% safe, non-reactive, biologically and chemically inert. I did quite a bit of research over my time there and eventually saw a gap in the research data- no mutagenicity testing and no actual scientific papers to confirm these claims. Not to mention that this compound breaks down when exposed to water so it is definitely not 100% inert and poses a threat as an environmental toxin. 

We import this product from China where regulations are known to be lax, and I have seen first hand colour variations in different batches which shows a lack of quality control and protocol in the manufacturing of this compound. 

I want to get the Ames test performed and am attempting to invoke the ""precautionary principle"" at my place of work to get this testing done. With ICP analysis and an Ames test we could quickly determine 1. the purity of commercially available powder and potential contaminants and 2. if exposure causes an increase in the rate of mutation.

I would really appreciate some feedback on this. I do not want to upset my boss (owner of this 'small-business'), put this companies bottom line at risk or cause any problems in the workplace, but I am genuinely concerned about the safety of this material and the potential acute and chronic effects of exposure. I have brought up testing in my place of work and have been brushed off every time I bring up these concerns. I have customers asking me specifically if the products we sell are safe and its getting harder and harder to toe the company line, so I am reaching out for advice - any help from a legal, chemical, environmental, regulatory, and professional perspective is much appreciated.

Some pointed questions:
- what is the process for getting a chemical compound approved for commercial sale?
- are the compounds that are approved for sale ever re-tested for purity and adherence to commercial standards?
- what are the 'flags' for compounds and commercial goods that are required to go through mutagenicity testing? who pays for this testing?
- what safety documentation is required from the manufacturer?
- what documentation is required to be provided to the consumer?
- any other help regarding legalities in question, chemical analysis of compound and manufacturing process, and related advice greatly appreciated.

Would a degree in Chem or ChemE prepare me more for a PhD in Materials/Molecular Engineering?,10,9,False,False,False,chemistry,1483872653,True,"Let me begin by summarizing my current situation:

I'm a first year student at my university's chemical engineering program and have yet to really delve into chemical engineering so switching majors right now wouldn't set me back at all.

I intend/hope to go to graduate school regardless of whether I major in chemistry or chemE.  However, my main interests include materials engineering, molecular engineering, those new molecular machines, polymer synthesis, quantum chemistry, nanotechnology (maybe just a trend?) and similar areas.  I'm aware that molecular and materials engineering are very interdisciplinary especially at the graduate level (and I would probably do fine with either a chemistry or chemE degree) but would a degree in chemistry or chemE prepare me for the topics I listed above as well as getting into a decent graduate program? I'm aiming high for the University of Chicago or Washington since they have some of the only ""molecular engineering"" graduate programs in the country right now.

I've been told to try and keep a title of ""engineer"" for job security, granted, I have no idea what the job market is for ""molecular engineers"" at the moment sense it is a very new degree program.

I'm considering switching from a chemical engineering to chemistry undergraduate degree because chemistry offers a more in-depth education in physical, analytical, and quantum chemistry (which seem important to materials and molecular engineering) as well as polymer synthesis and synthesis in-general.  Synthesis, I hear, chemical engineers are notoriously bad at, but that's just what I hear.  My chemical engineering program offers few opportunities to study synthesis except an advanced class in polymers though the chemistry program offers a similar class as well, and I don't have much interest in the reactor design, controls, etc... aspects of chemical engineering.

I can easily add a differential equations class (the highest math class undergraduate engineers take at my university) to a chemistry program since it has a bit more free space than the chemical engineering program.  However, my only dilemma is the ""engineering"" bit of chemical engineering.  The university of Chicago offers a bachelors in molecular engineering which seems to involve mostly materials related classes though it also involves transport phenomenon which is not a class I would be able to take   in a chemistry program?

TL;DR
For a graduate degree in materials/molecular engineering should I start with a bachelors in chemical engineering and sacrifice in depth study of physical chemistry and synthesis?  Or take a chemistry degree (+ a little bit of extra math) and sacrifice transport phenomenon and advanced engineering design which, according to uchicago, is important for molecular engineers?

Also, from what I hear, maintaining a higher gpa in chemistry might be easier, which would be great for grad school applications, considering how notoriously difficult chemE is.  Though I have no doubt chemistry is difficult as well.

I'm a PhD Level chemist, about 6 months post PhD in the UK. I am currently earning £28K in a very small company which I am hoping to negotiate to £35K. I am also eyeing two Post-Doc positions in Imperial College London which pay £36K minimum. 

From the RSC's Pay and Rewards survey chemists in the 25-29 age range are paid between £25-35K.

However, my partner, who is German, tells me that salaries in the chemical industry must be much higher in Germany, although I don't have any evidence for this anecdotal or otherwise, but I assume it might be true.

So, if you are from the UK, Germany, or other places in Europe? How much are you paid? Is it enough? Are you under or over-valued? What is the average chemists salary where you are?

Dopant naming convention? Help!,5,9,False,False,False,chemistry,1483894534,True,"What's the proper way of writing a material name that includes a dopant? I've been googling it but can't seem to find a the naming convention described anywhere.

The procedures in my placement lab required the use of molecular bromine - at least half a litre at any one time, often more. This was the first time I had worked with the reagent, and I've done the synthesis a hundred times since, but the sight of those thick orange fumes billowing out of a flask still makes me incredibly nervous. Never even had an accident (other than lots of melted tubing, HBr plumes and a heavily corroded/broken Phoenix valve), but it's by far the 'scariest' reagent I've worked with. Spring-loaded spray bottles of thiosulfate solution all round!

Question about polymerizing n-vinylpyrrolidone to poly(vinylpyrrolidone),6,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1484002107,True,"So first, if there is a more appropriate sub, I will happily submit it there, but this was my first thought.

I'm a chemical engineering grad student and not an organic chemist, which is why I need a little input.

I have been trying to synthesize NVP --> PVP and I'm having trouble. About a year ago I had successfully completed the synthesis and produced a dry white powder before having to focus on a different project. I have returned to this project and I'm having a serious issue. Namely, every iteration ends with a golden color gel, essentially. The general procedure I got from literature that has worked previously is as follows:

1) combine 0.0322g AIBN with 16.194 mL THF
2) Place of N2 and heat to 60C
3) Add 4.262 mL of NVP, stir 24 hours
4) Precipitate with petroleum ether, vacuum filter, dry overnight
5) voila PVP

So I have tried increasing the time to 48 hours, I have tried doing this in only air, I have tried increasing the solvent volume, I have dried the THF with sieves, and I have purchased and used new AIBN. 

Every time the last month or so, I end up with a golden color gel that does nothing when I add any nonpolar solvent to it. It will dissolve in water but it tends to give a cloudy white color. PVP dissolved in water typically looks slightly golden. My lab partner performed H-C HSQC NMR and we could not verify there was cross linking occuring. Regular 1H and 13C NMR are a bit muddled but it appears to show mostly PVP, but if THF is trapped within the ""gel"" somehow, it could also cause some of the confusion around where the ring hydrogens would show up. 

So my question is, is there anything glaringly obvious I am missing? Any idea what the hell is happening with the golden gel product and why that is the final form that won't crash out like it has in the past?

I recognize there is little chance of someone knowing, but any input would be greatly appreciated."
Vacuum Pump Question: Cleaning hydrocarbon oil from a PFPE pump,4,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1484003869,True,"Does anyone have experience with PFPE pumps?
I'm accustomed to working with rotary vane vacuum pumps with hydrocarbon oil. A colleague came to me today saying that they have a rotary vane pump that normally needs PFPE oil, but was changed out for hydrocarbon oil by mistake.  The resulting mixed fluid in the pump emulsified - so the mistake was realized and the pump was shut down and drained.  The pump draws on a plasma cleaning device which I'm told has mostly N2 and O2 inside (this kind of instrument is outside my range, so maybe some Nano people know better), so I'm not so worried about reactivity of the oil, which I've seen as a concern on some websites. 

1. Does it seem reasonable to flush the pump with PFPE and fire it back up?
2. Is there a preferred cleaning method/solvent that people have used and like?

Any other thoughts are most welcome.

[Suggestion] Named Reaction of the Day,20,27,False,False,False,chemistry,1484061398,True,"Hey /r/chemistry,

I love the synthesis problems, but I find a lot of them very difficult. I would think a good deal of this community feels the same way. I know there are some great books for named reactions, and the whole idea of just focusing on one reaction can be boring at times, but I feel like it would be a great tool for a lot of students/professionals to just think about 1 named reaction/weekday. And I'd love to hear input about people who have done the reaction, or how familiar people are who have used it, or if it's not really used, or what reagents are prohibitively expensive/dangerous. 

I feel like I'll study a reaction for a half hour, fully understand it, but never use it and then a month later I've forgotten the reagents and mechanism. I think focusing on it, or remembering a user's story of how they used it/how they remember it would help me think and understand it more, in addition to making a post about it.


The new literature reactions are critical, and I would love to see more synthesis problems as well, so I don't want to stop there, but I think focusing on the stepping stones may help a large portion of this community. 

Thoughts? Comments? Have we done something like this before? Is this more of a /r/chemhelp type of thing?

"Pharmacognosy: Patented ""GoPO"" galactolipid compound vs generic 4:1 rose hip extract for osteoarthritis?",2,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1484063858,True,"Hi guys. I was wondering if you could help me with this question. 

So, here's some background: Rose hips are considered to have moderate-strong evidence based on a systematic review of the use of 5g of a brand called Litozin (GoPO) for reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis. 

There were two major double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs done on Litozin, both using around 100 patients (approx 50/50 split male/female), and both with a Jadad score of 5/5, which indicates high study quality. 

[(Source)](http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2012/july/rosehip/)

However, according to researchers on Litozin, systematic reviews of rose hips have been negatively monographed by the German Commission E (a database for herbal products' efficacy) up until the point of the publication of the Litozin studies. [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18384191)

So, my question is this: what is in this ""GoPO"" extract and is it possible to get the constituents from generic rose hips in a high-enough dosage?

Thanks very much.

Also, [here](https://www.google.com/patents/US20110135721) is the patent page for ""GoPO"", but I don't know enough chemistry to be able to decipher it.

/r/chemistry's Biweekly Named Reaction Suggestions,15,18,False,False,False,chemistry,1484164826,True,"Hi guys, this is based on /u/Scott55e's great idea that we feature named or otherwise interesting and important reactions on a regular basis. (Thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/5n5k29/suggestion_named_reaction_of_the_day/))

Based on our discussions there, I was thinking of doing these twice per week, and since we have a stickied discussion thread on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, these could be posted on Thursday and Sunday. The main purpose of this thread will be to get **suggestions** on reactions to feature from you all. Please comment with your suggestions! Though many of you probably know which one(s) you'd like to contribute to, no need to commit to writing anything now. There will be another thread for that once we get a nice batch of suggestions. We'll **make a schedule for these based on which ones get the most upvotes here**, so vote for your favorites.

I have one important question that I'd like your input on: *Who* should post the threads? The way I see it, more than one person can and should contribute to each thread, especially to the more well-known and older reactions like Diels-Alder. There are several options in my mind:

1. All the contributors work out one person to post the thread and all send their contributions as a text file to this person, who makes the post on the allotted day. A mod stickies the post for the day.
2. All the contributors send me, or some other designated poster, their contributions and the designated poster compiles them and posts them. A mod stickies the post for the day.
3. I or another designated poster simply makes a post with the name and maybe brief scheme/description of the reaction, and all contributions go in the comments, hopefully with the best being upvoted to the top. This is the most ""democratic"" method, and it removes the need for specific people to sign up for a reaction. It simplifies the process, but I could see a risk of someone's good, thought-out contribution not reaching the top because people don't upvote it, which defeats the purpose of featuring knowledgeable people's experiences and perspectives.
4. Some other option that I didn't think of. Let's discuss.

There may be ways to automate this process with AutoModerator as well. /u/mitchandre might be able to help with that.

So suggest reactions and discuss how we want to do this! Thanks!

Why is there styrene in my toluene-D8?,7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1484263467,True,"I ran a toluene-d8/MeOH standard using SPME for GC-MS. This TD-8 bottle (we'll call it TD-8 bottle #1) had been open for quite some time, and frequently used when preparing internal standards (where there are larger possibilities of contamination). Although the styrene abundance was low, it was still able to mess up my blank integrations for some instrumental calibrations I'm working on. Here is my thought process and order in which I tried to solve this problem:

1. Got a brand new 4 L jar of MeOH. Prepared a new TD-8/MeOH solution (using TD-8 bottle #1). Still saw styrene. 

2. Looked at an empty vial blank I ran the other day. No styrene. (I did this to see whether the fiber had styrene, which it appeared that it didn't) 

3. Found a sealed ampoule of TD-8 (TD-8 bottle #2, it's 30 years old, but stored away from light and heat) and ran it. Saw about the same abundance of styrene as seen in the TD-8 bottle #1. Still small amounts, but increase our styrene detection limit calculations by about 8 ppm (when our detection limits are usually <0.5 ppm for SPME) 

My thought from here was that possibly some reaction goes on with toluene and something else present (then again I'm in analytical and we like to pretend we know organic chemistry). The sealed ampoule didn't have any indication that it was spiked with TMS, just that it was 9x.x%deuterium. 

I'm thinking next, I'm going to try running a new empty vial, since the previous one I looked at was from earlier in the week. Im thinking that after that original empty vial, the fiber may have become saturated with styrene. We just changed our fiber about 1.5-2 weeks ago, so it's pretty new. 

Any ideas on next steps, or possible reasons behind this? It usually isn't this big of a deal, but the fact I'm calculating an 8 ppm detection limit for styrene when it's usually 5 ppb can make a big difference! Thanks in advance! "
Anhydrous nitric acid handling,7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1484264228,True,"Hi

Although I work in an alleged chemistry lab I am woefully ignorant when it comes to wet chemistry or handling chemicals relative to many of you. My expertise is more with gas phase experimental design and lasers, and most of the chemicals I handle come in lecture bottles or can be housed in a bubbler without much concern.

I need to photolyze gas-phase nitric acid to make OH soon and literature indicates I'm going to want to use anhydrous (fuming) HONO2. I have read the MSDS, but I still have some questions, and any tips (safety or otherwise) you want to offer are welcome.

First of all, I can buy anhydrous nitric acid from Sigma but I've also seen the following method employed: ""we prepare anhydrous nitric acid by bubbling a stream of nitrogen through a mixture containing three parts sulfuric acid and one part nitric acid and collecting the anhydrous nitric acid, which is entrained in the nitrogen flow."" It's not obvious to me why you would go this route when you can just buy the anhydrous sample and let its vapor pressure do the trick. Is it just not something you want to keep around in lab?

Next, I know it's obviously extremely corrosive to metals--do I even need to worry about stainless steel fittings? Bear in mind only the vapor will come in contact with the fittings.

I also see conflicting reports on the vapor pressure. [Sigma](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigald/84392?lang=en&region=US) has it at 8 mmHg, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0447.html) has it at 48 mmHg. Anyone know why? [This](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/je60043a020) paper seems to suggest the CDC value is correct at 20 °C, but similar experiments have kept the sample at -20 °C, so it's probably more like the Sigma value (even though that's allegedly 20 °C...).

Finally, what do I need to do to degas my sample before letting it equilibrate under vacuum?

I appreciate any feedback"

Just got into Cold Brew Coffee and looking for extraction advice.,10,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1484278311,True,The two methods for cold brew coffee extraction are slow drip through the grounds or immersion of the grounds for ~24hrs. The drip method seems to have the results I would like however I can find very little info on the effect of drip rate and nowhere can I find a setup that allows control of the drop diffusion through the grounds like how long on average a drop is in contact with grounds before dripping etc. Anyways would be fun to experiment with and that means I need precise drip control to start so any simple device that can operate with variable head pressure would be good. Also I have some ideas on how to control the average time each drop is in contact with the grounds but nothing that really sounds solid. Any advice on that step of the extraction would be much appreciated.

Many physicists in the past have tried to reduce the study of chemistry into physics and always failed. Why?,13,24,False,False,False,chemistry,1484330931,True,"I just wanted to say that this is a purely philosophical question that I saw on a history and philosophy of science paper. It obviously doesn't mean that reducing chemistry is physics is wanted or in any way desirable. However I do think it is an interesting question. 

Physics tends to study fundamental processes including the study of matter and energy and I guess in many ways chemistry can be considered the study of certain fundamental aspects of the physical world. And yet chemistry as subject, despite the great overlap with physics, is still methodologically distinct from physics; indeed similar phenomena are studied in different ways in chemistry and physics. It seems as if the study of chemistry operates on a different level to physics, and it reminded me of a list of quotes from physicists who lamented that they were unable to reduce chemistry into physics.

Why is this the case and what does it mean? I know there is a lot of overlap in physical chemistry and chemical physics and quantum molecular mechanics, and greater focus on computational and theoretical chemistry; does that mean the boundaries between physics and chemistry are becoming increasingly blurred? I know many people roll their eyes at questions like this but I thought it was an interesting one. "

Wedding band toxicity,22,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1484415056,True,"Hello,

My girlfriend and I have recently begun looking at saving up to buy our wedding bands and engagement rings. We've looked at all the standard materials (platinum, gold, titanium, tungsten carbide, silver) and each one has its merit. However, I've always wanted to have a unique material. I've always been intrigued with osmium because it is such a beautiful color and has lots of wonderful properties, but really all of the metals in the platinum family are interesting. I recently settled on iridium as a material because oxides of osmium are horribly toxic. I figure iridium might be a safer alternative.

Does anyone know if osmium metal would create oxides at room temperature, or would it remain stable enough to be basically inert? Would it be safe to wear as a ring every day? And would anyone know anyone who could possibly work with such a difficult metal to forge it into jewelery?

Problems keeping small samples (20ml) at optimal temperature,16,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1484426619,True,"Hi,
maybe some of you like to offer me some advice on the following: I am a media designer and a nerd with a skin condition who tries to develop his own skin-cream. To keep a long story short: I am doing this for about 1 year now and I am still having problems, keeping the optimal temperature for my water phase.

I am working with an emulsifier / thickening agent combo which favors temperatures in the range of 85 to 90 °C. I work with very small batches – 20 ml in total where the water phase is 17,9 ml in my actual formula. I need to get these 17,9 ml to about 85 to 90°C (which I alone find difficult enough) and keep them there.

At the moment I try to get both water and fat phase to about 85°C, mix both and homogenize. That means, that the necessary temperature is only for a second in the perfect range.

What I want to try now is, to hold that temperature for a minute while homogenizing, to reduce droplet size and achieve higher stability of my emulsion – hope that even makes sense...

I am using 100 ml [beakers](http://www.ivohaas.at/i/becherglaeser-duran-hohe-form~p~5~5324.jpg), a bunsenburner and an induction cooking plate with an old pot from my grandma... yes very professional... 

Are there any, thermally slower, steal beakers or something? How do you keep stuff at optimal temperature levels?

I was nervous about taking the class, because I was worried I was going to get chemicals on others/myself. Since it's been so long, I can't remember what we did in the class. Since I was nervous, I'm afraid I poured something down the sink that wasn't supposed to go there. I know I used a pipette for multiple things without using a new one, which is a no-no.

How can a bond be both single and double?,6,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1484514997,True,"I know that Lewis structures are very limited in showing delocalized electrons, so valence structures take care of that. And I know valence shows that the electrons are spread across the electrons. My question is: how can a double and a single bond exist between two atoms? For example, CO3's valence shows three solid lines and three dotted lines to show that the electrons are spread across the atoms like that. What I don't understand is how all those bonds exist at once? 

I'm really sorry for not making sense, I hope you understand what I'm asking. I know that when orbitals are hybridized a sigma bond forms when two orbitals point at each other, and a pi bond forms when two are parallel. So how can they be both parallel and pointing at each other? Again, I'm only in Orgo I and have taken gen chem, so my education isn't extensive so that's probably the root cause. "
"Older student, organic chemistry... exercise books?",9,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1484515856,True,"Hello everyone,

I'm in my mid-30s, thinking of changing careers to something that requires basic organic chemistry (for plant biology) as part of the core curriculum. I've been tinkering here and there, watching videos and doing Khan Academy to learn the basics from the ground up again. I did basic chem/physics in HS but nothing since then, so I can retain some of the material but new stuff doesn't stick for very long because I have no concrete practice of working through problems. (The quizzes on KA are very short.)

I'm not talking about labs here, and anyways I can't afford formal schooling at the moment (which is why I'm all 100% self-study). I can do books with some planning, but not classes.

I need something more structured and with more exercises.

Why are the nastiest chemicals usually very small molecules?,13,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1484520132,True,"I just thought about this - most of the nastiest chemicals known (very toxic or explosive) are very small molecules.

Let's take pharmacology for example. In anxiolytics that act on the GABA receptor as positive modulators, we have ethanol (small molecule - ethyl hydroxide) and benzodiazepines (large molecules). Both increase GABA neurotransmission, but ethanol is much more dirty. Ethanol also causes significant damage to the heart and liver with chronic use, toxicities that have nothing do with its effects on GABA. Benzodiazepines don't cause these issues, and are ""cleaner"".

Another example is formaldehyde. It's a tiny molecule - CH2O, only 4 atoms, and it is a very nasty molecule. It is corrosive and it causes severe nerve damage to humans, even with small exposure.

How come almost all these nasty molecules are very small? How can formaldehyde be so corrosive and toxic if it is so small and contains only oxygen, 2 hydrogens and one carbon? None of these atoms are nearly as toxic as formaldehyde in a free form, but when you put them like this it's very dangerous.

I'm sorry if it's a basic question, but it seems like it should be just the opposite. Very small molecules like formaldehyde shouldn't be dangerous at all because they made of atoms that are found everywhere and should be easy to dismantle by the body due to their basic structure, yet they cause severe damage. The bigger molecules tend to be the safer, cleaner ones.

How come?"

What is the interaction of photons of frequency of more than enough energy to promote an electron to a higher orbital level in an aotm,3,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1484540345,True,"Haven't done chemistry in a very long time and now taking a chemistry course. As I was reviewing, I started to wonder, what is the interaction of photons being fired at an atom if the photon has an amount of energy that is more than enough to promote an electron to a higher orbital level, but not enough to go two levels above. Eg), more than enough to go from n=1 to n=2, but not quite enough to get to n=3. Is some energy ""taken"" from the photon to promote the electron and a new photon of lower frequency formed? Or is there no effect at all and the photon just passes through the atom with no relevant interaction. I feel like the latter is more in tune with the idea of quanta and discrete levels.

Secondly, then how do atomic spectra work in regard with the electric discharge. From what I know about electricity, it is not quantized like photons, so when an electric discharge is passed through a gas, do the atoms absorb a certain amount of energy from the electricity, causing the electrons to promote, and letting the rest pass through?

Thanks for quelling my curiosity.

2 questions regarding acids and pH,3,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1484578905,True,"Hi everybody. I have 2 questions regarding acids and pH. I don't have chemistry on a high level yet (Compared to USA, I guess it would be the last years of High School), but still find it quite hard to find answers to my questions online. Also pardon my English - I'm from Denmark :).

1) If you mix hydrochloric acid with water, you get an exoterm reaction (as far as I'm aware. This might be where I get confused?). But I'm quite confused about what is causing the reaction (read: temperature rise). I do know that HCl (aq) + H2O (l) -> H3O^+ + Cl^-. But since hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, there isn't any actual HCl in the acid - only H3O^+ and Cl^-. Shouldn't it then be Cl^- + H3O^+ + H2O? But what is then causing the temperature rise?

2) Since you measure the pH by looking at the concentration of H3O^+ ions in the liquid, is it then possible to measure pH of a pure substance? Let's say we some pure acetic acid (in this case we say that it hasn't absorbed any water - not a single water molecule). Would it be possible to measure the pH of this, since it hasn't reacted with water (yet). And therefore doesn't have a single H3O^+ ion?

I hope you understood my questions, and would like to help me.
Thank you :)"

What is the crystalline structure of cocaine?,5,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1484614784,True,"As far as I know this post is in compliance with the rules as it's discussing just the crystalline structure of cocaine. Please refrain from any synthesis/extraction discussion. I do not encourage anyone to use, synthesize or extract this compound. As this topic is somewhat taboo I decided to use a throwaway account.

With that disclaimer out of the way I'd like to move on with my question.

Recently a friend of mine showed me what they described as ""very pure cocaine hydrochloride"" (the high purity part is almost certainly correct but I'm not sure about hydrochloride). What surprised me was the crystalline structure. Very seldom have a similar looking compound.

It is sometimes described as ""fishscale"" which does seem like an accurate description. The [best image I was able to find](https://erowid.org/chemicals/cocaine/images/archive/cocaine__i2010e0189_disp.jpg) does not really do it justice. It really is very pretty looking and were it not a scheduled, very expensive chemical I would definitely get my self a sample for my collection of neat chemicals.

I have tried searching the web but found no results on what the the crystalline structure actually is. Or if there is an explanation of why does it have this flaky perlescent appearance. What is this type of perlescent shiny appearance caused by and why does cocaine in particular exhibit this property. I'm assuming it has a thin layered structure reminiscent of graphite. But of course since it's organic it has to be bound together completely differently .

Interestingly, the only time I have seen this appearance before was years ago when I nitrated a little erythritol to erythritol tetranitrate which had a very similar look. But besides being organic there is no similarity in structure of the two compounds.

So does this structure have a name? Why does it happen and why is it so rare?"

In my research group, we've run into issues in the past where a compound was synthesized by one group member or another, but never reported. Months later, the same thing was remade by another person, resulting in lost time due to poor group communication. 

Because of this, my PI now wants me to create some sort of searchable database so that we can search all of the structures that our group has crystallographic data on. I spoke with our in-house crystallographer, who said the only way he would know to do this is to make something in excel/access using just the unit cell parameters, but that wouldn't be very helpful in terms of looking up specific substructures.

I know that you're able to submit structures to the CCDC prior to publishing any actual structures, but I'm hesitant to do this in case we end up producing any manuscripts from these down the road. Essentially what I'm looking for is something similar to the CCDC's search functions, but using a private database.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Why is the surface energy term in nucleation theory always positive?,2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1484690818,True,"In homogeneous nucleation theory, a barrier to nucleation arises from consideration of a surface energy term associated with the new liquid-solid interface.  

This surface energy is always taken to be positive, based on the idea that it requires work to separate a block of material into two new surfaces.  I accept that this idea of surface energy must always be positive i.e. the chemical potential of a component at the surface of a material is higher than in the bulk of that same material.

However, regarding nucleation, the relevant surface energy term is not the chemical potential of a component at the surface of a material relative to the bulk of that same material.  Rather, it is the chemical potential of a component in a liquid relative to the surface of the solid.

So why is the chemical potential of a component at the solid surface always higher than in the liquid?  Even though a component might have a higher chemical potential at the solid surface compared to the solid bulk, couldn't it have a lower potential relative to the liquid, and therefore there would be no barrier to nucleation?"

Anyone has a good scalable synthesis for trifluoracetaldehyde monohydrate from ethyl trifluoroacetate?,6,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1484702373,True,"Hi everyone!

I will need a larger amount (up to kg) of fluoral hydrate (trifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate) for a future project, however we only have trifluoroacetic acid to start with. After looking up the scientific literature after this, I only found two reasonable methods, on is the reduction with LiAlH4, and the other one goes with NaBH4. Non of them are problem, however the LiAlH4 method deals with a lot ether, so it would be horrible on +10l scale... 

The reduction with NaBH4 in THF/Water is described here: https://www.google.com/patents/US5248832 and it works. 

However, I found a few sentence about a better method in a book (over here, behind paywall: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080434056500335).

*....Since the Widnes fluoral plant was no longer available, however, a 'short-term' synthesis of fluoral hydrate was developed which involved the reduction of ethyl trifluoroacetate with aqueous sodium borohydride. Because this reduction is performed in an aqueous medium, the fluoral immediately forms the stable hydrate, thus preventing over-reduction to trifluoroethanol.
This process does not require any special plant and has been successfully operated on the 100 kg scale. *

Ths method would be the best, however I have found no citation and no reference from this in the literature. Is here anyone who have seen a reference about this, or someone has any good idea where to look after this process?

Help with (?) quaternary ammonium compound formation,4,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1484736263,True,"Hi everyone,

I'm not a chemist so please excuse any clumsy terminology or outright conceptual misunderstandings.

I'm working on biotransformations which involve incubating microbial cultures with [noscapine](http://i.imgsafe.org/f45f5a72f0.png).  I use LC-MS/MS to analyse the samples for noscapine and other metabolites.

I tried a new sample processing method for my last batch and the analysis seems to show that I have lost almost all of the noscapine in most of my samples (including controls, so this isn't a result of the microbial activity).

I ran a few samples through an Orbitrap MS today and noticed that the vanishing noscapine seems to be replaced by a compound with a mass corresponding to noscapine plus a methyl group.

The most likely site for methylation (I think) is the nitrogen, producing a [quaternary ammonium compound](http://i.imgsafe.org/f464772775.png).  But I'm not really sure if this is possible as the published syntheses for this compound require a methyl halide.

I'll run through what's in there:

The growth media contains chloride salts (NaCl, NH4Cl, CaCl2) as well as phosphate buffer and MgCl2.  Noscapine is present at 500 uM, added in DMSO (final concentration 5%).

Samples were quenched with two volumes of MeOH, spun down to remove cell components, then diluted down to 20% MeOH in 0.1% formic acid.  I tested a sample that wasn't diluted into acid (though it would still be acidic) and there was still some formation of the compound.  No heat has been applied during sample processing.

The samples have been in the freezer (-20C) for over a week, and the noscapine concentration has decreased over time.  Samples that have been at room temperature for a day or two show almost complete loss.

So I'm asking if it's possible to produce a quaternary ammonium salt from noscapine in the presence of inorganic salts, MeOH and acid (and all the other metabolites and crap that spilled from the cells) under mild conditions.

Would greatly appreciate any input!"

Is Salt Dissolving in Water a Chemical Change?,11,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1484777530,True,"Hey guys,

So recently, my chemistry-studying friends and I have gotten into a debate over whether or not dissolving salt in water is a physical or chemical change.

Relying on their chemistry background in high school, almost all of my friends say that it's a physical change without hesitation. Here is their reasoning: The water can be extracted from the solution through evaporation (boiling) which yields table salt in the same form it once was. (NaCl) Because water and salt can be combined and separated via exclusively physical means, it is not a chemical reaction. Furthermore, table salt still exists as NaCl while in the water.

However, I'm almost sure that salt dissolving in water is a chemical change, known as dissociation. The table salt compound (NaCl) breaks down into its ionized base elements (Na^+ + Cl^- ) in the presents of H2O. The hydrogen ends attract the chlorine ions, and the oxygen ends attract the sodium ions. Because the compound table salt (NaCl) has been broken down into its base elements in an aqueous solution via dissociation, it is a chemical change.

**TL;DR:** Dissolving (dissociating) salt in water to form an aqueous solution looks like this:

H2O (l) + NaCl (s) > H2O (aq) + Na^+ (aq) + Cl^- (aq)

This is known as dissociation, and is a chemical change. Therefore, dissolving water in salt results in a chemical change. Is any of this/all of TL;DR incorrect? "

But our university is free and it has no real entry exams so sometimes some really inexperienced people get to participate in said lab. 

One day we had to recrystallize some copper sulfate in hot water. Nothing too exciting but it was still a challenge since most have never done anything like this before. 

Everything was going nicely, except one student who had a really hard time getting the CuSO4 to dissolve at all. Our professor told him to heat it more and add some extra water. But the salt still refused to dissolve, so the student turned the hotplate on max and went to the professor to complain. When they returned his beaker was burning with a flame probably 2m tall and rising.

Turns out that student used Acetone instead of water because he didn't pay attention and assumed the canister by the sink was distilled water. 

I know most of you won't believe me, but that wasn't me. I know the difference between Water and Acetone.

Industrial Training Year,1,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1484848850,True,"Evening all, 

I'm currently an undergraduate studying Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry at a Russel Group university. Since September I've being applying for various placement schemes in the country, and even a few in foreign countries but with very little response. The furthest I managed go get was two video interviews one for a Pharmeceutical regulatory affiars posistion at GE and the other for a Drug Safety posistion and Johnson and Johnson. I realise my interview for J&J was terrible so I don't expect to hear back from them but hope there is a chance GE will get back to me.

As well as applying for larger companies like the ones above I've also emailed or otherwise tried to contact in excess of 100 smaller companies, using websites such as Linkedin to find out what they do, whether getting a placement there would be a suitable option or not, etc.

It's at this point that I'm getting slightly worried because soon I'll have to give up looking, in order to sort out my accommodation for next year. However getting onto placement program or even just doing one for a smaller company would be a massive bonus for my CV. 

So, I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on how they got their placements, or if anyone could give me some advice for my current situation?"

Accidental mess. Electrolysis without much thought. Advise wanted.,7,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1484925103,True,"So, I was messing around with a couple of 9V batteries, I'm not sure how much charge was left in them.

I cut up a no 2. pencil that didn't have an eraser and extracted the lead. Putting it on one or both batteries via alligator clips did what you'd expect: made it very hot and started releasing CO2 from burning graphite.

I later split it in half and used each side to start electrolyzing a small glass bowl of water.

Without much though (it felt more like a kitchen experiment than ""real chemistry,"" I decided to try electrolysis in vegetable oil, salt water, and both mixed together. (All water involved was tap water.)

So if you are thinking about the precise chemistry involved, you may already know why electrolysis in salt water isn't the best idea for an experiment without putting any thought into it. Unfortunately, I didn't put any thought into it. My thought process was more like ""you can eat salt. You can drink water. You can apply electricity to either with no complexities. Why not put electricity in salt water!

So yeah. The solution is almost definitely a dilute solution of NaOH, with nice, friendly, Cl2 gas in my kitchen. Fortunately, the batteries didn't produce a whole lot of gas, as one would expect. Also fortunately I had the sense, upon adding salt, to mentally blacklist any Ammonia-related ions from being used.

However, this is all complicated by the fact that the vegetable oil was added. Vegetable oil is an extremely poor conductor and is essentially a non-polar lipid.

I ended up putting the whole container in a plastic bag and removing the 9V batteries from the equation. The question, A, is how to deal with the Lye that's now in the water, and B, what did the electrolysis do to the vegetable oil? Of note, the liquid is not at all clear. It is full of brownish grime that formed with the bubbles. I think that is some kind of organic compound resulting from an interaction between dissolved Lye and vegetable oil. The liquid itself seems more like soap, so I suppose I may have also produced NaClO or something. The brownish stuff could be an iodine compound from interaction with additives to the salt, or rust from the metal alligator clips that were at some points partially submerged, or it could be something resulting from the vegetable oil interacting with caustic stew under electrolysis.

Alright, clearly, I've learned I need to not do chemistry without thinking about the results.

The real question though is what is this stuff and what do I do with it? In particular, how do I safely and ethically dispose of it?

EDIT: neutralized with vinegar. The solution changed color back to a light orange color and then I poured it. Everything seems to have gone fine."

Advice on Professor attempting to screw me out of a patent.,27,55,False,False,False,chemistry,1484939872,True,"So I am a 4 year, nearly done with it all, postdoc chemist working in chemical engineering dept.

I have been working on a project where I, along with an industrial partner, was trying to synthesize a polymer for gelling a special solvent. The industrial partner was using a proprietary synthetic procedure, which ended up being useless for making pure polymers of sufficiency mass and quality. So they backed out half way through the project of doing anything once it became clear we couldn't use anything they made...

I the became the only person designing and synthesizing Polymer for this project. I managed to make some very promising polymers, and we did get some mild viscosity increases but nothing incredible, or worth patenting. However it turns out that one of the plain homopolymers of our monomers of interest would be a good sealant for some special substrates. (Industry partner could not make this.) Information we learned incidentally when presenting the performance data of these polymers to a few other researchers/engineers. It will be a good solid patent and will definitely pay out substantial money over its lifetime. The project ended 8 months ago and people testing my polymers have used up all of the samples I made. My professor asks me to make more as a favour, I do. I also made an improved version as well, because I had spare monomer and had to use inert glove box so why not whilst I was in there get another one set up? This was a month ago. The second one I set up and reacted, at the time was misplaced by a PhD student, who moronically stored it in a cupboard on a cork ring. And I forgot about it until today. I handed over the main batch my old prof wanted, and did a few tests etc.

So I was casually talking to this professor about patenting this today, after he said many people were raving about it and he is very close to securing decent funding from this innovation. Well, he kind of sheepishly said ""I don't think you'll be on the patent"", since the idea to use the polymer as a sealant was not my idea (Not even his either). At the time I knew I couldn't process this properly, and could feel myself going red, And I had to go back to another reaction. So I said ok, we can talk later about this, and left.

Now I went back to my current lab and almost ransacked it, and found the other polymer I made. Well I spent all day testing it, and am fairly sure it will be a straight up better sealant, after all I wasn't designing sealants when I made the original polymers. With this second polymer I decided I'd throw in some other monomers to make a new copolymer, which testing myself with the mettrics we've developed, I can clearly see is going to be a superior sealant to the one everyone else is excited about. My Chem E professor who is thinking of outing me from this patent has no idea about it, and will never think to include it in the patent, he is synthetically useless. I'm fairly sure the other engineers also will overlook this inclusion as well. Do I just say ok go ahead and patent that, doesn't bother me (and later patent this on my own or in industry) or do I try and force my way in with the fact that really I should be on it given the work I've done and the fact I have designed a better sealant for the same purpose?

I have not been forced, as is the excellent stupidity and cheapness of universities, to sign any intellectual property documents, basically meaning I have NOT given away any of my rights but also meaning I don't have recourse in situations like this. The dilemma of having postdocs on the cheap who aren't actually faculty. I also have no need for this professor as a reference given that I'm on a new project, and have loads of other people I can use. 

Should I blow it up or just accept I'm being fucked? It's not even the money, it's being cut out recognition on a patent from a 2 year project I did everything for, which is worth far more to my career now than waiting years for some pay out. To top it all off, the old industrial partner wants some ""so they can do GPC on it for free"" for him. Lol, I suspect they're trying to beat him to it...  

So fucking annoyed right now.

Thoughts?

UPDATE:
I am fairly sure I have a solid claim as an inventor, but decided to do the following.

I am simply going to express my disappointment at being excluded from this patent, and that I really thought given how fortunate we both were for another useful application to be pointed out to us by a third party, we would both be happy to be on joint inventors. Maybe this will give him a nudge to do the right thing. But if not, oh well, yet another reason I'm done with academia and won't be moving onto the full scale project on this sealant stuff later in the year, if it arrives. 

I will keep my idea under my hat until the funded project begins and then drop my idea on them, of course with it being pointed out in almost overbearing fashion that I am to be included on any patents arising from its use for x/y/z."

Ideally, I'd have some tool/machine that I could put the solution in/on, and hit a button to heat it up to a temperature that I select, and keep it there. I imagine you folks have to deal with this sort of thing all the time, so are there any tools out there I might not have considered?

Edit: I appreciate all of your replies. After considering the different ideas, I think the best cost to footprint ratio is a double-boiler system with an infrared thermometer.

"Towards the end of bachelor thesis, prospecting eye to cheminformatics - would appreciate tips",4,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1485103112,True,"Hi folks.

I'm towards the end of my bachelor thesis / honours program in organic radical chemistry. I'm coming to realise that, as much as I have loved organic chemistry, I'm not one for experimental chemistry. I much preferred the conceptual challenge in studying complex mechanisms, and enjoyed the outcome of such studies such as pharmaceutical products. But, now that I'm most of the way through my lab year, I've found I've got less than a natural proclivity for the fine technical labour involved in chemistry. There's nothing I dread more than running a column, or operating HPLC machinery. Give me the spectroscopic characterisation challenge any day, or ask me to design some neighbouring group effects to facilitate a mechanism. That's much more where my interests lie; in the concepts and theory but not in the lab.

I've recently started using Gaussian to model some transition states and intermediates crucial to my project. I've found it to be really fun. I've always had an interest in computers, but never had access as a kid (parents restricted tech time heavily) and found high school compsci subjects slow and boring. In my spare time these days, I've assembled computers, installed parts on laptops, dabbled with codeacademy, and I'm having a phenomenal time and finding thorough joy in writing my thesis in LaTeX.

I'm also looking at broadening my skillset. I am aware of a bunch of comp chem software packages and think they are nifty and can do some useful things. However, I'm hoping to learn some proper computer programming. Rather than just being able to command supercomputers to run gaussian jobs for me to predict very physchem-esque data, I'm thinking it would be cool to learn some broader computer programming. 

I'm entertaining the hypothetical scenario of employment within a pharmaceutical company running bioassays to determine structure activity relationships of pharmacophores from a library of compounds that experimental lab chemists have laboriously made. 

I feel like the skillsets should be broader. A bachelor of science in chemistry could well complement a master of science in computer programming.

It'd be great to hear anything you might have to say. Do you have tips on getting started in compsci as a graduate chemist? Would you go back to study another bachelor, perhaps just a diploma, or keep it self-taught? How should I go about navigating away from the lab bench, and largely, from explicitly compchem software like Gaussian, as a conduit to broader horizons as a computer programmer who can work in biomedical/pharma/biotech/biochemical/chemical industries with an undergraduate in chemistry?

I'd especially love to hear tips from those who work in industry in some kind of capacity! This is because I'm hoping to move away from academia."

I am starting to get acceptance/rejection letters back from graduate schools I applied to. I have my BS in chemistry and a year of research experience in an organic synthesis lab and some less important research experience in spectroscopy/biochemistry. 

What are good questions to ask department chairs? 

What are the pros of cons of working for a professor in the early stage of their career? One of the school's I got accepted to, with an excellent fellowship, has several organic chemists but they're all young. They are publishing regularly/receiving national awards/grants. 

What do you wish you knew about graduate school before you accepted an admission offer?

My formaldehyde detector shows high levels of formaldehyde in my home and for several products (>2 mg/m^3). Possible sensor error?,6,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1485174258,True,"I live in China and recently bought an air purifier to lower the air pollution in my home. I bought a pm2.5 sensor to test the results and the particulate matter sensor seems pretty accurate to what the other sensors in the area report. The same sensor also included a formaldehyde detector, though that was not what I bought it for. 

Home levels of formaldehyde appear to usually be around .3 mg/m^3 which it claims to be a moderate level of formaldehyde contamination.

 My biggest worry is that after putting it near soy sauce and several different brands of open beer it goes off the scale for the detector(>2mg/m^3). I at first suspected that it could actually be formaldehyde in  beer, but I tested 4 different brands of beer and 3 brands of soy sauce. They all go off scale which leads me to doubt the results. Is this a natural aspect of these two things or is my detector possibly a cheap POS that is detecting something else? 

Looking for advice on what could be going on and if I should be worried. Thanks for your time."

Help growing alum crystals?,1,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1485201396,True,"I've been trying to grow crystals in little sculpy shapes, but I've been having a hell of a time getting crystals to actually grow. I bought a pound of alum power (which came in granules, so I don't know if that's part of the issue). For my shapes, I put glue on the inside and covered it with the alum. I didn't want to wait an hour, so I blow dried until it was dry. I mixed 2 cups of water with 3/4 cup of alum powder. I poured it into a bowl and dropped the shape in. Instantly, the alum started separating from the shape settled at the bottom. Eventually it dissolved completely. The only thing I've been able to achieve is a mild spattering of bumps on the sculpy shapes. 

What am I doing wrong? Am I not putting enough alum into the mixture? (One try, I put the almost the same amount of alum with water and wound up with a briny slush) Should I wait for the mixture to cool down so it doesn't disolve all the alum on my base? Should I be using a different glue? Should I be suspending the shapes? I've seen crystals grown on plastic eggs and jar lids, so I don't think sculpy is too unreasonble to grow on.

It turnes out it has distinctly different properties, due to being ""Glycol modified"". Now, as you may or may not know, normal PET is in fact processed with Terephtalic Acid and Ethylenglycol. My question is, how that extra Glycol modification comes into play. Wikipedia lists it under Copolymers, so is it polymerized with another glycol, other than EtGlyc? Just an excess of Glycol, that is then incorporated between or even in the chains?

Without further ado,
### [The Diels Alder Cycloaddition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diels%E2%80%93Alder_reaction)
Named after Otto Diels and Kurt Alder, who correctly elucidated the structure of the products in 1928, the Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a 1,3-diene and a dieneophile, generally an alkene. The net result is the formation of two new sigma bonds and the breakage of one pi bond (two pi bonds broken, one formed), creating a new six-membered ring. The synthetic value is huge, and there has been a tremendous amount of investigation of the kinetics and stereoelectronics of the reaction; the products' stereochemistry can usually be predicted based on the geometry of the starting alkene and diene. There are many excellent reviews on the DA reaction, many of which can be found on the Wikipedia References section.

I'm really happy that the Synthetic Challenge has been running 10 weeks. Thank you all for the support during these Challenges!

This week, were looking at Pharmaceuticals again and hope that this one will be able to bring enough variety with some degree of difficulty. As always, if you have any suggestions about the Synthetic Challenge, feel free to PM me!

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference if it is a novel technique. You do not have to solve synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution. You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenge and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any molecule you would like me to challenge the community with, please let me know.

Have fun with this Synthetic Challenge and happy double digits!

Why is the electronegativity of Hydrogen so high compared to other group 1 elements?,15,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1485323211,True,I can't seem to find a concrete answer. Are there any quantum effects involved? Thanks.
Mirr Efficient Ways to Do Dropwise Additions,19,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1485324340,True,"So, I'm doing a synthesis that where one step involves dropwise addition of a reagent. The reaction is run in flame-dried glassware and under calcium chloride drying tubes for further moisture protection. Doing a dropwise addition under those circumstances is difficult at best when using an addition funnel.

I'm also ADHD(legitimately, was diagnosed at 5, have been on meds since), and, despite my fairly successful treatment regimen, I have been unable to make myself truly do a dropwise addition without going too fast at some point. For some reactions, this is okay so long as I don't add all of the reagent at once. However, in this case my reactant **must** be added evenly over a certain period of time; this reaction is extremely sensitive to concentration of the reactant being added dropwise. If I add too much at once the reactant tends to form various oligomers which are undesired.

I can't obtain the slow rate I need from an addition funnel, and adding the reagent manually over the amount of time needed is difficult because it requires me to focus in a manner than I'm not good at(and probably never will be).

I know I can't be the only one that has this problem. Has anyone come up with a better solution than using a simple addition funnel (I.e. something slower/more controllable) that is also compatable with use in anhydrous reactions?

Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated! Thanks! :)

Edit: the title of the post should say more, not Mirr. My autocorrect seems to think ""Mirr"" is a word or something to that effect."

System Suitability testing failure,12,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1485362787,True,"Really need help with this guys as I'm working in a hospital lab and the samples are all currently in backlog because the SST wouldn't pass.

Long story short, I am running this routine assay that was set up in 2014( on every now and then, the SS will become unstable) to run blood samples for Thiopurine metabolites which are 6TGN, 6MP, 6MMPN and the internal standard 8-BA so we screen each run for all 4 analytes. It has gone through validation and was approved by the hospital to use as part of therapeutic drug monitoring for crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

The method is well establishd and has a SOP so there is no way I can change it which I wouldn;t anyway since its an established assay. Typically we equilbrate the system with 15-20 injections and then another 8 injections from the same vial and these 8 injections are when we look at the %RSD for each analyte. Normally the %RSD will be < 2% although we accept anything <5%. However as of recent, it has been going >5% which obviously renders the system unsuitable to run analysis.

The mobile phase A is 2.5mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid PH 2.8 and mobile phase B of ACN with 0.1% formic acid at a ratio 95:5 at a isocratic flow rate of 0.3ML/min for 8 mins of a single run. The column we use is Atlantis T3 Column, 100Å, 3 µm, 4.6 mm X 150 mm with a matching guard column.

The system we are using is LC/MS/MS consisting of a ekisgent microLC autosampler, Agilent 1290 infinity UHPLC with 2 binary pumps( we have 2 pumps/ channels A1B1 for this assay and another A2B2 for a separate project) and linked to AB Sciex Qtrap 5500 MS.

Things I have done so far is to replace both the guard and column, redid the mobile phases, flush the LC system with ACN andwater, replaced the autosampler needle. The retention times for all the analytes did not drift, its just that their areas are varied.

The last time the SST failed was last July and it was down for almost a month and we couldn't find what was ultimately wrong with it, it just decided to get back up again.

I'm looking for suggestions on what other things I can do. As of now, the SST standards we are injecting are pure made fresh from powder and it still cannot make it  %RSD of <5%. 

I'm starting to suspect whether its the autosampler or LC pumps.



Update: Thanks guys for the suggestion. I managed to isolate the problem to the LC channel A1B1 by moving the assay to A2B2 and it worked, the SST pass with RSD if about 1.5%. Something in the channel must have been worn out. Contacted the service engineer who came down, did some checks and said might be the solvent switching valve so they will be replacing that before checking again."

Magnetic Equivalence in NMR?!,3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1485401433,True,"I understand that for magnetic equivalence, the nuclei must be chemically equivalent, and also must have identical couplings to any of the other nuclei.

BUT, if you look at the other fluorine, comparing it to each of the hydrogens again, you ALSO get one-cis-relationship, and one trans-relationship.

Why doesn't the sum of these relationships cancel out? Doesn't each hydrogen have 1 Cis and 1 Trans relationship to each of the fluorines? Shouldn't the Cis H-F and Trans H-F couplings, for each hydrogen, have the same J-coupling value?

Shouldn't these hydrogens be the same?! ARGH"

Oxygen/Calories/Energy and Mental/Motoric Activity,2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1485419642,True,"I was hoping their was a neurochem sub, but it only had one entry like 5 years ago.

I never got to take applied bio or basic chem, so please forgive me if this is a stupid question.

There is this statistic I keep coming across on the internet that is mostly unsourced, but the few that are only point to one source: Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular, and Medical Aspects. I don't have access to this textbook, but my bullshit meter keeps going off. 

The stat is: **Our brains use 20% of the body's energy.**

As I stated, I don't have a strong background in science, but I'm concerned that this is a generalization or mis-statement that has gone around the world twice before the truth has time to put it's pants on.

Here's why I'm asking you Chemists: 

[This article](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/16/10237.full#ref-1) states, 

> ""In the average adult human, the brain represents about 2% of the body weight. Remarkably, despite its relatively small size, the brain accounts for about 20% of the oxygen and, hence, calories consumed by the body. This high rate of metabolism is remarkably constant despite widely varying mental and motoric activity.""

Does oxygen = calories = energy?

I bet that is pretty basic, but my typically strong google-foo is no match for the amount of bullshit on the internet.

Also, their stat about: 

> ""This high rate of metabolism is remarkably constant despite widely varying mental and motoric activity"" 

also sets off my bullshit alarm and is from a paper from 1955... 

So if any of you neurobio/neurochem students/grads/pros/Nobel Prize Scholars have opinions on that or know where I can get updated info, I'd be very grateful.

I have always been confused about how the American education system works and how it applies to Chemistry.

However I'm confused as to how it works in America, you leave high school and go to college (which has a different meaning to college in the UK?) but I also hear about people going to University (instead of college? or are they the same thing?) where you take classes which don't have to be related to earn credits (?) which somehow help you further down the line.

I see a lot of people talking about taking O Chem or an intro to X class, can you just choose your classes and modules from a huge variety of subjects? What stops you from going to University/College to study chemistry and taking a class in something completely unrelated? Is that allowed?

This is going to be a bit of a weird post. To be abrupt, I have pretty bad OCD that manifests as a fear of bugs, specifically bed bugs.

Of course I realised that so much dermal exposure of isopropanol is potentially dangerous due to toxicity and doing this is idiotic. I've gotten rid of the alcohol and taken steps to manage the behavior, including getting on medication. 

My question then is this: does isopropyl alcohol wash completely out of clothing? I would hate to think residues of it stick around and be paranoid about that too - my OCD is really wrecking my life right now in many different forms and I could really use some guidance. Does it persist in the environment, or completely evaporate?

Example of ""physical"" reactions would be swelling clays - water intercalation between the layers.

Example of a ""chemical"" reaction would be oxide to carbonate - e.g. MgO + CO2 -> MgCO3.

I am interested in finding out the reaction that would give the biggest increase in specific volume. Is there a systematic way to do this? Is there a relevant database? Basically can we go beyond anecdotal memories from teaching/research experience to a way of finding this out in a systematic way. Typically materials research has moved to materials that do not have large expansions (because it may cause cracking etc)... so perhaps there are examples from yesteryear that are worth considering?

It should be said that this idea came from a brief discussion related to swelling clays.

The trouble is that my colleague seems to be continually falling far behind on our proposed deadlines of when we might expect submission. Originally, the manuscript was due to be submitted in the Fall of 2016 (our own internal deadline). The grad student has some antisocial tendencies and English isn't his first language, so there are some communication hurdles in dealing with him. Additionally, he is sleep deprived, highly stressed, and overworked. I have communicated clearly with both the PhD student and the PI that I am willing to assist in writing the paper, and have asked when I might expect that process to begin. The PI says I should ask the PhD student. The PhD student doesn't answer my e-mails. 

The lack of a publication would severely limit my chances of getting into a top PhD program for grad school.

Anyone have experience/advice on my predicament? I don't want to be an annoyance and I understand that the life of a PhD student is a stressful struggle, but what can I do to improve my situation?

Thanks!"

I've finished a little over 1/3 of the requirements for PhD (taking everything into consideration) and have felt very discouraged about finishing the program. I'm partially considering just leaving with a M.S. I come from a biology background so everything has been a little challenging.

I'm jealous of the carefree life all the college kids seem to have, what with all their sex and drugs/music and what not while I'm slaving away.

The thing is, I know for sure I want to teach at a community college, it really seems like a great life. Part of me is convincing myself I can do that with M.S.. On the other hand, part of me is telling myself that It'd be worth 3+ more years of suffering to improve my job outlook in the field.

It's been very difficult for me to juggle Cumes, TA, working in the lab, and doing classes.

Trying to understand a new research paper in hydrophobic effect where IR spectroscopy was used.,3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1485617901,True,"Hello out there.

I have to clarify that I'am a biologists and not a chemist or physicist and I'm trying to understand a new paper that published in PNAS (http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1612480114)  about hydrophobic effect. 

Probably some of you already read it and saw that researchers have used IR spectroscopy to determine the stretching of the Hydrogen bonds near the hydrophobic solute. 

Although i got the main idea behind the experiment i didn't understand some basic things. For example why did they use heavy water (HDO) instead of pure water. 

Also if I understood, they calculated the absorbance peaks of heavy water when it is on ice and clathrates form, in order to compare it later with the absorbance peak of the liquid heavy water molecules near the hydrophobic solute. After the comparison they saw a red-shift between the absorbance peak of heavy water molecules near the solute and the heavy water molecules that away from it. Am I right ? 

I would appreciate  if anyone who read it and has the appropriate knowledge (of a chemist or physicist ) tried to explain the process in more accurately way in order to understand it more deeply.

[Named Reaction #2] Buchwald-Hartwig Amination,20,19,False,False,False,chemistry,1485703804,True,"Last time there were requests for coupling reactions. Because this one is near and dear to my heart, I figured I'd make a thread (not to say it's more important than Suzuki-Miyaura, Stille, Negishi, etc). Hope you enjoy.

First, what is it? Traditionally speaking, Buchwald-Hartwig Amination refers to palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions between aryl halides and primary or secondary amines to form new C-N bonds. Although Pd-catalyzed C-N couplings were reported as early as 1983, credit for its development is typically assigned to Stephen L. Buchwald and John F. Hartwig, whose publications between 1994 and the late 2000s established the scope of the transformation. [General Transformation Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Buchwaldhartwig.png)

Why should we care? Many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials contain carbon-nitrogen bonds. Their ubiquitous presence in many molecules of interest has led to the widespread use of this method. In fact, I have heard Phil Baran say ""Every minute of everyday, in labs across the globe, someone is running a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling.""

The generally accepted catalytic cycle / mechanism likely follows some form of [this cycle.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Monophosmechanism.png)
Simplified:
1. A Pd(0) catalyst undergoes oxidative addition with an aryl halide.
2. Transmetallation occurs between the newly formed Pd(II) species and the amine.
3. Base removes the proton from amine (there is evidence for 2 occurring before 3 and 3 before 2).
4. Reductive elimination to form the new C-N bond and regenerate the Pd(0) species.

Much of the work done in this field has led to greater understanding of palladium reactivity across many types of coupling reactions extending far beyond the reach of just C-N bond formation, [ligand design](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/chemical-synthesis/technology-spotlights/buchwald-ligands.html), [precatalyst generation](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/chemical-synthesis/technology-spotlights/buchwald-guide.html), and organometallic chemistry understanding in general.

Numerous reviews have been written on the subject but some of my favorites (and relatively easy to understand) include: [this website](http://www.chemicalsynthesis.info/tag/buchwald-hartwig/), this group meeting pdf from [MacMillan's group](http://chemlabs.princeton.edu/macmillan/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/PVP_Buchwald-Hartwig.pdf), the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchwald%E2%80%93Hartwig_amination) page, and this [new Chemical Reviews](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00512) publication from the Buchwald group."

Properties of a gas,7,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1485718652,True,"I'm curious if a gas 'sticks' or stays on an item it comes in contact with, specifically gasoline gas.
A gasoline smell (or maybe it's car exhaust) entered inside my car yesterday. (Probably because its cold outside and I haven't driven it in a while) and I had to be outside away from the car while letting it warm up. Eventually as the car warmed up and air entered the car, the gasoline smell went away. After letting the car run a little bit longer, I shut it off, opened all 4 of the windows about 1/5 or 1/6 of the way down and let my car stay outside and let the fresh air ventilate the car for about 12 hours. 

I was wondering if this gasoline gas or car exhaust can 'stick' to my car and the items in it. I am concerned gasoline gas or car exhaust will be on my items, making them harmful to touch. I was mainly concerned with clothes, a paper book, a duffle bag, a towel, and my laptop. Do I need to throw these items away? Also I am concerned that the gasoline gas or car exhaust will be on my seats (they're leather seats if material of the seats matter) and rest of the parts of my car, making it basically toxic to be in. I would rather not have to buy another car.

Copper reacts with Rubber Bands - Why?,2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1485801219,True,"I've run into a very strange chemical reaction.

Anyways, I have a number of copper (C145, so copper with a small amount of Tellurium) rods that I was keeping together with ordinary rubber bands.

I'm a mechanical engineer myself, and chemistry was never my strong suit. At first I thought it was some sort of oxide, but then I discovered that rubber bands are made of ordinary vulcanized rubber (I had assumed they were some synthetic material, but apparently not). So now I'm theorizing it's actually a copper-sulfur compound. Can anyone shed some light on exactly what's going on here?"

[Question]: Best way to remove water from Carbowax (PEG 400) after dialysis.,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1485813793,True,"Just wondering what the best way is to remove water from my dialysis bath for reuse. 

I dialyzed a solution of liquid crystals in 4M HCl against water for 3 days followed by dialysis in PEG 400. I'd say I've got about 100 mL of water (and some salt) mixed in with my PEG (~1 L).

Is there a good way to recover the PEG for reuse? I was just going to heat the PEG up at 80C overnight to get rid of any water. Does this make sense or should I just chuck it? Is there a better way?

Thanks!

Total synthesis or methodology Masters project?,6,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1485820636,True,"I am currently trying to pick a project for my one year masters, however I can't decide whether to go for a total synthesis or methodology project.

In the future I want to do a PhD in synthetic organic chemistry, so ultimately I would like to learn as much as possible. Hopefully by the beginning of the project I will have a couple of summers worth of experience.

I feel like I would learn more on a total synthesis project, although it bothers me that one year may not be long enough for such a project, considering I need to hand in a thesis at the end of the year. For methodology I think it would be easier technically - but perhaps just optimizing a reaction may be less interesting.

Is the above true? Do you think that you learn less on a methodology project, or that it might be better for a short term project? if I were to pick methodology, would I be uncompetitive/disadvantaged for a total synthesis DPhil project compared to students who have done total synthesis for their masters projects (and vice versa for methodology DPhil projects) - i.e is it easy to switch between the two as my career progresses.

He is restoring a vintage car and the radiator is totally blocked with solid crystallised coolant. Apparently the type of coolant, once solidified due to lack of flow, becomes impossible to flush out with water as it is not longer soluble. He says that any ""chemical agent"" strong enough to dissolve the crystals will also attack and destroy the tin and lead alloy (silver solder) brazing holding the radiator together. I view that as a challenge, as I think there must be something to attack crystals of organic antifreeze/ionic salt buffer without going after the metal.

Having done some research, the particular coolant composition (AL-3) appears to be:

- Ethanediol (antifreeze)

- Triethanolammonium Orthophosphate (buffer)

- Sodium Mercaptobenzothiazole (corrosion inhibitor and dye) - I'm aware this last one is also pretty nasty

Would I be right in thinking that the salts would be the main culprits in precipitating out as insoluble crystals?

computational methods for amorphous solid structures,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1485954815,True,"Hi, I am investigating how it can be possible to determine atoms positions in an amorphous solid using computational methods.

I'm planning to use DFT methods and approximate the solid with a periodic system with a large period.

It seems to me that some people use the following strategy: start with a crystal, let the system evolve under MD at high temperatures (to simulate the liquefaction of the solid?) and then lowering the temperature as slowly as allowed by the computational resources (to simulate the solidification?). All of this makes sense to me since basically (to my understanding) it try to mimic the real process of glass formation. I have 2 questions though:

* Is there a reason for starting from a crystalline structure and apply heat? Can I just skip this passage and start with a random configuration with the correct density (and atoms not to close to each other)?
* If I have experimental data on the solid (density and Neutron/X-Ray scattering for example) can I just try to find a global minimum for the DFT energy (with monte carlo methods for example) for the configurations that reproduce the experiments?

I am an undergrad studying computational science and am currently enrolled in a class that is cross-listed as a 700-level (PhD students) class for people in the computational science program, and as 500-level (MS & PhD students) for people in [one of] the chemistry program(s) at my University. On the first day of class, we did a review of classical mechanics, and although I recognized all of the Newtonian physics we did, I had never seen Lagrangian and Hamiltonian physics before that day, yet the entire rest of the class seemed to know about it... 

It wasn't a big issue, as I was able to review the material after class and think I have a good understanding of it now, but I think I wanted to ask you all if you could help me figure out how to close gaps in my knowledge in order to understand the course better.

[I knew the professor of the course before the class began, and she recommended I take it; I would like to think my professor felt that I would be able to handle the material!]

Here is a brief summary of my relevant background:

- **Computational Science:**
 - Matlab modeling
 - Python modeling (lots of bioinformatics applications)
 - data mining (language-agnostic)
 - was an undergrad research assistant for a computational lab that ran a stochastic reaction-diffusion simulation [but I didn't understand a lot about the model at the time, so I worry this experience won't help me that much...]
- **Mathematics:**
 - Univariate & Multivariate Calculus
 - Linear Algebra
 - Elementary [Ordinary] Differential Equations
 - Numerical Analysis I (haven't yet taken DiffEq-based Numerical Analysis II)
 - Mathematical Probability
 - Introductory Mathematical Statistics (I understand a lot of the mathematical basis for things, but might not know all of the popular tests, e.g., ANOVA-- I am also learning SPSS in another class though, so this might not be that much of an issue)
- **Physics:**
 - University Physics I & II (ending with electricity and magnetism)
 - College Physics I & II (so I understand most of the thermodynamics, sound, light, etc. things, but only at an algebra-based level)
- **Chemistry:**
 - General [College] Chemistry I & II 
 - Organic Chemistry I & II (mostly about mechanisms, and little/no physical chemistry)
 - Biochemistry I (mostly about biological systems and carb/lipid metabolism-- not about nucleic acids & not a lot about proteins)

We are using JM Haile's *Molecular Dynamics Simulation: Elementary Methods* book, if that happens to be familiar to anyone-- [here is a table of contents](http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/105905755.pdf).

N00b question: is it safe to ferment molasses indoors?,13,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1485980316,True,"So, I know little about chemistry, and I want to use molasses diluted in water to clean rust from metal (link 1) as described in the video. However to get this to work well the mixture should be warmish and as it is winter here, I want to do this in a garage.   

This site (link 2) under safety says ""if water has entered the tank fermentation may have taken place with the generation of carbon dioxide gas, which is asphyxiating and alcohol vapour, which is flammable"".  Now they are talking about *much* larger quantities than 10-20 liters water/molasses, but I don't want to arrive home one day to have burned down the garage ^noteA with the car I'm restoring in it. That would defeat the purpose of removing the rust.    

So the question is it safe to do this indoors in a well insulated garage, how much gas is produced? Enough to start a fire? Or will a fan blowing warm air around dissipate the gas before it can build up enough to ignite?  

Also, this might be a biology question, idk. Apologies if this is the stupidest question ever asked in the history of mankind. 

*noteA: for the fermentation to work, there has to be heat, so there is a heater on a thermostat, which of course creates an electrical spark when it kicks in. Don't want that spark to ignite gas that's been building up for a week.*

"Would someone be so kind as to elaborate on why transparent caulk applies white, then becomes transparent as it cures?",3,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1486090719,True,"As the title says, why does transparent caulk apply white and dry clear? 

I've discussed this with a professor and they had no answer for it (to be clear, I had not found the article when I spoke with them). I found [an article](http://www.askthebuilder.com/caulks/) which relates the white color to the presence of latex. 

Relevant text:

*The white color in the caulk is caused by the presence of latex. The latex in the caulk is derived chemically. It is similar in nature to the milky colored fluid produced from plants belonging to the milkweed family. As the water evaporates from the latex the structure of the caulk changes so that the caulk becomes transparent. Light waves travel directly through the caulk.*

I'm hoping someone can elaborate on the matter, and explain to me precisely how the latex is being incorporated into the matrix (if this indeed is what is occurring). It's an excellent example of making a useful product even better, since one is able to see where they are applying the caulk and remove excess prior to drying. I would just really like to know.

Beakers from your favorite youtuber Nile Red!!,6,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1486161971,True,"I just wanted to share a small review about the beakers Nile Red is selling. I'm a patreon supporter and huge fan.

Obviously you can get quality beakers anywhere cheaply and quick and I don't want this to sound like an advertisement so I'd mainly just like to review the service and quality.

Nile is just starting out and shipping cost are the biggest downside currently for a small business. As a patreon supporter I did receive free shipping so I'm only saying ""downside"" as a noticeable con if I were not one. I think the extra cost for shipping compared to popular purchases from amazon or ebay which usually include free to little cost of getting it to your doorstep are easily overlooked with the safe packaging and mint condition of the products I received.

So to start off since Nile is mainly focused in Canada (i'm southern U.S) and at the time I purchased the beakers he was/still attempting to figure everything out with website design/management, shipping, and in general selling things online so he catered to Canadian customers mainly, being in the U.S we had to speak directly via messaging.

This was actually a breeze and a lot of fun to speak directly to someone I have a lot of respect for. What was suppose to be a simple quote request and purchase turned out to be full conversations that were promptly replied to.

The purchase was simple I just gave him my shipping address, paypal associated email, he gave me an invoice which I paid with paypal, and he messaged me with a confirmation on shipping and tracking number the next day. This isn't relevant but I look up to him a lot and he played a big impact on my life relating to getting safely into amateur chemistry so upon me requesting him to autograph some of the beakers he delivered gladly!

The product arrived in about 5 business days, is was a small box, containing many other small boxes. The packaging was intelligently done with shipping paper safely holding all the individual boxes which were independently taped closed holding more paper and bubble wrap with a large beaker, inside that beaker was a fitting beaker wrapped in bubble wrap with all of the sides protected and internals. Imagine a china doll of beakers with protective shipping materials preventing any movement or collision what so ever.

The beakers themselves had no water spots, scratches, dust, not even a single finger print.

I was extremely happy with my purchase and will purchase these again in the future. The beakers have not been used in any experiments I would consider stress testing but I will update in the future if they do.

I work at Lowe's, as an assembler and a fix it guy. We had a riding mower sit on display for about a year, and I brought it in for inspection before a sale. I cracked open the fuel tank, and at some point someone poured about a gallon of some unknown chemical in it. It's not gas or diesel, it smells like some kind of alcohol based solvent. I've worked with acetone a lot, and it's not that. It smells vaguely like turpentine, but my nose isn't calibrated well. It's clear, and seems slightly less viscous than water.

Our haz-mat vendor won't take any chemicals that we aren't sure about, he needs copies of MSDSs for his paperwork. It's not a fine, he just won't take them. My managers won't let me take it out of the store; I was going to give it to my college's safety kleen guy.

Can difluoroethane damage or dissolve latex?,6,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1486170886,True,"I have a package of twisty balloons (the kind you use for balloon animals). If you've ever used these balloons before, you know that they require too much pressure to blow up by mouth.

It worked beautifully, but I noticed that the balloons started deflating really fast; not ""leaking"" fast, but they almost completely deflate in under 24 hours. The balloons inflated with the air duster also seem to become more pliable and sticky.

Using a rocket duster as a crude air pump, I was able to inflate one of the balloons with regular air, and it has remained satisfactorily plump while its air-duster-filled bretheren have all shriveled up comepletely.

The air duster's contents are listed as 1,1-difluoroethane (though difluoroethane is misspelled on the bottle), and the balloons are natural latex. I googled ""difluoroethane latex"" and got nothing useful, so here I am.

Advice on options after receiving a Bachelor's in chemistry?,4,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1486240563,True,"Hi all! 

I'll keep this as short as I can and can clarify if anyone has questions, but I just wanted some insight on what your experiences/suggestions were after obtaining your Bachelor's in chemistry. 

I graduate next spring, and by then I will have 2 years of industrial chemical experience through an internship that I work part-time during the semester and full-time in summer. I mostly do analytical work, working with instruments such as NMR, GC-MS, HPLC and UPLC. I do enjoy this work, and often find myself being more eager to go to work than going to classes/labs. 

I do enjoy learning chemistry, and because of this I have always considered graduate school (likely a PhD program in analytical/instrumental chemistry). However, after being in school for 3 years, doing undergrad research, and now working industrially, I'm not sure whether I'd be happy completely giving up the industry for 5 years of grad school. I'm sure grad school academia is different than undergrad, but I didn't LOVE being in a research lab, along with academic labs. Also, my boss mentioned to me recently that she'd like to hire me when I graduate, assuming that she can get approval for my hire (this seems likely, but it's 1 year away, so anything can happen). From what I've heard, the starting salary is sustainable (~55k), and I'd definitely make more money here than I would in school. 

One of my other concerns if just how far I can get in the industry without having a graduate degree. I would ideally like to be making ~70k by the time I'm 30, and ~90k by 40 (I'll be 20 yrs old when I begin my salary job, if I end up getting this position), but not sure whether this would be possible given that I wouldn't have a graduate degree. 

Does anyone have any experience with this, whether you just got your degree last semester, or 20 years ago? What's the career growth for Bachelor's chemists with some entry level experience? Or PhD?"

The amount of silica that dissolves in methanol is almost negligible. A reasonable theory is that methanol's high energy of dissolution expands and erodes the silica into smaller pieces; small enough to get carried (by the polar solvent) through the glass frit.

ps. I wonder if you first pre-flush a silica filled column with methanol to get rid of the ultra fine silica fines, then elute another time with methanol, if there will still be silica present in the eluent?

Alternative to Mitsunobu reaction (MsCl),7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1486317370,True,"In nucleoside chemistry, why is the mitsunobu reaction so common? I mean why not just using MsCl/triethylamine with a subsequent NaOH hydrolysis? What are advantages/disatvantages? The only advantage I can think of is that NaOH might be a strong base regarding certain protecting groups.

So let's say we have a 5'-protected 2'-deoxythymidine and I want to synthesize a 3'-Amide. I would actually just use MsCl/TEA to get a 3'-O-Ms group and afterwards hydrolyse it to the 3'-OH(up) group (Hydroxide will attack from the other side SN2 inversion). Next I would do the exact same thing (adding MsCl/TEA to get the 3'-O(up)-Ms) but then add my Amide (nucleophile) to produce the 3'-Amide.

Why should I use mitsunobu for this reaction? I heard that the phosphine oxide can make the column chromatography even more diffucult. I just wanted to hear your thoughts about this regarding simple nucleosides."

Unsuccessful fractional distillation of ethanol from beer,13,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1486339568,True,"Hi all, I'm teaching myself organic chemistry as a hobby and ordered a cheap chinese fractional distillation set off eBay.  Today I tried to distill ethanol from beer. I used a 250mL rb flask in a boiling water bath atop a hotplate, filled with 100ml of green line IPA.  The bath was boiling for at least an hour, maybe more , yet the beer in the boiling flask never reached a boil. The thermometer in the frac column never exceeded 40 degrees C, but I saw drops of ethanol forming in the column, as high as the thermometer bulb even, and dripping back down into flask. I did not use insulating glass wool, nor did I use a stir bar in the flask. Should I have used an oil bath instead? It felt more like a reflux than a distillation. I'm wondering why the beer never boiled even after being in contact with boiling water for an  hour plus. I assumed the beer would boil at less than 100 degrees, since it is primarily water, and that the water bath would heat the solution to 100 degrees since it was nearly submerged in the bath."

"[Rant] I feel like I've wasted my degree and 4 years, where do i go from here?",7,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1486400118,True,"I am from the UK. I haven't used my degree in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and i have no relevant experience in the field (I graduated with a Third Class Honours - I know, I fucked up, I wasted the opportunity and my time on a 4 year course). I also now feel like I have forgotten the vast majority of what I did learn while I was there.

 

When I graduated in the summer of 2014 I tried my hardest applying for countless chemistry graduate jobs (the vast majority i was under-qualified to even be considered - minimum requirements of 2.1 or 2.2 classification). I ever only received one interview of which I was unsuccessful.
 
 

So I had joined the Job Centre. This is where I had weekly meetings, where you get paid a small amount of money when you provide evidence that you have been looking for a job. My Advisor had suggested doing week-long course to work in a warehouse where i would be guaranteed an interview at the end. I felt like I had to say yes because I needed the money and if not they would assume that I didn't want a job and would stop the money - I did want a job but not in a warehouse.
 
 

I got the job in the warehouse. For 3 months I did shift work - 4 days on 4 days off, 48 hours in 4 days which works out at 12 hours a day. During this time, I didn't apply for any chemistry based jobs, due to being so tired and demotivated. I was laid off as there was no work after Christmas (Dec 2014).
 
 

I was then unemployed for 3 more months still applying for jobs in the Chemistry sector. I was then contacted by the same warehouse to work for another 3 months.
 
 

Approximately 1 year later (June/July 2015) after graduating I had gotten referred by a friend to work at an online travel agent in customer services (£17,000 a year). After 6 months I was internally promoted to the Corporate Travel team (1st Jan 2016 - £17,500 a year) which I had worked for until November 2016.
 
 

I was then approached on LinkedIn by one of the world’s largest hotel companies to work as a global sales coordinator in the meeting and events department, where i am currently working (£18,000 a year). The role I am currently doing is basically an admin role, however when I had the phone interview and face-to-face interview this was never really expressed to me actually how much it is basically just admin / data entry. Basically, we receive requests and send them to the hotels directly and then the hotels go directly back to the client with us in copy with a proposal for the meeting/event. A quarter of my time is spent chasing the hotels for a response or a follow up to the client for an answer… the other three quarters is spent entering data into salesforce to track the requests which come through to the inbox. There is no sales involved.

 

So after explaining all of this, basically I am wondering would it be possible for me to get back into a chemistry based job? I am extremely unhappy in the job I currently have, as I feel like it has been misled. Ideally it would be something chemistry based, or alternatively account management or even sales? I assume the job title I have sounds good going forward and I could easily exaggerate the truth of the role, but that’s about it.

 

Any questions if you would like me to expand on anything posted, let me know.

[Named Reaction #3]: 'Click' Chemistry,16,52,False,False,False,chemistry,1486423976,True,"Why you should care? One of the most widely used reactions in all of science. Might one day win a nobel prize. Used in pharmaceutical development, biological studies, and is very user-friendly. It's one of those reactions that, under most circumstances, just works!

""Click Chemistry"" is a term that was introduced by K. B. Sharpless in 2001 to describe reactions that are high yielding, wide in scope, create only byproducts that can be removed without chromatography, are stereospecific, simple to perform, and can be conducted in easily removable or benign solvents. This concept was developed in parallel with the interest within the pharmaceutical, materials, and other industries in capabilities for generating large libraries of compounds for screening in discovery research. Several types of reaction have been identified that fulfill these criteria, thermodynamically-favored reactions that lead specifically to one product, such as nucleophilic ring opening reactions of epoxides and aziridines, non-aldol type carbonyl reactions, such as formation of hydrazones and heterocycles, additions to carbon-carbon multiple bonds, such as oxidative formation of epoxides and Michael Additions, and cycloaddition reactions.


[Copper catalyzed and heat activated examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_chemistry#/media/File:Azide_Alkyne_cycloaddition.png)

For example, an examination of the azide-alkyne cycloaddition shows that it fulfills many of the prerequisites. Many of the starting monosubstituted alkynes and organic azides are available commercially, many others can easily be synthesized with a wide range of functional groups, and their cycloaddition reaction selectively gives 1,2,3-triazoles.

The Bertozzi group further developed one of Huisgen’s copper-free click reactions to overcome the cytotoxicity of the CuAAC reaction. Instead of using Cu(I) to activate the alkyne, the alkyne is instead introduced in a strained difluorooctyne (DIFO), in which the electron-withdrawing, propargylic, gem-fluorines act together with the ring strain to greatly destabilize the alkyne. This destabilization increasing the reaction driving force, and the desire of the cycloalkyne to relieve its ring strain.
[Scheme of the Strain-promoted Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_chemistry#/media/File:Strain-promoted_Azide-Alkyne_Cycloaddition.png)

This reaction proceeds as a concerted [3+2] cycloaddition in the same mechanism as the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Substituents other than fluorines, such as benzene rings, are also allowed on the cyclooctyne.

This reaction has been used successfully to probe for azides in living systems, even though the reaction rate is somewhat slower than that of the CuAAC. Moreover, because the synthesis of cyclooctynes often gives low yield, probe development for this reaction has not been as rapid as for other reactions. But cyclooctyne derivatives such as DIFO, dibenzylcyclooctyne (DIBO) and biarylazacyclooctynone (BARAC) have all been used successfully in the SPAAC reaction to probe for azides in living systems.

The [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_chemistry) is very detailed, this [Chem Soc Rev](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2007/CS/B613014N#!divAbstract) talks about applications, [this review](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3773\(20010601\)40:11%3C2004::AID-ANIE2004%3E3.0.CO;2-5/abstract) has been cited almost 10,000 times (!), and [this is a solid simplistic mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_chemistry#/media/File:CuAAC_Catalytic_Cycle.png) depiction."

Have a question about CO2 and pH for Electrodeionization (water treatment),0,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1486461285,True,"Hello,
I have a question about CO2 levels in Reverse Osmosis and Electrodeionization (EDI) systems. Since CO2 is gas , in reverse osmosis , membranes does not reject CO. However, CO2 is unwanted in Electrodeionization systems. CO2 is usually lowered by  increasing pH by adding caustic. One of the systems we observed this results:

6.8 pH (high alkalinity in water present) - HCl Dosage  (6.2 pH) - 1.Pass Reverse Osmosis (5 pH) - NaOH Dosage (8.4 pH )- 2.Pass Reverse Osmosis -  EDI 

As seen above, the water entering the 2nd pass is increased to 8.4 from 5 with the caustic dosage. Based on our previous knowledge, we expect CO2 level to be 0, but here we have measured 13.25 mg / l CO2. We also measured the pH from 3 different devices to confirm the pH. We repeated the measurements 4 times, but each time we observed the same result. Then we unloaded the 1st Pass and renewed the water, and we tried the following;

6.8 pH (high alkalinity present in water) - 1.Pass Reverse Osmosis (6.1 pH)- NaOH Dosage (8.8 pH)-  2.Pass Reverse Osmosis - EDI 

When we turned off the acid dosage, we observed that the CO2 level dropped to 0. if bicarbonate is present in water, the dosage of Hydrochloric acid will emit CO2;
 2HCO3 + 2HCl = 2CO2 + 2H2O + Cl2 as can be seen from this equation . But is it not possible to get this CO2 out by raising of the pH level with caustic? Is there any effect of carbonic acid produced by CO2 gas in water? At what pH level we can ensure there is no CO2 present?

Trouble with chloroformate and ester double derivatization before GC-MS,8,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1486482188,True,"Hi, does anyone here have experience of double derivatizations using ethyl chloroformate and methyl esters before running a compound down a GC?  I'm following a method of [double derivatizing](http://imgur.com/qU7MlqW) (note red is ethyl chloroformate deriv and blue is methanol deriv) [glutathione](http://imgur.com/LL96TpI) (tripeptide) from a [few papers](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jms.185/abstract) that has hardly changed but I can't get it working.

In short:
1 mL of glutathione and DTT (reducing agent to prevent glutathione disulphide forming) are shaken with 200 µL of ethyl chloroform for 10 mins at RT.  The pH is adjusted to 1.5 with HCl (I think to deactivate the unreacted chloroformate) and excess NaCl is added before the product extracted 3x with 3 mL diethyl ether.  This is evaporated under N2 and the small amount of glassy solid/oily solid resuspended in 1 mL acidic MeOH (1 drop 37% HCl in 1 mL MeOH).  This is then heated to 80 'C for 10 minutes and solvent evaporated again.  The final compound is then taken up in 400 µL of ethyl acetate and 1 µL run on the GC-MS (10:1 split, 150-300 'C run over 12 minutes, 270 'C injector temp).

At the moment i'm just getting a single large peak on the GC with a mass spectrum that doesn't correspond to the expected published spectrum for derivatized gltuathione.  It's got major peaks at 299 and 149 m/z and I think it might be the chloroformate [reacting with the thiols of DTT](http://imgur.com/K4YTdZK).

I sometimes get a small peak on the GC which has exactly the spectrum that i'm looking for, but i'm not sure why it doesn't always appear and why it has such a low area compared to the major side product peak.

Has anyone tried this derivatization or similar before?  Does anyone have anything they can suggest trying?

Thanks!"

Where would be the best place to get an analysis on soil for aluminum and barium? (additional advice requested below),9,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1486486080,True,"You might have already guessed it, but I'm interested in testing a claim by chemtrail conspiracy theorists. Not sure if this is where I want to post this, if there is a better place please let me know. I really want to do an actual test instead of just arguing with people and we just throw sources at each other.

The claim is generally that chemtrails have been sprayed across the U.S. (if not the world) since 1997. Some say longer. They say that the free elements of aluminum and barium are not found in nature. My hypothesis is that if I did one soil test from the first inch of soil and another one foot down, I should find aluminum and barium in the first inch but not the one deeper down. I know I will have to check the rate of accumulation in my area to ensure I go back far enough in time so the alleged chemtrails do not change my results. I might even get another soil sample tested that I would put aluminum shavings in. This would hopefully show that the people performing the test are not just part of the conspiracy.

Guard cartridge methods on UPLC,7,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1486488714,True,"So our lab has a shiny new Agilent 1260 Infinity UPLC coupled with our trusty QTOF-MS, but nobody here has any experience with them.

My question, then: does anyone here have any experience using just a guard with UPLC? I'm finding some nice 5mmx2.1mm, 1.9um C18 guards that are looking really appealing right now. I'm practically salivating at even the remote possibility of having a <2min method.

Our planet is the size of a soccer ball...?,3,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1486512315,True,"Apologies upfront if this post is in the wrong Reddit, but here it goes. The other day I read that if you would compress the empty space in between molecules, neutrons, protons and what have you, the earth would be the size of a soccer ball. Something like the distance between molecules is the same as between planets in our Milky Way. And the distance between the elements of within a molecule, are likewise spaced out. It's like if you look at the stars and imagine their distances, you will find such distances as well when peering into molecules. That just totally blew my mind. Fascinating! 

Still, a piece of wood or a stone, seem pretty solid, despite being invisible to the naked eye when compressed, So how come such solid-looking object are actually filled with emptiness? I wanted to say, filled with air, but I guess that'd be wrong. So the next question would be, what are they filled with? If the space between molecules is vacuum, wouldn't that collapse onto itself? And a final question, how come we can describe a surface as smooth when actually that surface has huge ""holes"" in it? At least, if you would look at a surface under a microscope that could zoom in on individual molecules, you would find vast stretches of emptiness in between molecules.

IMA gallery artist; I paint with magnetic inks. I am trying to make a solution of chromatic Ferrofluid using iron fillings and acrylic calligraphers ink. Ask Me Anything!,5,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1486569259,True,"I do not have a great deal of education in chemistry (some AP classes from about 13 years ago) and most of my experiments in making chromatic ferrofluids come from AskScience and Google searches. I hope to learn from you and maybe do a little self-promotion in the process. I would love to show you what I have learned and talk about my experiments. If you would like to see examples of my art feel free to visit my Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/aloysius_savant/

**Edit: More information**

Beginning in 2011 and continuing in 2016, my goal has been to make chromatic ferrofluids able to [spike and flower](http://i.imgur.com/SKpWand.gifv) for 2 Dimensional Art. I am now permanently hanging in two very hip [art gallerys](http://www.ouvertgallery.com) and I have an art show beginning on the 20th where I will paint in front of an audience. 

I consider my art style to be a retro-call-back to the Abstract Expressionists and I call my style Abstract Transhumanism. I call it this because I title my art and use processes that celebrates scientific progress. Here are some examples of my ferrofluids on canvas: [A Summer Cabin on Proximia B](http://i.imgur.com/zIzRXAn.jpg), [A Past Life Experience](http://imgur.com/8apWAse.jpg), [Panspermic Magic](http://i.imgur.com/tn40pu8.jpg), and [The Rainforest of Tau Ceti](http://imgur.com/2P7RGMg.jpg).

 I use Neodymium magnets to paint instead of the traditional brushes. Despite my recent accomplishments, I cannot feel truly satisfied with my art and move on to experimenting with other scientific oddities such as [Bismuth](http://i.imgur.com/980JL.jpg) and Gallium until I conquer the task of making a chromatic solution of Ferrofluid.  

I have come a long way since I first felt an overwhelming compulsion to paint with the trails left behind ferrofluid. In 2011, I began with CMY(-K) printer toner, iron powder and vegetable oil. It was about as simple a process as you would expect: measure, mix and stir. Here is a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUBnHTcpF5o) where I paint using this solution. This video really illustrates the problems I experience with Suspension Mixtures. Also, the process left the ink too dark and did not properly display the colors to the extent that I wanted. 

Fast forward to the months following March 2016, I graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design and decided to put my aspirations of being a Science Fiction novelist on hold and return to this painting process. I have experimented with new solutions since my return. I now have large bottles of Iron Fillings and Iron Oxide as well as acrylic oils, acrylic calligraphers ink and pigment powder. Here is a brief outline of my conclusions:

**Successes with Iron Powder and Calligraphers Ink** I will start with my best current process. The bulk of my paintings comes from a mixing a bottle of [Daler-Rowney Artist Ink](http://imgur.com/bKOzdlj.jpg) with a tablespoon of Iron powder and a dash of Flackseed Oil or Vegetable Oil. I mix and then remove any excess oil using an eyedropper. I also use an eyedropper to apply the mixture to canvas. I bottle them in small glass Ball jars and they last for 4-5 paintings. I must stir and shake the mixture if it has been resting. 
The mixtures very. At best, the iron has satisfactory control over the acrylic, I can slide the iron along the canvas and I only have to tilt slightly to get the excess acrylic to follow. There are two worst case scenarios for this mixture. The first is that the Iron separates from the Ink and I have Zero control. The second is the Acrylic and Oil become immiscible and the Oil pools and this can ruin my painting. Red and Orange acrylic inks have proven to be the most likely to become immiscible (I do not know why).

**The failures with Iron Oxide:**

**Iron Oxide and Ink**: I believe the only thing darker than Iron Oxide is Vantablack Carbon Nanotubes and the monsters from [Attack the Block](http://i.imgur.com/PmUMXu1.gif). Mixtures of Iron Oxide and calligraphers ink have proven to be useless. The color is lost. Therefor, my experiments with this have been sparse due to costs, waste, and little proven reward. However, I have not been able to experiment with Red Iron Oxide and I believe there may be hope for a process such as this.

**Iron Oxide and Iron Powder mixture with Pigment Powder and Vegetable Oil** I experimented with this process only once while working on [Altruism in a Shattered Unreality](http://i.imgur.com/EUV9NIe.jpg). If you look at the top left corner of this painting you will see a flakey and spotty texture that is different from the rest of the work. The mixture separated from the metal quickly, became difficult to control and did not spread properly. **I do not believe this is a dead process or that I am done experimenting with it.** I believe Iron Oxide is the key to making a solution of chromatic ferrofluid. In the future when I have the money to buy more resources, I will return to this process using Flaxseed Oil.

**The acrylic oil** is useless for making ferrofluids because I need a low viscosity. I use it mostly for making a gesso primer but I would not be opposed to experimenting with it.

Please, suggest new processes for making these ferrofluids. I am curious to know if heating the mixture would produce a new result. Also understand, I fit the stereotype of “starving artist” and until my paintings start selling, I am very limited in materials I can afford. I would love to buy those scientific ferrofluid bottles from teachersource.com but the cost of such an object is discouraging. Thank you for reading this far. And I hope I used the word “immiscible” properly."

Undergraduate unhappy with research lab,23,33,False,False,False,chemistry,1486583645,True,"Hello! I'm sorry in advance for the long post, I just am kind of lost in my current situation and would really appreciate some words of wisdom.

So I am a sophomore pursuing a degree in chemistry. I began undergraduate research as a freshman my spring semester and stayed with the group for a couple months. The environment was very relaxed, (only came in once a week) and I did not enjoy the specific field of research

I switched labs, and for the past 6 months I have been researching with a new group, working on organic synthesis. I got paired with a graduate student, and I am in the lab usually 5 days a week and on average about 4 hrs each of those days.

I'm not sure if I'm genuinely unhappy, or just not used to the job. My graduate student gives me a LOT of independence. If I have questions or concerns he absolutely answers them, but I never have someone over my shoulder looking over me. Because of this, I feel very inadequate with basic techniques (columns, refluxing, setting up reactions, etc.) and 95% of the things I do set up don't work. When I talk to my graduate student about what went wrong he just suggests I try again...

It's understandable that if I am setting up a column after the 15th time I shouldn't need him to look over me, but when it doesn't work I don't feel properly trained in anything! Sometimes I'm not even confident that I can clean glassware.

I feel like an idiot in the lab, and whenever I'm confused or do not know what to do I ask questions. This usually ends up with different people telling me different things (set it up this way, or why are you setting it up that way; this way is better) so I try my best to follow the internet for certain methods, or to incorporate all the advice I've gotten which ends up confusing me.

The biggest problem with the research so far is that I don't feel like I am learning from this experience because I keep making mistakes and I don't know what they are or how to fix them. It seems like I'm in this endless loop, and before I even walk into the lab I have dread and doubt in my abilities as a chemist. I rarely look forward to going into work because I just feel like I will screw up and waste an entire day. 

I've communicated with both my PI and the graduate student about my unhappiness with the situation a couple months ago, but all it really seemed to do was make the working environment awkward for a couple of weeks and everything returned to how it used to be. My PI did try to correct the problem by having us all lay down some expectations, but I believe that the issue is inherent in my mentor or myself. Both of them are great people, it just doesn't seem like the graduate student really cares about how or what I learn, and the more questions I ask the more I feel like I'm just annoying him. What makes me feel worse is that my other chemistry friends in different research labs seem to love their mentors, genuinely enjoy spending time in lab, and do not have the same frustrations I do. There was a possibility of me switching to a different graduate student, but every grad student already has an undergrad.

Currently I am on a project that (if it works) I will get a paper published. The prospect of publishing a paper as an undergraduate is very appealing to me, as my original plan is to pursue a PhD in chemistry, and having a first author article would increase my chances of getting into a good school. But sometimes it just feels like this ""paper"" is held over my head and it's one of the few things that is stopping me from completely switching groups. Also, I feel ridiculous for talking about grad school when I'm not enjoying undergraduate research, and it sometimes makes me question whether or not I like being in a chemistry lab, or if I don't like the way I'm learning.

I really feel like I enjoy the chemistry, science, and the profession. I can picture myself working in a laboratory for the rest of my life, and I do want to be nothing more than a bad-ass synthetic chemist, but I don't feel confident in anything when I'm at the lab and if I stay in this lab I still don't think I will be at all ready for graduate school research by the time I get my bachelors.

I like the independence because it forces me to discover on my own, but I just feel like I'm wasting chemicals and I'm not getting anywhere. I keep failing and haven't gotten a win in a long time. It's discouraging, and I do not feel like I'm learning how to not fail, I'm just learning that I don't know what I'm doing. There's very little instruction, teaching, and guidance on what I do day-to-day, and I don't have really anyone to look up to because I'm not really under anyone's ""wing"". 

It could just be my insecurities, but I think that perhaps this group (and mentor) is not a good fit for me, but I still want to do research. However, since this is my second lab, I am hesitant to switch groups because I don't even know if I'll have the same sort of problems or if it'll be better. I also don't want to diminish my chance for grad school if they look at my application and see that I constantly jump from group to group. BUT I feel like another year or two at this lab and I'll start to really resent chemistry and my decision to stay. Heck... I don't know.

Thank you for reading. What do you guys think? :/

We have been trying to optimize the 90 degree pulse for a couple days now and cannot seem to get it right. According to what I have read, the optimization should give you a series of peaks that looks like a sin wave, and the second zero point divided by 4 should give you the optimum pulse width.

When we run the optimization though the peaks never go negative, it looks more like a sin^2 wave. I don't know if we can still calculate the optimum pulse width from that or if we are doing something wrong.

Advice on possibly getting two master's in different fields of Chemistry? Please help!,9,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1486698616,True,"Hey guys, any advise on my situation is greatly appreciated.


I will be completing my BSc in Chemistry with a Biochem concentration this summer. My short term goal is to obtain a Master's degree in Analytical Chemistry. Eventually I would like to pursue a PhD in Sustainable Energy.


My top choice for a Master's program is the University of Amsterdam, which would be abroad (I'm in the US). My plan is to apply in over a year, that way I have time to work and save up/ pay off some small loans.


I also plan to take night classes in the meantime at the school I am about to graduate from. I will also continue to work in a research lab I am currently in. I would have to pay out of pocket to do this, but I want to continue working on my research and take courses so that I can continue learning and building qualifications.


HERE'S THE QUESTION: I'm considering just going ahead and applying to my alma mater as a master's student since they would give me a stipend and waive tuition to do literally the SAME THING I WOULD BE DOING as a ""post-bac"" student.


Is it bad/ weird/ taboo/ strange/ etc to obtain two Master's degrees? The degrees would ultimately contain much different coursework, different research, different program structures, different countries, etc. Would this have a negative image for some reason though on job applications, applications to the second master's, etc?


Hypothetically, I could call the first one a MSc in Organic and the second a MSc in Analytical. Or I could call the first one Analytical and the second Energy Sustainability (which they offer).


Again, the GOAL is to end up at UvA. I would pursue this, since logistically nothing in my life would change, my plan would not change, the only difference is I'd be getting a stipend instead of paying out of pocket.


Thank you in advance for your time and advice!"

Procedure for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles with ascorbic acid and PVA?,2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1486789957,True,"Hello everyone,

I'm a high school student and I'm currently investigating the relationships between peak absorption, amount of reducing agent, and amount of stabilizing agent used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). One of the methods I am using to synthesis AgNPs is through reduction with ascorbic acid while using PVA (polyvinyl alcholol) as a stabilizer. However, I was unable to access any detailed experimental procedures that would explain this process. So far, papers by [Zielinska et al](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1876619609003933/1-s2.0-S1876619609003933-main.pdf?_tid=6a478730-f018-11e6-9760-00000aab0f02&acdnat=1486790013_93237cf7192e7e3cd048d50e236a3e2b) and [El-Kheshen et al](http://www.derpharmachemica.com/pharma-chemica/effect-of-reducing-and-protecting-agents-on-size-of-silvernanoparticles-and-their-antibacterial-activity.pdf) have been useful for providing a basic framework, but they didn't provide exact details regarding procedure used. They did mention amounts and concentrations of AgNO3, ascorbic acid, and PVA to be used, but they don't explain temperature conditions, or pH conditions, or any finer minutia of actually conducting the experiment. When I tried to follow their procedure (using only 5 mL of solutions rather than the 100 they used, but with solute mass adjusted accordingly for roughly equal concentration), by adding ascorbic acid solution to AgNO3 solution at room temperature, drop by drop, the result was a greyish brown transparent solution (which didn't display the vivid colors colloidal AgNP solutions are supposed to show), which leads me to believe the particles were too large to display localized surface plasmon resonance in the visible band. This means I must not have completed the procedure correctly.

Would anyone be able to provide me with more a exact and detailed procedure?

Thank you! Your help is much appreciated. "

Why is it so hard to report plagiarism?,42,56,False,False,False,chemistry,1486827800,True,"Recently I discovered two almost identical, and in places copied and pasted, articles on synthetic methodology (both published within the last 6 months). 
Amazingly, neither journal has any link on their website which I could find for reporting apparent plagiarism. Not only that, but I caught the outright copying easily and it's something that should have been picked up in peer review. If the integrity of the chemical literature is important to us as chemists, we should demand that journals make it easy and anonymous to alert editors to fraudulent publications.

The chemical literature becomes useless when polluted with misleading and false protocols, reactions, workups, and yields. We need to instill the significance of this into young researchers - and the absolute importance of scientific integrity.

edit: ChemistrySelect by Wiley, Tet Lett by Elsevier, and Synthetic Communications by Taylor&Francis - not small name publishers. For those interested, here are the papers in question:  

[Tetrahedron Letters 1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.09.092)  

[Tetrahedron Letters 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.11.086)  

[Synth. Commun.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00397911.2016.1224351)  

[ChemistrySelect](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.201601602)  

Additionally, and highly suspiciously, they all refer to water as a ""grenary"" (or ""greenary"" in one case) solvent. If you Google ""grenary solvent"" you get the ChemistrySelect paper as the fourth result. If you can read the articles, it's obvious, in my opinion, that these papers are all related to a common ancestor. 

One of the articles (Synth. Commun.) discussing the cobalt-mediated reaction contains the phrase ""The optimization of the reaction conditions was carried out with aniline as model substrate
using different bases, solvents, and **copper sources** at varied temperatures"" (emphasis mine).

"Getting used to a research group's ""culture""",26,51,False,False,False,chemistry,1486927547,True,"I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I am definitely in need of some advice. 

I'm a 4th year undergrad who will be taking an extra semester in the fall to take additional classes and focus on research. I started research with a new group back in September (so I've been here about 5 months) on a project I absolutely love. Everything is great about my research--except for the people in my lab. 

I originally was placed under a grad student and another undergraduate as my mentors, but the grad student got his PhD, and the undergraduate is no longer a part of our group. My PI basically handed the project down to me, and while I would love to be more independent, I feel like I have been thrown into the deep end. Without anyone directly above me, I have no one to ask questions to about my project (except my PI, who is notoriously difficult to reach). I also have some general lab questions as I am still relatively new, like where certain reagents are, how to troubleshoot or use some instruments, etc., and whenever I ask my labmates, they either help me (very begrudgingly) or tell me they don't know and leave me to figure it out myself. For example: Someone told me to make sure the HPLC UV detector wasn't leaking, so I asked how I would know, and she said ""Umm.. it's hooked up to a computer so obviously it will tell you...""

I know that the grad students are busy and they probably just think of me as a dumb undergrad, but my friend's research group does not function like this. She's said that she can ask anyone in her lab a question without a problem. Anytime I ask a question, I get an eyeroll and sometimes an answer. 

I also feel like everyone in my group is good friends with each other except for me. This isn't a huge deal to me; I don't need to be friends with them. I just want to feel like I fit in at least a little and be comfortable enough to ask simple questions. 

As I said, I really love my project, so I don't want to switch groups. I just don't know if I can deal with the clique-y, unfriendly atmosphere of my group. I know the obvious solution is to talk to my PI, but I don't even know what to say without throwing everyone in my lab under the bus or seem like I'm complaining about not fitting in. 

Thanks in advance for any advice! "
How can I synthesize ferrocyanide?,5,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1486932247,True,"Every year I have my students synthesize inorganic paint pigments, to do going-away paintings at the end of the year, and it has come to that time again when synthesis efforts should be underway.  We've got a procedure for synthetic azurite, but it's kind of a weak pigment and always vaguely clumpy - I'd like to upgrade to Prussian Blue.   Of course we have potassium ferrocyanide in stock, as well as ferric nitrate, so just mixing those ought to produce half-decent blue pigment.  But seriously, that's not so far from just ordering Prussian Blue, is it?  The hard part of the compound is the ferrocyanide ion.  Really, I'd be stoked if we could make it.  Just imagining lining up the iron and carbons and nitrogens, that's exciting to me, having these atoms all organize in neat symmetry.

I do understand that this ion is prepared using hydrogen cyanide in modern industry.  Of course I'd never want to replicate this in my classroom.  

However, historically ferrocyanide came first, as far as I know, cyanide being prepared later as a degradation product of ferrocyanide.  According to Wiki, ferrocyanide was first prepared by combining iron filings, potassium carbonate, and nitrogen/carbon sources such as 'torrified horn, leather scrap, offal, or dried blood'.

As far as iron filings, there are plenty around, as my predecessor really liked thermite.  I suspect that KOH would be a reasonable substitute for potassium carbonate, and we do have that on hand.  I don't know if sodium carbonate would work?  If not, I guess there's always Amazon.  Really the sticking point here is that I need a more convenient and less gross substitute for 'dried blood' or 'offal' or whatever the heck 'torrified horn' might be.... Would urea do? Biuret?  Glycine?  Ferric nitrate and charcoal?

My hope would be that I could fire up some sort of mess like that, extract with water and filter, and add ferric chloride to precipitate the blue.  

Has anyone any experience or advice doing this?  A procedure of some sort?  I know this is a long shot, and I'll probably try random things anyway - with the help of students.  But I'd like to start by asking for expertise.

[Named Reaction #4]: Olefin Metathesis,9,36,False,False,False,chemistry,1486986721,True,"**What is it?** Olefin (*synonym = alkene*) metathesis is an organic reaction that entails the redistribution of fragments of alkenes (olefins) by the scission and regeneration of carbon-carbon double bonds. [Like this.
](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/sokolowsky1/images/f2big.gif)

**Why should you care?** This reaction won a Nobel Prize in 2005 (Bob Grubbs, Dick Schrock, and Yves Chauvin shared). Olefin metathesis was first commercialized in petroleum reformation for the synthesis of higher olefins from the products (alpha-olefins) from the Shell higher olefin process (SHOP) under high pressure and high temperatures. Modern catalysts can be used for a variety of specialized organic compounds and monomers. Modern applications include the synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs, macrocyclic crownophanes the manufacturing of high-strength materials, the production of propylene, the preparation of cancer-targeting nanoparticles, and the conversion of renewable plant-based feedstocks into hair and skin care products. 

**What does the mechanism look like?** [Here](http://allthingsmetathesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/metathesis-mechanism.png). Chauvin's major contribution was in proposing a mechanism that proceeded via a metallocycle intermediate. The Chauvin mechanism involves the [2+2] cycloaddition of an alkene double bond to a transition metal alkylidene to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The metallacyclobutane produced can then cyclorevert to give either the original species or a new alkene and alkylidene.

**What else is cool?** More than just taking two simple alkenes and changing the substituents, olefin metathesis can be used to close rings (Ring Closing Metathesis, RCM), Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP), Ring Opening Metathesis (ROM), Enzyme metathesis, Acyclic Diene MEtathesis Polymerization (ADMET). [Here is a schematic](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/chemistry/chemical-synthesis/migration2/image11.gif) of each for clarity.

**Further Reading:** Andy Myers has a dope presentation on it [here](https://www.faculty.chemistry.harvard.edu/files/myers/files/31-the_olefin_metathesis_reaction.pdf), MacMillan's group did a solid one [here](https://www.princeton.edu/chemistry/macmillan/group-meetings/WSJ-RCM.pdf), there's a whole website dedicated to metathesis [here](http://allthingsmetathesis.com/what-is-olefin-metathesis/), and for shiggles, here's Grubbs's [Nobel Lecture](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/grubbs-lecture.html).

Obviously, you should [check out the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olefin_metathesis), and as with any reaction that was developed by competing scientists, you should look into the delicate relationship between Schrock and Grubbs. There are some really interesting personal stories out there! Cheers! (*Feel free to leave requests for next week's reaction in the comments*)"

Does this mean that they actually liked me and want to give me an idea of what it's like to work there so that I will accept when they give a job offer, or is this just a normal thing that they always do at these sorts of jobs regardless of how the interviews go, and is more of a formality?

It feels like they wouldn't bother touring the labs with you if they didn't intend to hire you, sort of like how they rarely contact references unless they are seriously considering you for the role.

The solution the flask is submerged in is liquid nitrogen, as some of the deicers I'm testing have freezing points < -50 F. The walls of the tube holding the liquid are vacuum sealed. The tube holds up well during the test, but the issue is during the thaw of the tube. I remove the tube from the nitrogen and leave it at room temperature to thaw. When i come back later, or the next day, i find the small bulb at the bottom of the tube has shattered, ruining the vacuum seal and making the tube useless. The first picture is the bulb intact, the second is the broken one with the liquid inside the walls of the tube.

I was able to avoid breaking the bulb by placing the tube in a freezer at -10 F instead of room temperature, but thawing in this way takes too long as i need to perform multiple tests in a day.

What's the best way to purify Isopropyl Alcohol?,10,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1487130796,True,"Hi guys!  I am doing a project where I build a cloud chamber for school.  To do this I need 99% Isopropyl Alcohol but I have on hand some 70% and some 91%.  I know I can easily buy 99% online, but I thought it would be more fun to do it myself.  That said, how should I go about this?  

I read up on salting and have had some success with that but I was wondering if there was a better way (like freezing the water out???)  to do this.  Also, I was wondering if there was any way afterward I could test the solution and actually make sure it is highly concentrated.

Experience with racemization of an enantiopure compound?,13,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1487186100,True,"I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this happening. 

I previously made a racemic mixture where the stereocenter is an amine, and separated on chiral HPLC. We wanted to know the absoulte configuration though, so I went ahead and used a synthetic route resulting in the (S)-enantiomer. 

This was probably a month ago, when I went to analyze the purity on the HPLC, just to double check, there were two peaks, at basically the same elution time as the two peaks seen with the racemate.

I collected the peaks from the (S)-compound, and immediately put them on the HPLC individually, and there was about 98% ee. But when I left them in solution at -40 overnight and checked them again there was maybe 80% ee (I'm going to check agaian tomorrow to see if more converted).

I was thinking that there may be atropisomers present (as I have a weakly hindered biphenyl system present), but, the interconverting peaks match up very well with the racemate peaks.

I'm not very familiar with stereocenters just converting back and forth on their own, and we have similar compounds in this series that don't show this phenomenon. Anyone experience this before?

I don't see any way for the structure to convert ([strcutrue here](http://imgur.com/a/BrBQ2). May is just be a coincidence that the atropisomers are eluting at the same time as the enantiomers from the racemic mixture?

Why are these several engineering materials so expensive?,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1487226348,True,"Modern chemical engineering is able to produce a huge variety of substances at a remarkably low cost (esp. when compared to labor  involved in *using* said chemicals). 


But some things are just *really* expensive. 

- Kalrez (FFKM) Elastomer: FKM is pretty cheap (though not compared to nitrile rubber), but FFKM is incredibly expensive, to the tune of hundreds of USD for moderate-sized O-rings. What's driving this? General nastiness of fluorine chemistry plus trying to fluorinate something much more complicated than PTFE?

- PEEK plastic. So useful -- yet so expensive. My googling tells me that nobody really knows -- or that it might be a manufacturing monopoly (in which case, why?)

- Polyphenyl Ether (used in diffusion pumps). Hundreds of dollars for 100cc. Possibly the synthesis is related to that of PEEK?

- Edit: Machinable glass-mica ceramic such as Macor. I know that it's fluorine-heavy but that doesn't seem like a full explanation.

So I had to come up with a reaction scheme for a chalcone, starting only with benzene. I used the Gattermann reaction to form the benzaldehyde that would be used in the chalcone, as well as the benzaldehyde shown in the synthesis of the ketone. My main question is about after I reduced the di-aldehyde to a dimethyl benzene. Once I acylated it I had the ketone I needed to make the chalcone. But how likely is that ketone to acylate again like a runaway Friedle Krats alkylation? Every substituent is directing to the least sterically hindered meta position of the ketone. But I don't know how much that ketone is deactivating the ring. So, how viable is this scheme if it were to be put in practice? Would I most likely have a double acylated compound, or was I correct that this would be a viable scheme?"

What are my prospects for an entry level position in Medicinal Chemistry in Boston/Cambridge?,6,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1487455216,True,"Hi r/chemistry, bit worried about my identity coming through in this, so throwaway time.

For background, I'm a 3.5 BSc chem major (higher in major) from a a decent state school. Took every ochem course (including graduate) course possible as well as some upper level analytical chem courses, but due to some timing issues - I couldn't fit in biochemistry or chemical biology.

I have set my mind on creating plastic models/things/stuff. The models needs to be stiff and withstand some tension, think base for a lever(sort of).

[The second candidate](http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-cheap-strong-castable-SULPHO-PLASTIC/?ALLSTEPS) uses sulfur and aluminium foil. 

I am obviously not a chemist. Therefore my impression is that the first candidates is safe wheras the second sounds like a bomb. The second candidate 'seems' stronger, again from an uneducated's point of view.

[Named Reaction #5]: Fischer Indole Synthesis,10,27,False,False,False,chemistry,1487688076,True,"**What is it?** The Fischer indole synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces the aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. It gets its name because it was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer. [General transformation here](http://www.synarchive.com/images/reactionsPNG/RX00020.png)

**Why should you care?** Antimigraine drugs of the triptan class are often synthesized by this method. [Indometacin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin), or indomethacin, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It is partially formed via this synthesis.

**What does the mechanism look like?** [Very Detailed](http://cdn.name-reaction.com/assets/_reaction_images/_png/fischer-indole-synthesis-m-cc87c6531234cc6962f2f60e6b63be10.png) or [Simpler version](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Fischer_indole_synthesis.png/700px-Fischer_indole_synthesis.png). It is believe, the reaction of a (substituted) phenylhydrazine with a carbonyl (aldehyde or ketone) initially forms a phenylhydrazone which isomerizes to the respective enamine (or 'ene-hydrazine'). After protonation, a cyclic [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement occurs producing an imine. The resulting imine forms a cyclic aminoacetal (or aminal), which under acid catalysis eliminates NH3, resulting in the energetically favorable aromatic indole. Isotopic labelling studies show that the aryl nitrogen (N1) of the starting phenylhydrazine is incorporated into the resulting indole.

**What else is cool?** [The Buchwald group](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja981045r) made a modification, via a palladium-catalyzed reaction, the Fischer indole synthesis can be effected by cross coupling aryl bromides and hydrazones. This result supports the previously proposed intermediacy as hydrazone intermediates in the classical Fischer indole synthesis. These N-arylhydrazones undergo exchange with other ketones, expanding the scope of this method. [Schematic for clarity.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Fischer_Indole_Buchwald_Modification_Scheme.png/1280px-Fischer_Indole_Buchwald_Modification_Scheme.png)

NMR Help - MOF Chemistry and linker ratios,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1487688930,True,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently digesting my MOF in D2SO4 (100uL) and making up to 1mL using DMSO-d6. Theres been mention that intergration under such acidic conditions (given that its 100% wt D2SO4) is not reliable. I cant find anything at the moment to back this up. The problem is, i have two components in my MOF, the linker and an organic compound bound to a cluster. I want to create a solution that is 1:1 ratio of these compounds but the problem is for every 20mg of linker i would require around 1uL of the other organic compound which could introduce an error. This is to prove that the acidic conditions dont affect the integration. I've done the prep using a micropipette as acurate as i can and i get a 1:1.5 ratio. It's been mentioned to create a concentrated stock solution of the organic compound and then dilute it down, this makes no sense to me and would be a waste of deuturated solvent. Can anyone possibly advise me if they know that the intergration is unaffected at such acidic conditions or if they know of a better way to run a sample with a ratio of 1:1

Thanks

Any help with emulsion polymerization?,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1487695240,True,"Howdy folks, I'm using a porous membrane [system](http://www.spg-techno.co.jp/english/contents/spg_membrane.shtml) to disperse monomer into an aqueous phase containing surfactants. I'm trying to make monodisperse polymer beads in the 5-10 micron range and I'm getting good success with the emulsion step but the polymerization step is producing a lot of fine particulates.

If you're not familiar with [emulsion polymerization,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion_polymerization) it uses surfactants to control the size of droplets in the dispersed organic phase which are then polymerized in a second step through the addition of a radical initiator.

During the emulsion formation I get very uniform size distributions that are also very monodisperse but as soon as I add my radical initiator I start to see the slow but steady growth of fine particulates. Here's an [image](http://imgur.com/a/rmky8) that illustrates my dilema. The black trace is the size distribution of my emulsion and ideally what the size distribution of my polymerized monomer should look like. Instead, after I add a radical initiator, I get the red trace. The fine particulates build up over time and the distribution gets a little bit more broad.

Any advice is appreciated!

Glovebox catalyst,5,9,False,False,False,chemistry,1487713601,True,"Excuse the throwaway reddit but I don't want this mess associated with me :)

So one of the other PhD students in our lab made a mistake, they were regenerating the glovebox catalyst (ours is detached for regen so not like the (fancy) mbraun systems). 

Once he was done regenerating the cat (ours is copper based), he took off the H/Ar flow and prepared to vac it down to remove the water. 

Here is where the fuck up happened. 

He hadn't switched on the vacuum pump... Opened the catalyst valve to the line, obviously sucked some air in. Still didn't notice the pump wasn't on, we away and when he came back to check it, he noticed it was a bit quiet... So he put it back on the H/Ar mixture but fucked  that up because he was panicking, so he manged to suck back some air/water from the outlet back into the catalyst at 300 C...

We tried regenerating again and it just hasn't really rescued the situation like we thought it should. We are holding at around 40 ppm oxygen... 

We were discussing and the best we came up with was, if the regen process is optimised for a sub oxide of copper, formally Cu4O or something like that, our heating mantle might not go high enough to fix it if he has made it all CuO... Other option being that our cat was on the way out anyway, but it was only 2 years old so that seems unlikely, unless the users of that box are really not nice to it - I use another one so I don't know.

So the question, has anyone done this before? Is it a case of more regeneration or has he fundamentally fucked it? "

How does the reaction of an alcohol and a vinyl ether work?,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1487717726,True,"What exactly is the mechanism for this reaction (which is the prestep fro a claisen rearrangement).

http://imgur.com/EFETKk2

my initial thought was the the xylenol is both, solvent and base, and deprotonates the alcohole which then acts as a nucleophile, substituting the methanol which leaves the compound as a alcoholate.

what concerns me is that a) methanolate is not a good leaving group at all and b) xylenol is not a strong base and i doubt that it is strong enough to deprotonate significant amounts of alcohole.

my second thought was that the ether gets protonated which would enable methanole as a pretty good leaving group. the alcohole would then act as a nucleophile, displacing the methanole from the ether.

but from where should the initial protons come? there is no acid stated, and xylenol is still a base, although a weak one.

so, does anyone of you have an idea how this mechanism could work?

Column chromatography & TLC on highly polar compounds?,10,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1487728642,True,"Ive been trying to get more proficient with columns by exploring different solvent systems and troubleshooting ""how do I purify ___ when nobody has published it before."" I made a new compound with a few pyridine rings in it so it is fairly polar. I ran a TLC in about 5% dcm/meoh and saw two spots, one at the baseline and one in the middle. both were kind of faintish, so I just ran another tlc plate in straight methanol and I saw something eluted, streaking to the solvent front leaving little to nothing behind at the baseline (not sure if thats the best way to describe this phenomenon), shown in this image. 

http://imgur.com/a/N2ZLX

I figured that is my product, as I would imagine a general thing is that you tend to make more polar molecules than your starting material. Both tlc plates were not concentrated well so I couldn't really tell what had more by intensity under uv lamp, howver it *seemed* like the methanol did, but I'm not sure if thats indicative of anything seeing how it is so polar


Without getting into too much detail about my product and starting material,  is it honestly possible something can only elute in straight methanol with a few pyridine rings on the molecule? to me that sounds crazy. "
IR Question: Is it possible for oxygen's resonance with an aromatic ring to appear similar to a carbonyl on a IR spectrum?,8,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1487730086,True,"I have a compound that I know for sure does not have a carbonyl: 2-methoxyphenol. However, on my IR spectrum I took of it, there is a peak at about 1760 that reaches down to about 60% transmittance. That's much less than what is expected for a carbonyl, but still noticable. My molecule has no groups that traditionally give peaks at that range. I have 2 hypotheses for this weird peak. Most likely, its just noise/an impurity. The other, seems like a stretch, and I don't even know if its possible, which is what I'm here to ask about.  

Since there is are two oxygens with lone pairs and is capable of resonating into an aromatic ring (they're ring activators), I'm thinking maybe the resonance hybrid of one or both of these oxygens into the ring makes ""almost carbonyl bonds"" (for lack of a better word). They would be in that range if they were actual carbonyl bonds. Also, because the oxygens are bonded to the aromatic ring, and either a hydrogen or methyl group, I would assume the dipole between the oxygen and ""carbonyl"" carbon would be weaker, resulting in a less intensive peak, which is what I have. So maybe that explains my anomalous peak.    
  

  
The first idea of just being noise and/or a contaminant seems much more likely. But it got me thinking, and based on what I know so far about IR, resonating into looking kind of like carbonyls seems slightly possible. However, resonance tends to weaken bonds, causing their IR peaks to occur at lower wave numbers. So it's likely that if the resonance hybrid even was picked up in an IR reading, it'd show at a much lower value. Or maybe not I really don't know. Am I completely wrong, or is my idea seem reasonable and possible? Thanks.

I'm almost done with my linear algebra class, so I saw a lot of parallels. The class didn't cover the math of the symmetry stuff, so I've just been doing some research on my own. But now I have some questions. There is a very real possibility the answers to my questions will be way over my head, or just extremely complex. But if I can at least get any general/simplified answers to point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate that.  
 

I immediately saw a relationship between symmetry operations and transformation matrices, and  thought symmetry operations could be represented as transformation matrices. I did some googling, and I found that yes they can be represented as matrices. For example, a C2 transformation can be represented by the 3x3 matrix ( I used the syntax to make a table so it's easier to read, that's why the top row is bold):   
 
-1 |0  |0 |
---------|----------|----------
 0| -1 | 0
 0|0  |1   
   
I've also seen representations with unit circle(unit sphere?) values/spherical coordinates, and those representations make sense to me as well. Anyway, this makes sense for transforming a single vector. I would like to know how he molecule is represented for this transformation to act on it. I'm assuming that the transformation can be represented as the function Ax=b. I could be wrong. My assumption is that either each part of the molecule is treated as a vector and transformed by matrix individually. Or that all parts of the molecule are column vectors of a matrix (say C) and the equation is AC=B. Both give the same result, I just don't know how its done conventionally. Also, if the molecules constituents can be represented as a vector, what are it's entries? Also once the transformation matrix is applied (again if it can be applied) what does the solution vector/matrix b/B look like? I'm assuming it's used in character table entry derivation.  Also, I could be way off in my interpretation. Group theory seems pretty daunting, and I've never had exposure to it until I started doing reading on my own. So I could be very wrong already.  
   
Second, can anyone ELI5 (or ELI am someone who rode the struggle bus hard through quantum mechanics in physical chemistry) symmetry adapted linear combinations? I've read the book and googled, but I just don't understand it. I understand you find the symmetry of the atomic orbitals of constituent atoms in a molecule. But after that, I just don't understand. There's psi set equal to coefficients multiplying wave functions of various orbitals, and they're added together. I don't understand what information is supposed to be interpreted from that linear combination. Like for ammonia, I'm supposed to extrapolate that there's degeneracy from its SALC. I don't understand how.  So if anyone can explain it, or show me where to look for explanations, I'd really appreciate it.   
  
Thanks for any answers or info you can give I appreciate it.

One of the key components of this system is the concentration of NaCl. The authors then suggest that the DLVO theory could explain the dimerization.

Does this theory explain the stability of small aggregates, like 2 particles interacting with each other and not others? I thought that once the attraction force is greater than the repulsion force, aggregation is inevitable.

The authors said the yield was ~60%. With single particles and some groups with more than 2 also present.

They also showed that adding more NaCl can favor major aggregation, while lower will not form dimers.

What I don't understand is that the TPA is listed as a co-reactant, but it seems more like a catalyst since the ruthenium atoms are still photo-active in the wells before the read buffer is added. 

From what I understand, the TPA is just catalyzing the redox reaction and helping to amplify the signal. However, I have seen the TPA listed as a co-reactant when looking into the reaction. 

So, I was wondering which is it actually considered to be?"

Nalgene Precise-Volume Dispensers: Out of Production with No Alternatives?,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1487866876,True,"Hey Guys,

So, we've been utilizing these precise-volume dispensers for several years now, for quick dispensing on qualitative testing:

https://www.coleparmer.com/i/thermo-scientific-nalgene-3700-0001-precise-volume-dispenser-1ml-6-cs/0787860

They're finally starting to give out, and as you can see, it looks like they're completely discontinued. 

I think our manager is hesitant to move to a more typical dispensing pump, since they're kinda pricey and we're stocking a more fast-paced, corrosive, industrial lab in which a cheap plastic dispensing bottle would likely work better.

Anyone out there know of any alternatives that function similarly? Or perhaps a more rugged dispensing pump in the 1-5mL range that won't break the ban if we have to replace them with any frequency?

Ether peroxides in the absence of oxygen?,11,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1487871022,True,"While bored, I was re-reading some of the ""how not to do it"" and ""things I won't work with"" sections on Derek Lowe's ""In the Pipeline"" blog. A few of which concerned the formation of ether peroxides in old cans of diethyl ether. It occurred to me that there seems to be much more fear of these than there really should be.

If you come across an old bottle or can which has already been opened at some unknown time in the past, then the apprehension is entirely justified. You don't know the history of it - whether the lid has always been screwed on properly, how much air has gotten in and so on.

However, if it's a can or bottle (or a bottle surrounded by vermiculite inside a can) which has clearly **never** been opened, then why should you be worried about that? As I understand it, for ether peroxides to form requires both ether *and oxygen*. Therefore air actually has to get into the container of ether in order to form ether peroxides.

If the container has not been opened and is still sealed, then surely there can't be any ether peroxides in there. Am I missing something here? Can ether form peroxides all by itself, in the absence of oxygen? If so, then how?

Another related question: Both diethyl ether hydroperoxide and the polymeric (or oligomeric) diethyl ether peroxide are liquids, presumably themselves soluble in ether. The peroxide formed from di-isopropyl ether may be a solid. But surely the often quoted crystal formation in diethyl ether is a bit of a myth?"

I want to throttle a colleague right now. DO NOT FILL PRESSURE VESSELS MORE THAN HALF WAY FULL. This is how explosions happen.,56,81,False,False,False,chemistry,1487899292,True,"First off, no one was hurt, thankfully. 

A colleague of mine set up a reaction in a thick walled pressure vessel. He filled it up to the very top with solvent, turned the heat on and left for a doctor's appointment. As should be predicted by everyone, that shit exploded. Glass everywhere, chemicals everywhere, oil bath everywhere. 

There were many errors that led to this easily preventable accident.

1) Never fill a pressure vessel more than half way full of solvent
2) Never leave a reaction until you know the heat is stable
3) Always put a blast shield in front of a reaction under pressure or put your hood sash down
4) Do not use a sealed pressure vessel, filled to the top with solvent, for a reaction that generates gas 
5) Always make sure you know what pressure and temperature a vessel is rated to.

Somebody could have been seriously hurt. 

Remember kids, there are no accidents in the lab, only things that could have been prevented with proper safety measures.

Typically, it's in the morning when we show up for work. But when it happens during the day my labmates and I obviously have to stop working and leave the lab. We’ve contacted EHS about this issue and they say that it is a Facilities issue. Facilities says that the air handlers shut off when the air gets too cold in order to keep a coil from freezing. No idea why someone thought it was a good idea to install an air handling system that isn’t capable of functioning in the environment of the Midwest…

Facilities doesn’t seem to think that this is a huge issue, but in 2017 alone, we have called to have the fume hoods turned back on 12 times. Some of the times it takes hours for the hoods to be turned back on. At this point we don’t really know who to make aware of the situation so that the problem gets fixed instead of waiting for a mechanic to turn the hoods on again. This seems like an issue that the university should be jumping to fix so that they can provide a safe working environment, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.

I suspect ion suppression for two reasons. The results from triplicate injections are not consistent. I could run one sample and get a wide coefficient of variance, and another where it's relatively small, which matches ion suppression as it is often an inconsistent problem. 

The second reason is my internal standard. I am using atenolol which which almost certainly has an ionized amide functionality which probably stays ionized in the LC solvent (0.1% FA). This would help alleviate ionization problems in the ESI needle I think, and triplicate injections show much better precision (~5% for IS, compared to 15-20% for the analyte).

Does anyone have any suggestions for alleviating suppression by altering the MS conditions? Maybe increase in temperature or gas flow to blow off the TFA more effectively? Thanks for any ideas."
How to find msds/patents on highlighter markers?,1,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1488083202,True,"Hey all,


I have a question about finding information on highlighter dyes.

"Urushiol and water. Solubility, separation, backcountry filtering.",2,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1488225891,True,"Greeting r/chemistry!

I have searched the internet for a few days looking for some insight into a simple question: Can I get [urushiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urushiol) (poison oak/ivy/sumac) poisoning by ingesting creek/lake water that has been exposed to plants carrying urushiol? And if so, how can I properly separate the oil from the water?

A bit of backstory.

My dad, a chemistry teacher, once got poison oak rashes on every square inch of his body. We had been backpacking in an area THICK with poison oak (PO) and he recalls seeing PO leaves/branches dragging in the stream we drank from. We treated the water with a typical pump-style filtration system. He's convinced he ingested the urushiol oils and says it's the only explanation for his complete exposure. I also drank the same water and had no reaction, but I am highly allergic and have been exposed many times.

I have since been petrified of hiking in PO rich areas for more than a day because of this water+urshiol question. I live in California and have resorted to simply backpacking only in the Sierra Nevada (hurray high elevation!).

I read through some chemical lab guidelines for dealing with urshiol samples and it suggested using coffee filters to remove from a host liquid of water. Could I simply pre-filter my drinking water with a coffee filter?

Can anyone explain or provide some literature references to help me understand the chemistry behind the interaction and basic chemistry between urushiol and water? "
Machining Oil removal before Metal Plating,7,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1488227036,True,"Hello! I have a steel piece that is hollow and is bent for its specific use. Diameter is about 1/4 of an inch. When they machine this product the manufacturer is using some type of oil in the process, and in warmer temperatures they tend to use more. Whenever I go to plate this product, the oil that is inside of the hollow piece will bubble out at some point causing problems with plating around that area. The parts are submerged in a 190F Base bath for cleaning initially, but it doesn't seem to push out any oil that is upside of the of the hollow steel piece maybe because of the bends. I am asking for helping in determining solution to help remove the oil before hand. Something to soak the pieces in before starting the whole plating process. Trying to avoid solvents because of the extra headaches like storage, flammability, fumes, safety, etc. Any ideas?

I was able to determine which protons were what peaks for the protons bonded to carbon. When I looked up the nmr of acetaminophen, they had determined which peaks corresponded to the amine and phenol protons. And yes, they were using the same solvent and amount of megahertz as my sample. Now I know these exchangeable protons are tricky, and some tests you can do involve adding D2O after an initial scan. I unfortunately do not have the option to add D2O and retest.  
 

I know phenol CAN BE between ~4.5-7ppm and CAN have a wide peak. So seeing it identified way up at 9 as a thin peak seemed weird. And as for amines, I have no idea what to look for.  Is there any systematic approach to saying ""hmm this anomalous peak is probably this amine/alcohol/whatever""? Because I was going to attribute the amine and phenol peaks to impurities, but I've found that is incorrect. My previous years' textbooks never covered this, and it hasn't been explained in class. I'd appreciate any help or links that could help.

Book That Covers High School Chemistry Well,6,13,False,False,False,chemistry,1488232131,True,"I do online school and the lessons are horrible.

Currently I'm working on a project, the assay is almost set up, I have found a way to do sample cleanup before injection but problem happens when I flush the column with organic solvent after all my runs. I'm using a Phenomenex Gemini C6 phenyl column 2um 3x100mm and I seemed to have destroyed it? The backpressure whenever I run it is pretty high. When I meant high, its like 3000psi. Unfortunately for me, I'm working with an old HPLC which operates in low pressure gradient, so anything above 2000psi, it will stop. Frankly I'm not used to it because I have always worked with UHPLC-MS.

All was well until I started washing the column. My method is an isocratic flow of 0.28ml/min. Mobile phase is 10mM ammonium acetate-ACN-MeOH in 50:30:20. Run time is about 20 mins each run. Initially while running the assay, the pressure was about 1120psi, however when I finish cleaning at the last step with 90% ACN, it started exhibiting high back pressure when I try to run with my mobile phase. Its like it got clogged.

Things I have done so far:

Remove column and check pressure- pressure is fine so points to the column
Remove guard column- pressure remains high so its not the guard.
Back flush column with 95% water, followed by 60% water, followed by 50% water with ACN- still high pressure.
Backflush with 1% acetic acid followed by 0.05% THF.
Back flush with 100% isopropanol- pressure dropped a bit but still high. 
Now I am currently backflushing with 100% ACN at 0.22ml/min and pressure is at 1586psi. I wanted to try methylene chloride but its too viscous."

The course covers the major topics of medicinal chemistry, including drug approval, common drug targets (enzymes and receptors), pharmacokinetics (half-life, clearance, volume of distribution), metabolism, lead discovery, and lead optimization.
As prerequisites, students should have a solid high school level foundation in general chemistry, biology, and math (logarithms and exponential functions). Students should also be able to identify organic functional groups and read line-angle structures.
While the prerequisites are modest, the course does explore deeper levels of med chem topics. Students who complete the course will be well equipped to listen to and follow a drug discovery talk presented at a conference or university.
The course also includes both weekly interviews with pharmaceutical professionals (many from Novartis, a partner on the course) and lab exercises highlighting online tools for drug discovery.

I want my REU experience to show me how I can maintain an interest in research while focusing on obtaining a job in industry. I don't know if I want to get a PhD or Master's after graduating, but I'd like the experience to hopefully put me in the best position possible whether I decide to attend graduate school immediately after graduation or later on.

This got me thinking about the + and - lobes on either side of the p orbital, and I think I have a misunderstanding because something isn't adding up. Are the + and - lobes different from spin? I had it in my head that the +1/2 electron would be in one lobe exclusively and the -1/2 would be in the other, but now I'm not sure if that's the case because that would mean that you would have lopsided atoms if any of the p orbitals aren't completely filled, which I don't believe to be the case. Can anyone clear this up for me? "

These two capacitors burned out last night in my chemical storeroom.  I suspect an EMI problem.  The Esser fire alarm system has been giving warnings, however this had been attributed to the frequent power cuts.
All capacitors have been removed from the storeroom and lab.  Flammable liquids are in an appropriate fire-resistant cabinet, chemicals are sorted by compatibility, MSDS sheets are on file, the room is well-ventilated, fire extinguishers are readily accessible and an egress plan is known to all staff.  Is there anything else I can do to be more safe?

Here is the full quote : 
After taking a brief search there are currently no pharmacopeia methods for this material, therefore each method on the COA would need to be developed and validated to meet cGMP standards for confirmatory testing.

 

Please see below for typical pricing for this type of method development and validation work:

 

Appearance = £870

Identification = £7,000

Assay = technique to be determined

Flash Point = £6,000

Boiling point = £6,000

Loss on Drying = £10,000

Residue on Ignition = £4,000

Heavy Metals = £12,500

Chromatographic purity(HPLC) = £16,000

 

Final pricing will depend on the nature and complexity of each method.  We’d be happy to have a teleconference to discuss in greater detail if you think that would be of use.

I've been trying to look for a selective assay that only targets hydrogen sulfide and not thiols. I know there's a number of fluorescent probes out there, but they are expensive or require some synthesis with poor yields. They're more of a last resort in this context because I do large volumes of assays, so relatively cheap would be great. I'm already using an assay to detect H2S in some chemical reactions (so non-biological), but am noticing garlic/skunk smells (which could be the release of mercaptans). My current assay doesn't differentiate between the two.

Other possibilities could be something that traps or preferentially removes H2S and assays the thiols instead (I'll just subtract the thiols concentration from my total).

I took AP chem in high school, so the first half of my chem class was review, but we have started to discuss VB Theory and hybridization. 

When looking at C2H4, C3H4, C3H4, and so forth, I came to an epiphany. Every C(odd-number)H4 molecule will be non planar, since the orientation of the sp2 orbitals on outer C atoms will be on different planes, since a C double bonded from both sides must use two different p orbitals. Obviously then, every C(even-numbered) will be planar, as the sp2 orbitals on outer C atoms will be on the same plane.

"Guys, I need some Chemistry soapmaking help",10,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1488512357,True,"I know this is such a basic problem compared to all the more science-y topics out here, so I apologize in advance.

Anyways, I was recently experimenting with creating a liquid soap. My formula used 10 parts tap water, 1 part SLES (sodium laureth sulfate), 1 part LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulfonate). I added some 50% NaOH (sodium hydroxide) solution to neutralize the LAS (can't say for sure that I neutralized it though) and added a little bit of CDEA (cocamide diethanolamine) and NaCl (industrial salt). 

So the process in order:

1) I mix half of the salt to the SLES first to make it soluble in water, slowly add the water to avoid clumping.

2) When that's done, I mix in the LAS and the NaOH solution. 

3) I then add some CDEA. 

4) Finally, I add the rest of the salt in aqueous solution to the mixture.

Somehow, my mixture ends up totally murky, with a milky/pearly and suspension-ish consistency. I expected the mixture to be clear at the end. So my goal is to make a clear (or at least transculent) mixture, and I'm not sure where I went wrong in my process. I hope someone out there points out my missteps and/or gives me a better process to do this.

Could it be the tap water containing precipitates and turning my soap like this? Or could it be that my order of mixing things is wrong? Or is it maybe that the chemicals could be defective (my dad had them stockpiled for over a year) or of another variant? Does my formulation lack something?

I should note that I don't use anything mechanical in mixing. Just using my own hands to mix, which is tiresome, but as they say, no pain, no gain. And this post was made almost a day after the mixture was made.

I am a chemical engineering student and perhaps a bit rusty on acid base chemistry, but a pKa specifically is referring to the species behaving as an acid, correct? So pKa1 would involve one of the amine functional groups losing a proton and pKa2 would involve loss of a second proton from the other amine group.

It doesn't make sense in that case that pKa2 would be lower than pKa1.  What am I missing? Are these pKa values referring to the fully protonated ""diammonium"" form with an extra proton on each amine? So that when both protons are lost, it is simply in its chargeless form?

Even then, it doesn't make sense that the compound would give away another proton at a lower pH."

There is a part that discusses a germanium isotope detector used by Philippe Hubert and these are the quotes from the book. (p. 242 - 243)

The hypersensitive crystal was capable of detecting the subtlest radioactive signals, while the inert lead blocked out the other particles that might be distracting.



I understand why they would want to use lead, but what would be the reasoning to using lead that is ""2,000 years old and from a Roman ship""?

Is there something in the *process* of manufacturing lead today that may place a higher background in the lead versus the process used to produce lead blocks thousands of years ago?

At the moment, a question puzzling me is why and how glass fibers (GF) degrade in water environment? The degradation of GF occurs, reducing strength of GF. As far as I know, the degradation occurs slower in seawater (containing ions) than in distilled water, which in my opinion indicates that process is related to dissociation of glass material. Do I understand correctly, that E-glass is slowly partly dissociating into ions in water environment, or is it ion-exchange or some other mechanism?

Another question interesting me is degradation of Carbon Fibres (CF) in oil environment. I heard, CF is inert in oil (does not degrade or swell), but I wonder, is it really true and to what extent?

"Why do many total synthesis publications appear to make the claim ""our target molecule has X **contiguous** stereocenters"" just because they can?",6,11,False,False,False,chemistry,1488736487,True,"It always felt like normal to me, but today I woke up with that question in my mind. Most sysnthesis papers that can claim that their target had X **contiguous** stereocenters in order to increase the ""value"" or ""difficulty"" of the route, they don't hesitate to do so.

In principle, in most stereoselective total synthesis, you introduce the first element of chirality early on the synthetic route, and then take advantage of it to build up the rest of the skeleton diastereoselectively. For this purpose, in principle this diastereoselectivity is usually easier to control the closer the stereocenters are, so having to build contiguous stereocenters should, in general, help, right? In addition, there are a shit-ton of synthetic methodologies allowing to install contiguous stereocenters (e.g. Sharpless, asymmetric hydrogenation...), but extremelly few for constructing stereocenters far appart from each other.

Obviously if you plan to install new stereocenters later in the synthesis in a reagent-controlled fashion, opposing substrate-control could be a problem, but in general this is not very common.

It is true that in some cases, contiguous stereocenters can be a pain to install correctly (e.g. [from 3 to 11 and then to 13 on Baran's Maoecrystal](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.6b06623)), so in those cases the claim would be right. But I feel like in most cases it would be way way more challenging to build a structure in which stereocenters are far away from each other than if they are closer together.

tl;dr - Does having all the stereocenters in a target molecule in a contiguous manner actually make its synthesis  generally more challenging?

What do you think?"

What are the most important skills needed for undergrad and grad level chemistry?,1,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1488863848,True,"Hello I am actually not a chemistry major but a freshmen physics/mathematics(pure) major that is curious about how to go about learning chemistry properly. My question is how did you go about learning chemistry when this field is way less generalized than say math or physics? Also what skills whether problem solving (theoretical) or lab skills are most critical to understanding chemistry and how would I developed those skills. The areas of chemistry that interest me are thermochem, p chem, orgo, 
inorganic,solid state, electro,chemical kinetics or anything else that sounds interesting. Also any books or articles that sound interesting send my way (reading pauling general chemistry right now)

How can I think more in terms of chemistry?,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1488865312,True,"High school student here. I'm currently taking a online course in Honors Chemistry -- and it is *terrible*. I'm mostly relying on other online sources like Khan Academy and Chemguide, but I feel I'm relying too much on memorization. I can memorize individual chemical facts and reactions covered in my course, which is more than enough to complete the quizzes and exams. Also, I can learn the concepts so that they make sense. But I absolutely fail when I'm asked to extrapolate what I know into a different situation, such as apply concepts or derive new information.

I feel like I'm being spoon-fed from the Internet with easy to access info on any chemical reaction ever, and while I can conceptually understand most things, I stop there. There's no general application of what I have learned, even in my course.

I'll give an example. In my course today, a question asked was ""Given two different polymer structures, and what you know of intermolecular forces, which is the high density polymer and which is the low density polymer?""

In hindsight, and after some googling, it is obvious that London dispersion forces cause the linear polymer to be more compact and thus denser than the branched polymer. I did guess correctly in the first place, but without a full understanding of what actually goes on, only based on a hunch.

My course seems to assume I can figure all this stuff out, and answers rhetorical questions without explaining the thought process behind them. (Example: ""You can see that x molecule will be a gas at room temperature, and..."")

I can continue along my current trajectory, and complete the course pretty easily. But my education feels incomplete -- I may study chemistry in the future, and I foresee myself being lost when it comes to solving actual problems, and not just slightly different variations of the same problem.

In math, I can easily learn the number system and derive whatever I need just from things I already know. Minimal memorization. But in chem, I'm unable to figure out basic properties and compositions of molecules that I haven't seen before.

I suppose my question is twofold. 

1. What is actually expected in a standard HS chemistry course in terms of problem solving? Is my course way behind in that regard? What should I expect to know, to be able to do? 

2. Are there any resources that will help bring my education up to standard? Problem sets? Something that will show how a chemist's thought process works?

Thanks for any help, and sorry about the wall of text. I want to enjoy chem, but I'm really struggling with the application."

"Enthalpy, useful work, and Gibbs energy",3,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1488874690,True,"Hey

I have a few specific questions pertaining to enthalpy and Gibbs free energy.

**1)** Most texts I've read reach the conclusion that ΔH = q under the assumptions that a) pressure is constant and b) the only work performed by the system is expansion work. I am pretty sure I can follow the reasoning:

H = E + PV = q + w + PV
and
ΔH = ΔE + Δ(PV) = q + w Δ(PV)

Constant pressure is assumed, so

ΔH = q + w + pΔV

It is assumed that the only work exerted by the system is expansion work, so

ΔH = q -pΔV + pΔV

The sign is because work performed by the system is an output.

Thus,

ΔH = q

Now, my professer arrived at a different expression (and was altogether pretty rough in his explanation). He concluded that

ΔH = q + w'

where w' denotes useful work (or so I assume; my professer used a Danish word with the same meaning).

He largely left the above expressions out, and instead introduced w as

[formula](http://i.imgur.com/NJ5flVw.png)

(this is the same as -w = ΔPV, right?)

Again, I assume the sign is due to the work being performed by the system, not on the system. 

Then constant pressure is assumed, and then w' (useful work) is defined

-w' = pΔV

... or expansion work like above, I assume.

Then he concludes that ΔH = q + w'.

So **why** does work persist as a part of the expression? Shouldn't it cancel out with the original pΔV like in the other texts I've read?

**2)** So, useful work. I ran into it in 1), and when I look it/Gibbs energy up, the gist seems to be that a) useful work is the amount of non-expansion work performed by a system (which isn't consistent with the expressions in 1); my professor seems to define useful work w' as expansion work (i.e. pΔV) - how to make sense of this?) and b) Gibbs energy is the maximum value of useful work a system can perform.

So what exactly is useful work? Is it a part of the enthalpy definition in addition to being something that Gibbs energy describes?

**3)** I have a hard time understanding changes in Gibbs free energy intuitively. I understand that the sign of ΔG indicates the spontaneity/non-spontaneity of a process (and I've run into some pretty hand-wavey explanations of G itself that kind of make sense). If ΔG is negative for a chemical process, e.g. respiration/the combustion of glucose, -ΔG is the maximum amount of useful work it is possible to extract from the process (creating ATP for instance), yes? But **why** does the increase of entropy in the system influence the amount of maximum work exerted on the surroundings (ΔG = ΔH - TΔS)? I can't get it to make sense intuitively.

Any help is appreciated. My native language isn't English, so if there are any physics/chemistry terms that don't make sense, let me know."
Why chemistry? Any advice?,8,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1488875736,True,"I've been in school for a while and switched my major to chemistry many years ago. Since then I've been failing terribly, due to laziness and complete lack of interest for the first half, then personal problems that forced me to take a break from school, and lead me to start over at another school (a long and complicated tale). Yet, I'm still in the same spot. Retaking general, organic, physical, analytical chemistry this semester. Back to square one.

Because it's been so long and I've basically forgot everything, I feel the need to really understand the material in depth in order to continue, instead of memorizing formulas and just getting by. I assume most in this subreddit are somewhat passionate and really understand the concepts. I guess the obvious answer is just sit my ass down and study most of the day, every day.

Just out of curiosity, how many of you guys are actually passionate about chemistry? What is it about chemistry that intrigues you?

I'm at a school where the coursework is overly rigorous and not very efficient. I once had an interest but I think those days are long gone and it has been dreadful recently. Due to policy at my school, I can't change majors and it's going to be a long ride. I basically have been a degenerate after high school, I want to be at least somewhat interested again, and maybe sharing some of your stories or experiences as a chemistry major would be enjoyable.

I'm not a genius (obviously) but not the dumbest person either. Just lack the motivation. Getting off topic, but please share your journey with chemistry.

APCI Mass Spec Protonation Question,4,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1488878318,True,"Hi all,

I’m assuming me must have some analytical chemists on here who can help me out with this one. I’ve recently started using APCI mass spec for the first time at work and I’m trying to get my head around which molecules will protonate using this ionisation method and which won’t. What’s the best way of establishing whether or not a compound will protonate? For instance, is there roughly a minimum proton affinity a compound must have in order to protonate? (I realise there are other affecting factors).

It would seem some of my assumptions about which molecules would ionise by this method are not correct. For instance I assumed aldehydes would protonate, however in practice they don’t actually seem to. And yet ketones will protonate very readily.

Any tips?

Who is responsible and what happens when an accident occurs while in an university lab?,5,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1488989383,True,"I don't live in US, so I'm asking to see what is the practice when accidents happens inside a chemical lab, especially if it causes damage to the person.

In my country and in my university there is a committee who is responsible for preventing accidents. We are trained at the very first start of our graduate program (it is mandatory, but only on the first week and never again). It actually does a good job explaining the risks associated with our work, first treatment, put out principles of fire etc. And the committee promote talks and workshops sometimes.

But there is no legal relation between the university and the student in respect to laws protecting workers, because we are students and not workers.

My country has a very specific law for workers and a different set of laws for public servers (people that work directly to the government, I don't know if it is different in other countries).

These are both groups of workers that have laws protecting them against the risks associated with their work. There are some differences, though.

Today I was having my first lecture of this class and the professor was talking about the history of safety laws and he emphasized that the laws our country has are valid for the relation employer/employee. Which isn't valid for us.

So his conclusions were that we should use PPE but we are't obligated to. We should follow the guidelines that were made by committee, but we don't *have* to. In practice, each lab is responsible for its own safety and there is no incentive to be more strict with it. Nor disincentive to stop being unsafe.

When I asked what happens when an accident occur he just shrug his shoulder saying that would be bad for me... 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

So I understood that my university is a little bit negligent because nothing really bad happened yet, but it is not prepared for *when* it occurs. My guess is that when someone get really hurt, the case will go to trial and the jury and judge will decide who is responsible and give the proper punishment.

How about you? How reliable is the safety in your workplace? What happens if someone don't use an PPE or if they don't label their chemicals properly? I think I want to push this into my university. And you shouldn't have to have losses to start thinking about this kind of stuff."

the best PCM material for a difficult situation,6,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1489104801,True,"Im currently in the middle of a project which involves cooling fish for fish vendors in rural parts of India. I plan to design a product that utilised PCM materials in an enclosed insulated space to cool these fish, out in the open for several hours a day. The idea would be that I would freeze these materials over night, so they could be used for the duration of the day to help cool the fish. However I have a number of constraints:

1.The PCM needs to have a high melting point, able to withstand temperatures of 20-30 degrees Celsius for hours on end.

2.The PCM needs to be fairly cheap, as the target market are not exactly money'd up, and despite paying on a lease basis, the most cost effective PCM would be probably ideal

3.The PCM or packaging rather needs to be fairly durable for rough handling and rural environments.

4. The PCM needs to be widely accessible and easily replenished by said company.

5. If possible, the PCM also needs to be food friendly so rather organic and not majorly harmful if it comes into contact with produce.


If you have the answer as to which PCM is ideal that would be amazing, however some sources and knowledge to look at will also be massively appreciated,

thanks.

Media preparation/equlibrium modeling problem,0,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1489110415,True,"First time posting here, would greatly appreciate any help!
I'm a grad student at UC Irvine, and have run into a problem in preparing nutrient media for the cells I am growing. 

I need iron-replete growth media and would like to know roughly how much exists as free Ferric ion, I use Mineql+, a chemical equilibrium and speciation modeling program which tells you how much of your reactants will exist as particular species (all possible species based on the pH, temperature, ionic corrections, and built in thermodynamic database)

No matter how much iron I add, Mineql calculates that, at equlibrium, nearly all will exist as precipitant (hematite, cobalt ferrite, etc.)

Should/can I exclude solid precipitation from the mass balance (I can tell Mineql to ignore these) assuming it takes hundreds of years for them to precipitate? 

For context, its just seawater (natural or artificial), with trace amounts of metals (total additions below 10 nanomolar)

Determing relative size of pectin (polygalacturonic acid) chains?,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1489119417,True,"Hi all, I'm working on a pectin experiment and the pectins we have are all very non uniform. I have a theory that one of our pectin is conposed of smaller weight (or shorter chain) Polygalacturonic acid (PGA)  chains but I am not sure how I would test this.

My first thought is to try and run some sort of electrophoresis of the pectins and then stain the gel with ruthenium red which will stain only the pectin, but I'm really not sure if that would work at all, I will have to try it. 

Is there a better way I could try to compare the realative chain lengths? I was also thinking of trying to incubate equal weight samples and incubating with pectin lyase at different time intervals, then seeing which solution travels further up a capillary tube after a certain amount of time to characterize the viscosity and determine which solution will contain the smallest chain composition, but since there's no way to normalize to the same molar concentration of PGA I feel like this method would be less informative.

Liquid-Liquid Extraction Issues,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1489119805,True,"I am trying to figure out if using a series of Liquid-Liquid extractions would make sense to get rid of an impurity.

Compound A has a solubility of 0.24 g/L in Hexane and a solubility of 0.004 g/L in water. It is in a concentration of about 1000 ppm and I need to push Compound A into the aqueous phase until there is no more than about 5 ppb remaining in the hexane.

How many times would I need to perform the Liquid-liquid extraction to accomplish this feat? I came up with a number around 8000 if I am extracting with equal parts hexane : water each time! This seems like it might not be feasible.

Normally, for this compound that gets a +1 charge at pH of about 1 I would adjust the pH with some HCl to help polarize the molecule and keep it in the aqueous phase longer. However, I do not want to attack the pi bonds associated with the cyclohexene that is in solution as well. Can I protect this alkene? Can I adjust the pH slightly without altering the cyclohexene?

MASc vs MSc for polymers?,13,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1489151949,True,"Hey guys, I was just looking for some feedback on which path might be the best one to go down, based on industry jobs. 

I am an undergraduate in chemistry, graduating this April and starting a master's program in the fall. I have applied to both MSc and MASc (Masters of Applied Sciences)programs in polymer chemistry, but while MSc programs focus more on polymer synthesis and chemistry practices regarding specialty polymers for biomedical, the MASc programs Im looking at tend to focus more on either polymer functionalization and processing of nanocomposites (contaning more commodity-like polymers) through engineering practices. The MASc programs would be interdisciplinary while the MSc programs would be straight-up chemistry, maybe a bit of biology mixed in. Which isn't a con for MSc but a factor to take into account. I like both options but here is my dilemma:

I have heard and seen that jobs are limited for only chemists in industry (at least in Canada) and it might be beneficial to diversify via MASc to get a leg up. Especially when it comes to materials chemistry. That being said, my education so far is in chemistry and I am afraid that choosing a MASc might make me appear as weaker in chemistry (although I would obviously still retain my chem skills and work in between chem eng and chem). An MSc would make me appear stronger in chemistry, but I am afraid it would box me into only chem jobs, in terms of industry jobs. And at that point, it might be more beneficial to finish a PhD.

Let me know what you think, good or bad, I would really appreciate the help, from one chemist to another :)"

A free, seven-week [course on medicinal chemistry](https://www.edx.org/course/medicinal-chemistry-molecular-basis-drug-davidsonx-d001x-2) starts on Monday, March 13th on the edX platform. The course covers the major topics of medicinal chemistry, including drug approval, common drug targets (enzymes and receptors), pharmacokinetics (half-life, clearance, volume of distribution), metabolism, lead discovery, and lead optimization. 

As prerequisites, students should have a solid high school level foundation in general chemistry, biology, and math (logarithms and exponential functions). Students should also be able to identify organic functional groups and read line-angle structures. While the prerequisites are modest, the course does explore deeper levels of med chem topics. Students who complete the course will be well equipped to listen to and follow a drug discovery talk presented at a conference or university. 

The course also includes both weekly interviews with pharmaceutical professionals (many from Novartis, a partner on the course) and lab exercises highlighting online tools for drug discovery. Please take a look or tell a friend.

Spring: O Chem II, Bio II and Stats

Chemistry was not my strong point in school so I thought I was ask here if there might be some sort of chemical test that I could use?

Also, what sort of spectrometry or assaying type service would I employ to tell me the concentrations of lithium carbonate in my soil/rock samples? I've asked the oilfield labs around here, which are the only somewhat local chemistry labs around, and no one seems to be able to tell me what I need exactly.

I'd love to buy a handheld XRF but they are crazy expensive. Is there anything cheaper? I see handheld Raman spectrometers for first responders in disaster zones that are more affordable (used) but I also can't find Raman spectra for lithium carbonate and unsure wether it would work for my applications.

Customize your ChemDraw toolbars and resize them for high DPI screens,25,97,False,False,False,chemistry,1489367651,True,"I don't know that this is very well known so I thought I'd create a post here...

As is mentioned in ChemDraw's user manual, each toolbar is defined in a .xml file (essentially a simple text file) and by editing these .xml files, you can customize every toolbar pretty much any way you want, including adding/deleting/moving buttons, using custom icons, changing the size of the buttons. etc. You can also create new ones. For example, I use ChemDraw every day but 90% of the time I use a limited set of tools, so I created one single toolbar that has all the tools I use most often (see attached image, showing two standard ChemDraw toolbars and my custom toolbar in the middle). This way, not only is it more efficient as all the tools are on the same toolbar, but I can also hide all other toolbars to have more canvas space.

Also, as is shown in the image, in these .xml you can change the size of the buttons (I've made mine slightly larger than those on the usual toolbars). As an aside, you can use this trick to increase the size of the toolbars if you are trying to run ChemDraw on a high DPI monitor and find that the toolbars are absurdly small.

In any case, maybe some of you will be interested. Let me know if you have any questions! (I'm using ChemDraw 2014).

**Edit:**

For those with a PC (I don't know how it works on Mac, but it should be very similar) who want to try the custom toolbar shown in the image, and who want help in creating one of their own, here is a DropBox link to a zip file containing the necessary files and some short instructions in a Word file. Just extract the main folder from the zip file anywhere on your computer, then look at the instructions in the Word file. The process of installing the custom toolbar is very simple, but it may look a bit more complex just because I included instructions to backup your files before you use my custom files. Note that the instructions were written for ChemOffice 2014, and that you may have to slightly change the folder paths in the Word file if you use a different version of ChemOffice.

I'm used to looking for procedures for all sorts of reactions on Reaxys. Now I'm often doing modifications (f.x. attaching stuff to the N-terminal or to a cysteine) that *should* work like normal organic synthesis, but often I need to adjust the solvent, temperatures etc.

I feel like every time I try a new reaction I have to invent the wheel again. Because I know this has been done before, it's just hard to find the resources. I have a post-doc in the group that helps me out with things he has done before, but if I'm working on something new, I only have WOS/google to rely on.

What I'm doing is often quite trivial, and maybe for a seasoned peptide chemist it's absurd to want resources for it, but I've already run into problems because I'm choosing the wrong solvent or using a reagent that's known not to work, because I simply can't find the old articles where people figured it out.

What is Homogenization/Steeping in E-Liquids?,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1489453242,True,"Hi! There is a lot of bizarre contradictions in the vaping community about how to make an DIY E-liquid tasty and good (we called it alchemy and maybe there's an irony about it). So, in theory, the point is to homogenize VG, PG, nicotine (optional) and a flavor solved in PG. This is supposed to take time sitting at room temperature, from days to weeks, even months: why is that? What is going on inside these bottles?

My hipothesis, considering the sources I've consulted, is that time and room temperature create the needed motion/energy inside the bottle in order to homogenize the flavor accross the liquid. So that's why some people put them in warm water in order to accelerate the process. But some other people say that's not good because the flavor last less and it ""degrades""/""oxidizes"" nicotine.

I don't know what to think at this point: there is a lot of irrational thinking from each side, probably because of the fact they don't know about Chemistry and, sometimes, maybe even placebo effect is involved (just another hipothesis).

Small-scale safe smoke production,3,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1489456818,True,"The fan hood over the stove in my apartment isn't working. It still makes noise and you can feel air coming out of the outlet, but it's not sucking in air from the intake vent over the stove.

When cooking, steam and smoke clearly visibly ignore the intake vent and just rise straight up and pool along the ceiling. The fan totally fails to perturb the gas.

I filed a maintenance ticket with the apartment complex, but they closed it as ""working-as-intended"" since air is coming out of the outlet (I don't know where that air is coming from, but it's not the proper intake vent).

To get this problem fixed, I need to produce a demonstration for the maintenance technician featuring visible smoke failing to be sucked into the intake vent.

Some ideas I had and then dashed:

* Cooking a meal and boiling water are out, as I don't know exactly when the technician will arrive and I can't have him waiting minutes for me to demonstrate the problem.

* Commercial fog machines are out because they produce far too much vapor for the demonstration.

* Burning something is out because open flames are prohibited in the apartment complex.


I need a safe, inexpensive reaction that will produce a noticeable but modest amount of smoke at the drop of a hat and won't create a huge mess. Bonus points if I can pause and resume the reaction.

I was attending a laboratory tradeshow forum recently and overheard conversation about how there was a report issued by OSHA in 1990 that made the claim where laboratory personnel have a lifespan 10 years less than the average, and the lack of proper fume hood containment was the direct cause.  I did some research online but besides a few snippets on certain websites that briefly mention this, the original report or an official statement was nowhere to be found.

Is there anyone also aware of or interested in this piece of information and know whether an original source exists? I have a feeling this was the basis for ASHRAE to make the tracer gas threshold more strict, as it used to be 0.5ppm in 1985, and since the 1990 report came out, it was tightened to 0.05ppm in the 1995 revision.

EDIT 1: Thank you everyone for the interesting replies and insights! I guess OSHA ""hid"" the report from existence and circulation because there were claims that they had actuarial figures (too sensitive perhaps, who would ever pursue a degree in Chemistry or Chem E anymore :p), which ultimately drove them to draft and pass the ""Laboratory Standard"" in 1990."

First up is it acceptable to take LOQ as 3*LOD? I've seen a lot of conflicting methods for determining the values. I don't have a linear range that includes a blank value for some methods so I've used SD of the lowest value for LOD but unsure if this is correct. 
When using a calibration curve with a 0<m <1 slope (m) I ended up with an LOQ below the LOD which I know isn't possible/doesn't make sense.

That leads on the sensitivity, it's my next area to educate myself about but could anyone give a rough idea of a minimum curve slope or what factors affect whether it is acceptable/significant. The linear range has turned out to be shorter than expected and I've no chance to do more calibration calculations within the range so I'm working with a rather small data set.

Next up is there a statistical way to determine linear range or is it visual/removing values above and below a section before comparing R^2 values? I have no external data to compare to but it is 99% likely to be a linear correlation.

Also is there any point utilising polynomial trend lines? It seems counterintuitive to just edit your equation to fit the data points (it's a novel analytical technique so the calibrations aren't amazing). I am expecting a linear range at some point but a colleague suggested using quadratic equations to get a better fit.

Tldr: 

* LOD/LOQ

* Sensitivity

* Linear Range

* Polynomial Regression/Trend Lines

Cyanuric acid reduction through melamine,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1489556115,True,"Hey r/chemistry I had a question for those that may be interested in helping a novice get a fuller understanding of why this may be a bad idea.

In the pool industry it's extremely common to use isocyanurates to ""stabilize"" your chlorine from photolysis, whether it's granular or tablets. Overtime in the water what tends to happen is cyanuric acid (in either 3 of its analogs,not sure if I'm using the right terms.) builds up in water and stops chlorine for being able to oxidize/sanitize efficiently. Usually it's been common practice to replace water, draining and refilling. Recently a new product came to market that is what I understand to be a microbe. It has a biofilm that protects it from the low levels of chlorine, and breaks down the cyanuric acid in to ammonia And water? I'm not certain.

Possible tangent aside, my question for you guys is there any foreseeable reason melamine isn't added into the water so to form an insoluble percipate that can be removed from the water? Is there potential interactions I'm not seeing between common pool chemicals?

1) http://www.ymdb.ca/spectra/nmr_one_d/5041 this one shows 3 distinct hydrogen peaks
2) http://www.ymdb.ca/spectra/nmr_one_d/2718  this one I have no idea whats going on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaoU1CWGt_8&feature=youtu.be

Something quite interesting happened today during the work-up of a reaction. While washing the reaction mixture using DCM and water, a brown emulsion formed. Reaction mixture was a dark red. After letting it sit for a good hour the emulsion remained, so I decided to assume it was part of the organic layer and separate. While dripping the emulsion into the organic layer I noticed that the solution was constantly moving. I stopped and watched it and eventually it slowed down to a stop. After dripping in more of the emulsion, it began moving in the same way and stopped eventually. And again for a third time, so I'm doubtful of it being caused by air currents. 

Any thoughts?


And for those interested the reaction was:
Phloroglucinol, 6-chlorohexanol with potassium carbonate in DMF along with heat.

When my professor got into lab she told me brine could be used to clean up that nasty organic layer, which cut through the emulsion immediately! No more psychedelic dripping after this, which made to rest of the work-up as normal as every other one... "

This is what I'm worried about; I want to qualify for chemical engineering jobs but I think at this point I won't be able to. I'll have the proper education, but because they didn't have the specific program, I won't qualify. 

I've looked up chemE jobs, and noticed they usually ask for a chemistry related degree / chemical engineering degree etc. I just want to know if you guys think it's a good idea for me to minor in mechanical engineering and get my B.S. in chemistry  or should I study a combination of something else?

"Why can't beta-hydride elimination occur in vinyl, or alkenyl, metal complexes?",8,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1489831680,True,"I understand that for beta-hydride elimination to occur, we must have:

In metal cross-coupling reactions, we are told that it's best for the halide part RX not to have any beta-H on sp3 carbon, in order to avoid beta-hydride elimination. That's why the R of RX should be either benzyl, phenyl or vinyl. Why can't beta-hydride elimination occur in vinyl (for phenyl it is easy to see why as you would form benzyne)?

I feel as though this next step to a PhD is just something I have been expected to do rather than something I really want to do. 

Has anyone felt this? I just want some advice on what to do. Thank you



EDIT: I seriously cannot believe the supportive and utterly heartfelt advice thrown about. I really appreciate everything and I think i have decided to take a year off and think about what it really is that I want. Thank you all so much."
Questions about saccharide nomenclature,3,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1489951937,True,"I'm currently writing up my thesis all about characterising saccharide molecules. I've managed to really confuse myself where their names are concerned and hope someone on here can help, I need to know the exact structures I'm dealing with so I can accurately assign spectral features and compare them.

So, I got a load of sugars from Sigma Aldrich, namely D-(+)-glucose, D-(+)-mannose, D-(-)-fructose, sucrose, D-(+)-maltose monohydrate, D-sorbitol and myo-inositol. I've used the sugars primarily in solution, does this mean they are all in their ring form?

The way Sigma has named them is different to what I've learned, I understand D but is (+) and (-) interchangeable with alpha and beta? 

Also, the image for D-(-)-fructose they use on the website is the 6-membered pyran, not the 5-membered furan ring. I understand it can exist in either but surely the furan is more likely to be the one I've got from them?

Thanks for reading, hopefully you can help me out!

Graduate with a PhD in organic this year. I have no drive for anything left and don't know what to do. Any thoughts are appreciated.,141,251,False,False,False,chemistry,1490077328,True,"Throw away because I don't want this tied to my main account since I am easily found and have posted here too many times.

I am set to graduate with a PhD in synthetic organic this year. It looks to be about early summer or so. I'll probably start writing my thesis soon. Up to this point, I've more or less been successful. I've gone to conferences to give talks. I've got a bunch of research done and can write a good thesis on it (granted, the research is lack-luster due to a lot of bad luck), I've won a few awards here and there. My adviser and committee are all rather proud of me. 

I am so done though. The past 6 years has *killed* me. My spirit died years ago. I stopped caring about my science years ago. I've been running on fumes for years. It's felt like a matter of survival. I shouldn't be sad, as I had a great set up with an amazingly supportive adviser who has bent over backwards to help me. It was never enough. I honestly don't think I was cut out for this but somehow managed to make it to the end out of lucky circumstance.

I decided research is NOT for me a long time ago. I find it to be soul crushing toil for almost no return. With graduation coming up, I have to start finding a job. Or rather, I should have looked months ago but I haven't. I'm just so dead. I'm so burnt out I honestly don't even want a job. Graduating doesn't feel like a prize. It feels like a check point that leads to more toil and suffering. It feels like everything coming after graduation is going to be down hill. I honestly can not think of a career that I want. Research is absolutely out. It looks like teaching is out too. I'm really good at teaching, but my adviser and others have given me very solid arguments to why I would hate it and it wouldn't be good to me. I recently started this internship things that deals with the business end of chemistry, and barely a week into it I absolutely *hate* it, and realize that this isn't the path I want either. It feels like I won't have any use with my degree. All of the paths lead to something I'd hate or not survive in.

To make matters worse, I have 100k+ loans from undergrad, so I need a well paying job to stay afloat. Honestly, at this point I feel like I'd be happy as a peach just working at the front desk of a hotel or something. No more stress, no more toil. Just something I can go in, work with some people in a happy environment, and go home at the end of the day and recharge. But that doesn't make enough money. I feel so backed into a corner. I haven't done any work for a solid month or more and have just faked it because I have been able to get away with it. I feel terribly guilty about it and it's causing it to not be relaxing, but I am so hopelessly burnt out and absolutely *dreading* the future that I have been unable to will myself to search for jobs, or put the bow on my research (which is 99.9% done). 

I know this sounds pathetic, but please help. I have wanted to be a chemist since I was a child, and I have done everything to make it to this point, and now that I am at the end I don't want to do anything but crawl in a hole and either never come out, or just die. 

Note: Yes I have mental problems, I take medication, I see a therapist every week. None of that has been working or helping, because this stuff feels a lot larger than that all and I am just not able to cope with the impending real world.

This helps clear my head some is I at least have some direction. I've also gained some prospective on how I need to deal with myself. Basically try and take an *actual* break, not this fake-break that doesn't recharge me that I have been trying. In addition I need to try and learn (and relearn) how to be positive. This is something I'm going to have to do with my therapist but at least I know it's a huge priority I need to deal with. If I don't the job search is going to be drudgery, and I can not afford to have it be like that.

Thank you all so much. I'm going to keep following things here.

I didn't really understand or retain too many concepts in chemistry, and I feel like the courses at my school were not structured into trying to ingrain the chemistry in your head (both quarters of PChem were math based where you could just follow the proof or the word problem, Quantum is very math based, and so was Analytical). 

I wouldn't be able to tell you anything past the surface level of what an electron does, where it is, why it exists, or why it's important, and god forbid you ask me anything about biochemistry or organic chem (I got Bs in just those classes). I still don't understand how to push electrons or make resonance structures, but I was able to get through the weak Organic Chem curriculum at my school (it was verbatim memorizing reactions and then changing the outer group).

Idk, I feel like I'm too cowardice to move forward in chemistry, because I really did like it, and I love to learn what I was able to learn (I know how to use all the machines from analytical chem and I would be able to tell you how to use each one and why those work), but my chem theory is pretty weak.

I've been thinking about switching majors for a while, because I found that I liked applied chemistry (that is, applying chemistry to another subject area such as biology) over just normal chemistry. I find it fascinating when a professor relates something in my general chemistry class to a biological system. He means to use it as an example, but to me it just resonates on another level. However, I was wondering what the differences between the two majors were before I completely switched to Biochemistry. I know the classes I would end up taking would be a little, but not too much, different (I think I'd only be missing 1 Analytical class, 1 Quantitative class and about a year of Inorganic). But what about job prospects? Can you get the same job with a Biochemistry degree that you can with a Chemistry degree?

Trying to Find Meaning in Working in Chemistry,8,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1490140414,True,"This is similar to a few other posts I've seen recently, but I'm having some troubling finding any real motivation to keep working hard in chemistry.

I am currently a 5th year grad student, PhD track. All in all, I probably have one more year until things are wrapped up and my thesis is done.

Here's the trouble I'm having: After 8 years of doing research, going to conferences, seminars, and the like, meeting people, working for different people... I find very little motivating about work. Note, I said work, not chemistry. Chemistry is really cool, and I love learning about new spectroscopic techniques and synthetic methods, etc., but the people and the atmosphere...

I'm not going to pretend I've had a smooth 5 years. I transferred labs at one point because of a number of unproductive months of work, stemming in part because I couldn't stand being around my coworkers and looked for excuses to not be there. Stemming in part because of declining health of close family members.

Even my current position is just sort of grinding along. More family health issues plus an overall lack of a support system. I recognize that professionally, that's horrible. I'm essentially digging my own grave, but whenever I try to sit down and think about what drove me, what inspired me, to be able to harness that again... I only get more frustrated with the system in which I find myself looking at spending the next 30-40 years working.

A few instances of things that make me dislike this field of work:

(1) The majority of chemists don't seem to care about the idea of working as a 'team.' I get that in many institutions, that's on purpose, which I also consider to be a horrific approach to science, but mine is one where students and labs collaborate with considerable frequency. That said, the 'team' aspect is missing from the top down. The PI's are more interested in being the 'boss' and publishing than in be a galvanizing force for the group. This to the point that when they are approached about their handling of, say, meetings, they reply with things like 'it's not my job to do that...' when all that is being asked of them is to do something as simple as make sure they're including the larger group of the lab in discussions about chemistry with individuals presenting work, considering that we're all, ya know, sitting in the room for the 1-2 hours the meeting is going on. They highlight that certain problems are just par for the course, and that in industry or academia, results are all that matter when it comes to keeping your career. While I understand that point, I am also sickened by the thought that that makes certain behavior acceptable. That viewpoint pretends that chemists are, on average, treated well in the work force by employers or, heck, even other chemists, which is absolutely not the case. It's frustrating that even newly tenured PI's simply stick to this system, rather than maybe slowly trying to improve the atmosphere and conditions of our line of work. 

(2) The majority of successful people in the field are generally hard to handle. You can call it ego. You can call it pride. Maybe you simply think many are socially awkward, but once again, we've normalized such behavior. It's fine if your PI demands you work overnight to collect time points, or pits you against your coworkers for the right to claim something for your thesis or a publication. It's fine to demand that students work 60-80 hours a week. Heck, many of them define their lives almost solely by their career in chemistry. They're fine with that being the only thing of note that they tried or accomplished. There is a rather popular Nobel Prize winning professor that likes to describe himself by saying, ""Kinetically, I'm an asshole. Thermodynamically, I'm a nice guy."" Clever, but still highlights the problematic attitude that most seem to have.

(3) The overwhelming majority of chemists I've met, worked for, worked with, etc. aren't even motivated by a love of chemistry or a curiosity for the material. They're driven by stress, anxiety, deadlines, fear of being fired, fear of their project being defunded, etc. I mean, every couple of years there's a new study on rates of depression, anxiety, and other stress related disorders among science grad students. National labs are even more cut-throat, and in industry, I mean, the work of chemists is often the very reason many of those companies are considered Fortune 500's today, and yet, R&D is one of the most expendable positions to work in. It was once described to me by someone in a rather large company that the best way to go about things was to try and work for the most prestigious company you can as quickly as you can. That way, when you do get fired, you can more easily obtain a comparable position, salary, and benefits elsewhere. I mean, what kind of bullshit is that?

I guess in all of those points, one of the biggest problems I have with the field of work is that no one seems interested in challenging the status quo. It's fine to kill yourself for chemistry. It's fine to be expendable. It's fine to treat your coworkers like crap. As long as you churn out the work your superiors want to see, nothing else matters. What is the point in that?

Granted, I have met the occasional chemist who breaks those rules, but they are outliers in my experience, and that's just terrifying to me.

I want to get over the personal nonsense I've had to deal with in the past 5 years, finish strong, and go on to have a promising future... But, I just don't see a way to simultaneously let my love for chemistry take priority, and have the terrible people, social disorders, and marginalization take a back seat.


So, now, my question directed to all of you is, quite simply, what positive force motivates you? How do you challenge the current, crummy order of things, and overcome it? "

This excited me at first - being a naive first year grad student I didn't know any better. Fast forward a year, we've submitted our first manuscript. My PI thought we had an outside shot at JACS, but submitted to Org. Lett. feeling very confident in acceptance for publication. Org. Lett. was a unanimous rejection. So we submitted to JOC, and 2 of 4 reviewers feel our work is not a significant advance, and will consider a resubmission after extensive revision. They even said to consider publication in Tet. Lett. I find myself agreeing with the editors in this case. I realize some reviewers can just be a pain, but it seems like my PI's view of our work is so out of touch with the reviewer/editor consensus.  This just frustrates me, especially with 2 years to go in my PhD program, and it feels like there is nothing I can do except mentally roll my eyes when the PI oversells his research.

Organic Chemistry vs. Material Science Engineering,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1490165329,True,"Hi,

I'm a third year undergraduate and I'm currently experiencing my college life decisions crisis. I'm a double major in both Material Science Engineering and Chemistry. However recently, the warring engineering and chemistry staff (graduate students) have been encouraging me to drop one or the other. My grades are fine and I'm surviving the double major. I can also complete both degrees in a total of 5 years (I'm on my third and I'll be done with chemistry next semester). Yet I'm still told that I should drop one.

I understand that the last degree that you get is the only one that matters, so while my dual degree looks nice right now, once I go to graduate school the degree that I choose to pursue there will be the one that all future employers look at. However, I feel like having the dual degree still benefits me. I love organic chemistry, it's my passion, but I worry about prospective jobs in the future (and the fact that I need a PhD to get a decent job -since I don't plan to go into academia-). That's why I thought the Material Science Engineering degree would be useful. And I know, why not Chemical Engineering? The answer is, I'm not super into process chemistry. I want to create innovative new compounds or materials, not just take a compound and improve the process for large scale distribution. Material science has the chemistry aspect that I like (and there is such a thing as organic materials) and I wont be as limited  as maybe a chemical engineer would be.

Recently, the pressure from both sides of my degree has been laying so heavily on my conscience that I've been considering dropping one or the other. I feel like, and correct me if I'm wrong, that I would be doing myself a disservice my not maintaining both degrees. I like both of the majors so far and I don't have to go that far out of my way to get both so why not? 

Any opinions would be great. I honestly just want to know if I'm wasting my time. the people that I am currently talking to are biased to their own field of study, which I understand, but it makes my decision less simple. I'm completely capable of deciding on my own, I would just like more information on prospective job outlooks and realistically which of the two majors is more viable or if a dual major is actually a good thing. 

Sincerely,

A struggling college student"
What does the octane number numerically represent?,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1490173675,True,"I understand that Octane numbers are a measure of the knocking in the engine. However, I would like to know how octane number is calculated and the exact factors that affect it."
H7PN4 (Imidophosphoric acid triamide) as a strong base in aqueous solution?,5,8,False,False,False,chemistry,1490183571,True,"Firstly, please forgive my lack of chemistry knowledge, I'm still in middle school and just happen to have an interest in chemistry (particularly organic chemistry)

So, strong acids (e.g. sulfuric acid, perchloric acid) are pretty common in chemistry and they can dissolve in water to form strongly acidic solutions, but when it comes to bases, it's pretty much just group 1 metal hydroxides for strong bases. Stronger ones like alkoxides and hydrides will react with water to generate the conjugate acid and hydroxide

That then led me to think, since the strong acidity of sulfuric and perchloric acids are due to the resonance stabilisation of their conjugate bases, can the same be done for bases and their conjugate acids?

I drew a structure of what I thought would be a strong base (the compond in the title). After that molecule gets protonated, I would think that the P=N pi-bond would delocalize across the molecule and stabilize the cation.

I did a google search on this compound and found it's name and CAS number (14700-19-7), but wasn't able to find much more information on it.

So, 1. Is there anything wrong with my concepts of chemistry? and 2. Does anyone have any information on the properties of this compound (and any similar ones)?"

The definition of stereogenic center reads:
 ""Any point in a molecule, such that an interchanging of any two groups leads to a stereoisomer.""

I don´t really understand how that differs from chirality, since if you change two groups attached to a chiral center will generate a different stereoisomer. Could anyone give me a hand here?

Help Changing the curriculum: applied chemistry,0,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1490270836,True,"Hello everyone. I am currently helping in an “Applied Chemistry” Course for industrial engineering students (that already had two other more basic chemistry courses). Many of the professors are old and stubborn, but right now (for a number of reasons) is an excellent moment to add / change subjects of the course.

I’ve always felt that this course needs more of the “Applied” part. We currently teach 9 weeks (54 hs) of quite advanced thermodynamics (basics, thermochemistry, clasius-clapeyron relation in depth, equilibrium constant for all kind of reactions in depth, colligative properties). And then 7 weeks (42hs) of organic chemistry basics. I feel that the first part of the course, while hard on math and “easy” to evaluate, is of no use for an industrial engineer. At least not in the depth we teach it.

What are some more practical subjects you would recommend we look into, to add in the curriculum? As I am an industrial engineer myself (fond of chemistry nonetheless) I feel kind of lost to help my professors to improve this course. But I am also afraid that they lack the initiative.

Any suggestions will be really appreciated. Cheers!"

to Remove Odor from a Storage or Shipping Container

There's no telling what's been inside of a used shipping container.  It could be coming out of China with a load of palletized toys that were nicely wrapped in plastic; electronic components boxes and stacked from Taiwan; or a load of steaming fresh garbage out of some other nation.

To be frank, most people really don’t care and never think about how the inside of a shipping container smells; that is, unless they’re going to be converted into some type of storage container or portable office… and then it really matters.

If you have a shipping container that really stinks, here’s a tip from the professionals at OnSiteContainers.com.  In three easy steps you can rid your container of nearly any smell.

Step 1.  Go to your local Dollar General, or similar store and buy a large jug of cheap ground coffee.

Step 2.  Spread it evenly on the floor of your shipping container, and close the doors for 2 days.

Step 3.  Sweep up the coffee (and reuse if you have more than one container).  Your container now smells faintly of coffee.

Why is there a maximum reaction rate for reactions involving enzymes?,5,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1490317782,True,"I understand that there is a saturation point where substrates fill up all of the active sites of enzymes, such that an increase in [substrate] will not increase the reaction rate V, i.e. the reaction is zero-order wrt substrate.

However, let's consider a simple reaction pathway: X->Y+Z, with rate constant k.
Assuming only X is involved in the rate-determining step, the rate equation would be V=k[X], i.e. the order of reaction wrt to X is 1. It suggests that, as [X] increases indefinitely, V will increase indefinitely.

Going back to the enzymatic reaction, when the saturation point is reached, why can't an increase in [substrate] increase V? Even though all the active sites of all enzymes are filled such that no more enzyme-substrate complexes can be formed, why can't the substrates react with itself/themselves without the help of an enzyme, as if the enzyme wasn't there (albeit with a higher activation energy required)? Or is my concept of ""[X] increases indefinitely, V increases indefinitely too"" incorrect? Is there a limit?

By the way, in the reaction pathway of my second paragraph, I assumed X was involved in the rate-determining step. Is it even possible that X is NOT part of the rate-determining step? i.e. do I even need to assume that it is involved, or due to the way the reaction pathway is, X MUST be part of the rate-determining step?

I understand that H-O-H with Lewis Dot Structures on top of the oxygen atom would be correct and simple. 
I also understand that the hydrogen atoms are ~105° apart, and that the pos/neg polar bonds are what push them together along with other molecules to bond to make water, so it would be more correct to have a stucture that has H / O \ H (with the two hydrogens lower than the oxygen). And even more so if you put the δ+ with the H's and δ- with the O. 
I really, really love the aesthetics of hexagonal skeleton structures. Can't really associate that with oxidane, I'm just saying that they are the most appealing and eye catching to me. But at the same time, the simplicity of having a solid, horizontal H-O-H is oddly tempting...

This week I began learning how to perform simulations of light exciting molecules. I wanted to share with you one of my first simulations: excited water!

http://i.imgur.com/vwyvxNp.gifv

The gif shows the difference of electron density (current density - ground state density) around the water molecule as it is being hit by a short laser pulse at the resonant frequency of 10.5 eV. I still do not understand this system too well - so I focused in beauty rather than accuracy (for example, I do not know if the 5E-5 value I used for plotting the isosurfaces is reasonable at all, and I designed a very short pulse to have a quick simulation). The first half of the gif is the actual simulation, and then the gif is reversed just to make it flow continuously.

I have also plotted the HOMO and the LUMO in an attempt to reason what is going on above:

http://i.imgur.com/dJOuiJ9.png

I can clearly see the LUMO being populated during the resonance, but I do not understand why there seems to be an oscillation between the LUMO and what looks like a Pz orbital... Perhaps that is an inaccuracy, or I just haven't learned the underlying theory.

If anyone around here can help me resolve my doubts or give me some tips to improve, I'd love to hear it! I am also happy to answer any questions.

Homegrown peracetic acid,2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1490484905,True,"I'm using peracetic acid as my disinfectant for my indoor microgreens.  Because I'm not a chemist, I'd appreciate a double check on the final numbers because they do not reflect what others (laymen, admittedly) have said.

At a concentration of 0.390 mol/L, peracetic acid (PAA) acts as a sporicide after a 24-hour contact time ([Baldry, 1983](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6409877)).  I calculated the molar mass of PAA to be 76.035 g/mol, so I need (76.035 g/mol) * (0.390 mol/L) = 29.654 g/L of PAA to be effective.  Since the density of PAA is 1037.500 g/L, (29.654 g/L) / (1037.500 g/L) = 0.0286 = 2.86%. So of a 1 L solution, 2.86% must be PAA while the other 97.14% is water.

PAA is made with hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid.  Hydrogen peroxide is H2O2 while acetic acid is C2H4O2.  However, the chemical formula of PAA is C2H4O3, so H2O must be the byproduct.  Given that the hydrogen peroxide's molar mass is 34.015 g/mol and acetic acid's is 60.052 g/mol, I expect the resulting molar mass of PAA to be 94.067 g/mol, but since water is the byproduct, PAA's actual molar mass is 76.035 g/mol while the remaining 18.032 g/mol is water.  In other words, only 80.831% of the hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid solution becomes PAA.

The NIH notes that an equilibrium solution can reach levels of 40% PAA using 30% hydrogen peroxide and 40% acetic acid ([ref](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+@rel+79-21-0)).  In a 1 L solution, this corresponds to 300 mL hydrogen peroxide, 400 mL acetic acid, and 300 mL water, so that is 700 mL of reactant.  When the hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid react, I know that only 80.831% becomes PAA, so (700.000 mL) * 80.831% = 565.817 mL of PAA.  However, the NIH says that an equilibrium solution can only reach 40% PAA, so that 1 L solution garners only 400 mL of PAA.  That leaves 165.817 mL, or 29.316% of the initial acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide that did not react.  I don't know why these molecules are floating around in the water and not reacting, but I'll take NIH's word for it.

I am using white vinegar, which is 5% acetic acid, and food grade hydrogen peroxide, which is 35% hydrogen peroxide.  I will use the numbers from the previous paragraph: 400 mL acetic acid and 300 mL hydrogen peroxide.  To get 400 mL acetic acid, I need (400 mL) / 5% = 8 L vinegar.  To get 300 mL hydrogen peroxide, I need (300 mL) / 35% = 857.143 mL food grade hydrogen peroxide.  According to the NIH, this creates 400 mL PAA.  Remember that 2.86% PAA is sufficient for a 1 L PAA-water solution to act as a sporicide; that's 28.6 mL PAA.

Since I need only 28.6 mL PAA, 400 mL PAA is 13.986 times that amount, so I can simply scale the values down by 13.986.  To get 28.6 mL PAA, I need 8 L / 13.986 = 572.000 mL vinegar.  I also need (857.143 mL) / 13.986 = 61.286 mL food grade hydrogen peroxide.  To clarify, a 1 L solution containing 527.000 mL white vinegar, 61.286 mL food grade hydrogen peroxide, and 411.714 mL water results in a 2.86%, or 28.6 mL, concentration of PAA.  In raw numbers, this 1 L solution contains 26.350 mL acetic acid, 21.450 mL hydrogen peroxide, and 952.2 mL water.

These final numbers look reasonable for a 2.86% PAA concentration.  Remember that by mass, 80.831% of a pure hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid solution becomes PAA; the rest becomes water.  Also according to the NIH and my interpreted calculations, 29.316% of the initial acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide molecules do not react for some reason; that means 70.684% does react.  Double checking my final numbers, (26.560 mL acetic acid) + (21.450 mL hydrogen peroxide) = 48.01 mL potential PAA.  Since, according to the NIH, only 70.684% of the molecules react, (48.01 mL solution) * 70.684% = 33.935 mL solution.  Of the molecules that do react, 80.831%, by mass, become PAA while the rest become water, so (33.935 mL PAA) * 80.831% = 27.429 mL PAA.  This is close to my goal of 28.600 mL PAA; I assume roundoff error causes the 1.171 mL difference.

Non-academic sources from forums, blogs, websites, videos, et cetera have numbers all over the place.  The best authority I came across was a man who owned a microgreen business and mixed 50 mL white vinegar and 50 mL food grade hydrogen peroxide in 1.5 L.  His values are drastically different from mine, especially the white vinegar's.  It looks like people pull numbers out of thin air, and there isn't a consensus.  No one ever explains why they do what they do.

Some help would be appreciated.  Thanks for reading."

According to Clayden though, the opposite is true. [Clayden claims that cyclic acetals are more stable than acyclic ones.](http://imgur.com/XyWT3Zp) 

 I also managed to find the same example in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, but it was differently explained. It claimed that more substituted acetal carbons produced harder to hydrolyse acetals as shown [here](http://imgur.com/yBdGAWy). However, in this case, the dimethyl acetal was destroyed, while the dioxolane was spared, even though both acetal carbons were similarly substituted. 

Meanwhile, the tables provided at the back of the textbook (which the organic chemistry portal copies) seem to indicate that the dimethyl acetals are more stable in acid than dioxolanes.

I am also aware that entropy of mixing is also needed to find ΔS of the system/reaction, so that ΔSsys=ΔSrxn°+ΔSmix.

The change would only need to be binary, but it would also need to be continuous and reversible over an extended period of time.

I found [this paper](http://blogs.rsc.org/py/2013/02/18/paper-of-the-week-plastic-reusable-ph-indicator-strips/) in which a lab has produced something similar, but I have no idea what they are doing and how to prepare such a thing. Coming from an engineering background, I have little experience with chemistry. I previously thought of using a buffer with a certain pKa around the range of interest in combination with an indicator dye, but I don't know if that is reversible. Furthermore, this idea would be applied in the human body so I don't know if it would be biocompatible with all the chemicals and such.

If anyone is aware of such a material that can do such or how to approach this issue I would greatly appreciate the help! I'm sorry if it's such a dumb question to ask, I'm not too familiar with the chemistry behind pH indicators."

What is the correct formula to determine the ligand field stabilization energy of an octahedral metal complex?,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1490573784,True,"Currently, the notes I have from my professor disagree with notes from my textbook and I'm not sure which is correct. From my textbook the author claims that the formula is 

X(-0.4Δo) + Y(0.6Δo) + Zp while my lecturer claims the formula is 

X(0.4Δo) + Y(-0.6Δo) - Zp

where X is the number of electrons in the lower T2g orbitals and Y is the number of electrons in the higher energy Eg orbitals. Z is the number of electron pairs paired in an orbital compared to the number of electron pairs paired in an orbital in the free ion. P, spin pairing energy, is the energy required to overcome electronic repulsion between two electrons placed in the same orbital.
Δo is is the ligand field splitting parameter in octahedral complexes. 

For example the complex [Fe(NH3)6]2+ has an LFSE of 0.6Δo according to my professor's notes but an LFSE of -0.6Δo according to my textbook and other online sources I've consulted. So I'm wondering which is the correct value for LFSE and formula to use. because I can't find any authoritative sources or ask my professor unfortunately. Also is the octahedral splitting constant, Δo, the same for each complex or does it change depending on the complex? I provided a picture of my lecturer's notes and an online source below.

Solubility of silver iodide in dry THF? (And considerations during an acetylide alkylation),5,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1490639085,True,"Hello soon to be fellow chemists!

My primary question is if anyone knows how soluble silver iodide is in dry THF (probably with small amounts of DEE)? I've searched, but can't find the solubility for this particular solvent.

 

If you want to know the background for this question, and might have some tips for, or see any obvious flaws in, my planned synthesis, please read on.

 

For my undergraduate project (sorry if this is considered homework), I’m doing an acetylide alkylation (reactionsketch: http://imgur.com/a/0lg4G). I will start out with the alkyne pictured and do various self-chosen alkylations. I’m thinking of starting with iodomethane since this is the simplest reactant and available in the lab. I’ve also seen vinyl iodide and propargyl iodide in the lab, would these work in the same manner as electrophiles? I will hopefully make the acetylide by first adding the starting material in dry THF, followed by EtMgBr (I believe this comes dissolved in DEE) in a N2-atmosphere, and upon heating the acetylide should be generated at 60 degrees. I then cool the reaction to 0 degrees (to promote SN2) and add the iodomethane with a syringe. After some time (how long?), I’m thinking of splitting my reaction mixture into two mixtures, adding silver nitrate to one of them. If the reaction has worked, silver iodide would precipitate (if and only if silver iodide is NOT soluble in THF). This could also be used as a rough indication of reaction times, and if I’m not mistaken Ag+ could also aid the reaction by making iodide a better leaving group?"

"Not sure what's wrong with me, or how to move forward",22,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1490669862,True,"I was going to post this in the weekly careers/education thread, but there's a lot to it that I feel like would take up a massive wall of text and I think it might merit it's own post. Let me know if this isn't the case. 

Basically... I'm in a rut. I'm currently in my sophomore year of college (although I've been taking college courses full time for 3 years... actually in a university, mind, not AP courses) and I'm struggling really badly. I don't know what I should call it--  perhaps burnout? But basically, my mind isn't functioning like it used to, and it might ruin my life. 

I've been working in different chemistry labs since high school (starting with ochem prep assistant ---> synthesis undergrad research that went nowhere but still experience ---> internship in R&D with a pretty big role ----> my own quasi-project in an analytical chemistry subfield). I'm a good chemistry student (As and high Bs) and a pretty good everything else student, minus... physics. 

Physics is seriously sinking my GPA, to the point where I could lose my scholarship. I've never had to tackle a course like this before. I've never had trouble like this before. I passed the first class with a C, but I might legitimately fail this one. I've gone to tutors, office hours, you name it. I'm just not grasping it. It doesn't help that it takes me a long time to actually work out the problems (homework that takes most of the class maybe an hour takes me almost 4 hours at best), and our exams are less than an hour long (!). 

On top of that, I've been seriously struggling lately with some mental health issues. I developed pretty major depression last semester out of nowhere (although I've always dealt with anxiety and was familiar with mental health resources and therapy, but never have I ever needed it this much) and I started seeing a therapist once a week, on top of taking medication. But with all of my classes, plus research, plus dealing with a death in the family and some other minor health issues, I'm worn out. I'm even concerned that I'm not doing well in my other classes (analytical chem, diffeq) as I should because I just sort of freeze up sometimes. My mind is just exhausted. And I know, I sound like I'm making excuses, but I promise that I'm trying. I work. I study all weekend (if I'm not in the lab). Yet I'm still failing a class that freshmen thrive in and still spend any free time at all that I have sleeping or eating.

Possible solutions I've thought of: taking a break, going part time (if I can find financial aid to do that) and working part time, or just taking a break semester where I take easier classes. But if I lose my scholarship... talk about the most shameful thing that could ever happen to someone. All it would prove is that I never deserved to have it to begin with. And I'd be losing it by so little... a mere .02 at worst. And in that case... I don't know what I'd do. I don't usually think of suicide, but nobody has been able to give me an answer as to what I should do if I lose it. They just tell me not to lose it. But it's not that easy. I'm working so hard and it's not even paying off. Nothing is fulfilling anymore. I don't even like being in the lab as much as I used to because all I can think is ""what's the point, if I don't finish my degree I'll never work in a lab again"". 

Has anyone here graduated later than normal, lost a scholarship, anything? I don't want to feel like a lonely loser. I'm feeling so much intense self-hatred and I can't shake it. It's making me lose sight of what I love so much, which is chemistry. 

Also, if I might ask, are there jobs (even menial lab tech jobs) that hire people with an associates/associate level chemistry coursework? Especially if they have a lot of experience. Because my ideal situation would honestly be to take a break from school and work somewhere for a little while and come back, but I don't want to work 3 fast food jobs to get by or I'll never actually get a break. Thanks guys. "

I use Isopropyl Alcohol,8,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1490760555,True,"to wash the hairs out of my razor. I use it as lubricant and potential wound sterilizer but, why does it wash out my razor so damn well? (Tl;dr down there for those who've lost hope in reading this novel)

Is it an *insoluability* to the hairs much greater than water that forces them out better? No because I don't apply nearly as much isopropyl by volume and there certainly isn't the same force applied as a water tap.

Is it a matter of *solubility* then? Is the alcohol group maybe highly soluble with whatever makes up hairs (phospholipids?)? So it would dilute particles of hair until they were small enough to squeeze out of the razor blades? I don't know, I get pouring that party crashing alcohol and boom! The hairs are green light, go and gone. Can a solvent dissolve a solute that quickly?

Does it react to the hairs like an acid would and munch down on the hairs to the finesse of the grains of hair I see in the sink after? Gasp! The alcohol has an Oxygen willing to rid his hydrogen! Is that even possible in chemistry?? I don't know D:

**[TL;DR]** Why does isopropyl alcohol wash the hairs straight out of my razor with such grace? Is it a question of an solubility/insoluability property? An.. ^an ^acid? Thank you for your time."

I'm looking for laser-induced fluorescence transitions for OH using a tunable, pulsed ns-laser, a PMT with a bandpass filter from 275-375 nm and an obnoxious amount of baffling, and a Bunsen burner flame as the OH source. Apparently this was trivial enough that the guy in my group who used this methodology in the 80s only included a sentence about it in his thesis, but I'm not having much luck.

I've looked for the v=0-->v=0 transition around 308 nm, scanning over the entirety of the rotational structure (as predicted in HITRAN), and likewise have looked for the v=0-->v=1 transition around 282 nm (which I expect to be even more difficult).

Does anyone here have experience with this brand of LIF detection? Do you use lensing at all? What part of a cone flame (from a Bunsen burner) should have the highest OH concentration? Should the fluorescence signal be extremely distinct from the (10 ns) laser pulse in terms of timing? (I was expecting signal on the microsecond scale but I've yet to see any.)

Lyophilization of Isooctane Containing Solution,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1490829119,True,"Hello everyone,
I don't know if this is the right place to post but I am a currently working as a graduate student researcher and have a question about lyophilization. I'm somewhat unfamiliar with performing lyophilization of organic solvents and was wondering if this approach was right to determine the pressure to lyophilize isooctane from a sample. Using 35.1kJ/mol and a vapor pressure of 41 torr at 294.15K, I calculated the vapor pressure of isooctane to be 0.00060969168 torr or 0.000812855388 millibars at the triple point of 165.76K for isooctane(varies depending on decimal places used). So to achieve sublimation, I just have to make sure the vapor pressure in the lyophilization chamber is lower than that of isooctane right? 

Previously I was using a weaker pump that was only able to go down to around 0.053 millibars and so the sample would melt and boil instead of subliming. I am switching to a M16C Fisher pump which on the website show a pressure of 0.00053 millibars and hopefully should be successful. If I am incorrect in my approach, please feel free to correct me. "

How should a chemistry PhD student decide which conferences to attend and when?,25,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1490901750,True,"(My advisor doesn't really know - I am his most senior PhD student, and his experience from his PhD is inapplicable for this. Shall I be bothering students in my department and professors in my committee or may I (also) get some more general advice here?) 

What are some important factors to consider? Such as... Shall I attend just the conferences my advisor also attends? Shall I always attend the conference to which my research fits the most, even if it isn't attended by anyone else from my group and/or is expensive? Which level of (in)completeness of research is optimal to present? Is it better to give a talk at a student conference or present a poster at a main conference? Shall I present variations of most successful research or at each conference something completely new? Shall I save my whole travel budget for the final 1.5-2 years of PhD? Is the quantity or quality of conferences more important? Shall I expect to pay a notable amount for conferences out of my own pocket although I have a separate travel budget? Etc., I don't even know if I am asking the right questions.

In case this information helps, I have travel budget of 4250 USD for my whole PhD (my advisor may cover more if he'll have funding but I rather wouldn't burden him and not sure how safe it is to count on that, although my advisor generally is nice and good at getting grants), the cost to attend any one top-level conference my advisor prefers to attend is around 1800 USD; I can attend local conferences for around 0-200 USD each but they are likely to be of very little use to me; we don't have much experience with mid-level international conferences.

How is uni-level chemistry compared to Olympiad-level chem?,9,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1490903931,True,"I've been wondering about that for a while...

Strange but nice smell of electrical insulation.,2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1490936078,True,"So I recently obtained a bag of mains cable scraps from a building site, to strip for their copper content. Most of it is the normal grey or white flex, as is used for power or lighting ring mains. But one of the pieces is red, with a layer of aluminium shielding between the outer plastic insulation and the individually insulated live, neutral and earth wires inside. So I'm fairly sure this is a piece of fireproof (or fire resistant) cable. Anyway, while stripping this, I noticed a smell reminiscent of benzaldehyde.

I know it might not actually be benzaldehyde, since many other structurally related compounds have a similar smell - acetophenone, nitrobenzene, iodobenzene, benzonitrile to name a few. If the plastic was a nitrile polymer and had been thermally decomposed, then I suppose it might have been HCN. But the wire was not burnt in any way and the insulation was still flexible, so showed no signs of having been overheated.

The smell wasn't coming from the outer insulation, since I didn't notice it until after I started stripping this off. It came from the blue and brown insulation on the inner neutral and live wires. I've never heard of benzaldehyde or any similar smelling compound being used as a plasticizer for wiring insulation - I thought dialkyl phthalates were the usual suspects for that.

Anyway, I've never smelled anything remotely similar from any wiring insulation before. Most don't smell at all unless overheated or burned. So what's going on? What could be causing the smell?"

Getting strange results from Folin-Ciocalteu method for phenolics - anyone know why?,4,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1491086281,True,"I'm using the Folin-Ciocalteu method to determine phenol content in fruit juice samples.

Could need help on the explanation of the Acetaldehyde-Process,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1491089475,True,"So i've got an oral exam about acetic acid on monday.

I got all my info out of Ulmanns Encyclopedia and my professor criticized the reaction mechanism.

I am still trying to figure it out so maybe you can help me understanding it first and then i give you his comments on it.

So for those who dont know the acetaldehyde process is a radical reaction of acetaldehyde with oxygen to form acetic acid in the end.

Here is the mechanism: http://imgur.com/a/Vohzw

And now i will try to explain it as far as i understood it.

1. A initiator radical (Cl, Br or any other halogen radical) grabs the H of the acetaldehyde and leaves it with the radical character.

2. This acetaldehyde radical meets oxygen and binds it and the radical character moves to the one who is the farthest away of the molecular center. Is that the momoperacetate?

3. Now the monoperacetate meets another acetaldehyde and closes the chain reaction cycle.

4. The resulting R-OH one reacts with another acetaldehyde and forms this intermediate product (any guesses for the name?)

5. The O-O-R is migrated? and replaced by the H and forms a carbokation?

Actually i have to say that i dont really understand the intermediate steps of 5 and 6.

But what happens here in the end is that it decomposes into acetic acid and another acetaldehyde which can be reused. right?

6. By this hydride shift reaction we get a similar thing as on 5. and another carbokation. 

Finally it forms 2 acetic acid molecules.

Did i get it right at least a bit? Can you help me out with the steps i didnt quite understand?

So now for the comments of my professor.

He assumed that i did the last big mechanism piece myself and he suggested that the carbokations would be unneccessary.

In the next sentence he says that the hydride shift reaction wouldnt work as there are no carbokations.

Like what?

I mean the book explicitly says that it is one. Or is he just referring to the mechnaism that isnt quite complete? the book said that this would be a simplified mechanism as oxidation mechanisms are pretty complex.

Can you clarify that?

Also sorry if i didnt use correct terms. I am pretty good in english normally but i am not really used to english in combination with chemistry.

Help with PubChem,0,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1491116515,True,"Hi there,
I'm currently collecting data through PubChem for a set of drugs. Since I'm new to PubChem, I'm having a little trouble using it. There are a few drugs in my dataset that have the same name, but are developed by different manufacturers, so I assume that they also have different properties. Examples of such drugs in my dataset are:
oxycodone (formulated with abuse-deterrent naloxone, prolonged release tablet, pain), Mundipharma
oxycodone (formulated with abuse-deterrent naltrexone), Pain Therapeutics
and
morphine (inhaled, Premaire), Sheffield
morphine (oral SR, Multipor), Tanabe
However, when I search these on PubChem, I only get results for one drug, oxycodone. I’ve tried to search for potential alternate names for each of these drugs or anything that will help me differentiate them when I search for them on Pubchem, but I’m not able to find them. Since PubChem only gives me information about one drug, oxycodone, and I’m not able to find anything that differentiates these drugs (which were developed by different manufacturers), do I just assume that both drugs have the same properties/should I just look at the oxycodone page on PubChem?

Help choosing university degree,11,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1491125280,True,"I'll be posting this on r/physics aswell. That way i'll get answers from both sides of the argument

Alright so im in the second year of swedish Gymnasium (think it's like high school/college right?), studying natural sciences, which includes all of the base courses like chemistry, physics and biology. It's now about time for me to start looking for a university degree. Only issue is that i dont know which degree i should choose based on my interests, and none at school seems to be able to help me. This is why im asking here. 

What im interested in is material science. Making new solid materials with useful properties (especially unorganic compounds). But while i do like the process of synthesis and of understanding the technical use of materials, i'm mostly interested in the theoretical components behind it all. Understanding why something has a specific property, all the way down to the quantum level is what i like the most. 

So here's the dilemma. If I choose a material science degree, it seems to mostly be a surface overview, cutting out the deeper theoretical part that I love. 

If I choose chemistry then ill get a bit more of a deep overview, especially if I choose quantum chemistry. But won't I have to go through hours of organic (plastics are gun though) and biochemistry that i dont care much about? Also wont the focus be more on the practical synthesis part of chemistry? 

Now if I choose either of these, it seems as though ill get locked away from most quantum based courses later as they in sweden atleast seem to require a physics degree. but i really dont want to choose a degree in physics if i'll have to go through all those ours of classical mechanics that, while usefull, I dont find that fun, aswell as losing the chemical part that i like a lot. 

I would be really gratefull if i could get some tips on what i should choose and maybe even where (im open to studying abroad). It's an important decision and i don't want to screw it all up by choosing the wrong degree!"

I've come here for help because I don't think this is an entirely unique experience.

This isn't to say you don't need to know the fundamentals, of course, but I'm trying to find the point I can aim towards to keep me engaged until I get through.

Help me make this experiment with hemoglobin work.,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1491210325,True,"Dear redditors of r/chemistry (particularly those with a biochemical slant),

A few weeks ago, I asked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/5ymjzs/looking_for_a_spectacular_indicator_for_carbon/) about a method to visually indicate the presence of CO in the outgas of my reaction. I decided to give it a shot with hemoglobin, but I can't make it work - but I'm not sure whether it was doomed to fail from the start, or whether I am just getting something wrong.

So, it went like this: (1) I got hold of some bovine hemoglobin from Sigma and made a 2 wt% solution in water. Reasonably, it looks brown and nasty - just like dried blood from a steak left for to long in the fridge. Then, (2) I bubbled this solution with a 5000 ppm CO/Air mixture (which, granted, is not pure CO, but should be OK) and nothing happened - it just looked as brown and nasty as it did before.

Then I thought, ""okay, maybe the problem is that it is not oxygenated first"". So I tried bubbling the solution with pure oxygen first - but again, there was no visual change.

So... um, I'm guessing this is more complicated than I thought (probably from a biochemical point of view) - but I don't really know why. Is it the pH? Is it that the hemoglobin is denatured or irreversibly oxidized?

(then, to add insult to injury I tried the iodine pentoxide method - but it doesn't seem to work without heating, which is a problem for the demonstration).

Toxicity of a copper sulfate coating on steel?,8,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1491271650,True,"I'm a knifemaker, and recently found an old machinist recipe for ""coppering"" carbon steel.

You mix a solution of water, copper sulfate, and sulfuric acid, then coat the blade. You're left with a coating of copper that's a few thousandths thick.

For me, this could be a bit of artistic flair, but since most of my knives are users, (food, &c.) I worry about the toxicity of the chemicals, as both CuSO4 and H2SO4 are toxic. 

If I neutralized the acid and scrubbed the coating with soap and water, and left it overnight in mineral oil, would it make it any more safe? Or is it forever a no-no?"

Help with running Cyclic Voltammetry,15,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1491316136,True,"I've been trying to run CV on samples for the past two weeks and I kept running into issues with my results. I have since taken to run simply Ferrocene in dry DCM as a test, and while it looks good in the first few runs, if I leave it for 10 minutes and run the CV again, the signal loses any reversability - i.e. I see an oxidation to ferrocenium, but no reduction back to the neutral state.

The kicker? It seems to be only me! I've run CV succesfully in the past (last time was last summer), but now they just go to shit in little time. No one else in my lab is having this issue; some have run sweeps on samples with ferrocene for over an hour with no appreciable degradation of the signal. We use the same dry clean solvent, I've resublimed Ferrocene to be safe and my baseline looks clean as anyone else's. I also clean the cells similarly to other people, that is rince with solvent, dunk in dilute HNO3 overnight, then rince with plenty of DI water, acetone and DCM. I air-dry, then heat in the oven for at least several hours, ideally overnight.

As anyone else ever had this issue? Any ideas what could be causing this degradation of ferrocene's signal?"

How can I create a low surface tension xylene solution?,8,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1491338349,True,"I'm working on an art project that involves transferring printed images onto ceramic tiles. The basic process is: 1) print out the image using a laser printer 2) brush xylene onto the clean ceramic tile 3) place the printed side of the paper down onto the tile 4) rub the back of the paper so that the printed toner transfers to the tile 5) peel away the paper.

The problem I am running into is that the xylene has too much surface tension, and pools up on the ceramic tile. I would like to mix the xylene with a surfactant to help with this. My idea was to make a solution of xylene, dish soap, and water, or something like that. Before trying this, I thought it would be a good idea to check with some chemists to make sure that this is not going to create some dangerous toxic chemical or something. I am already working outside with a respirator, glasses, and gloves when handling the xylene.

Could you please help me with how to create a low surface tension xylene solution that is basically safe (at least not any more dangerous than xylene itself)? Thanks!"
We just built a pricing transparency search engine - it lets you see what others have paid for supplies,20,226,False,False,False,chemistry,1491338790,True,"Researchers are paying massively different amounts (3-5x) for the same products.

We noticed this problem while talking with purchasing departments, visiting labs and stockrooms, and having invoices emailed to us. Seeing this problem at scale inspired us to build a tool so you can check prices yourself. 

Since pricing is not transparent, it's difficult to know if you are getting a fair price. A lot of researchers email their sales rep., get 20% off from the list price, and place an order.

Labs with university contracts are also overpaying at the item level - some products have a great price while others are horrible. This is largely due to university contracts being based on a percent discount from list price and not on what a product actually costs. Our goal is to give you a tool to quickly check what prices are reasonable.

Incoming PhD Student With A Few Questions...,5,18,False,False,False,chemistry,1491405416,True,"Hello all!

I was recently accepted to a PhD program out in the midwest and have declared my focus to be in Analytical Chemistry. I chose analytical chemistry because of my ""extensive"" undergraduate studies in chemistry and biology and I was hoping to combine the two of these fields of study to work for a pharmaceutical company doing research or drug analysis.

My question is: what types of analytical equipment should I best familiarize myself with during my studies that would make me the most competitive candidate (for a job with one of these corporations) after graduation? I have asked a couple of my professors and they give me the generic: ""Oh, it shouldn't matter what your research is in, you can find a job regardless of what you use most commonly."" But I have begun to notice on many job sites that companies are looking for candidates with expertise in a particular machine or type of chemical analysis (MS being the most common). 

I ask because I was hoping to join a research lab that focuses on protein analysis using NMR, but that doesn't seem to be very ""in-demand"" in what I want to do... I am interested in the topic of study but don't want my decision to preclude me from getting a job in the particular area of industry after graduation.

While the actual processes for each of these tests are straight forward and the spec is decently easy to use; I do not know how I should be properly cleaning the cuvettes between samples and for storage. 
I was searching around online, but I could not find anything specific for the reagents that I am using:
For the **IBU** we use a mixture of *isooctane* and *2N HCl*.
**Diacetyl** we use the *distillate of the beer* plus an *alpha-naphthol* solution with *isopropanol* and a solution of *creatine* with *40%KOH*. 
**SRM** is just the beer.

I was planning on washing out the cuvettes with DI water, but reading online I saw the main recommendations were to use 2N HCl and a combo of DI water and ethanol. Would this be ok for the usage that I have? I was a bit worried about HCl reacting with KOH to form KCl in the cuvette.

Any advice on cleaning and storage would be really helpful!! Hopefully I could send you some beer as a thank you once we make sure all our tests are ready!

If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution. You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenge and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any molecule you would like me to challenge the community with, please let me know.

If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges! Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

Thanks for all the support and hope you'll enjoy this Synthetic Challenge!! Have fun!

Questions on moving from Masters to PhD & Industry vs Academia...,3,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1491612584,True,"I am in my first year of my Masters program doing organic synthesis. My aim has been on becoming a professor at a medium sized university, similar to where I have been for my undergrad and now working on my masters. So I'm pretty much set on getting my PhD. 
Recently, I have discovered the role of a process chemist and am very interested. The abuse of chemistry on the environment has always bugged me so becoming a process chemist seems like it would allow me to do work on that at a much larger scale. But then again I feel like that may become dull over the years and become somewhat repetitive, rather than going with academia and working on more stimulating projects like discovering and synthesizing drugs or molecular probes or whatever.

Please give me any thoughts you have on this choice between industry and academia, and the happiness/satisfaction longevity for either.

Now on to Question 1...

I would like to stay in the same area (Midwest) and preferably the same state. So my PhD choice is between the University of ... and ..State University. Both have professors working on research that I am very interested in. One is much more prestigious than the other in the hard sciences. But I much prefer the other one when it comes to location and campus. I'm aiming to go to the more prestigious, since why not, right.

What are other factors that should be taken into account when deciding which university to go for PhD directly after Masters?


And question 2...

What is the most beneficial degree for becoming a process chemist, Masters or PhD?

I would assume the PhD, but maybe a masters would be more likely to be hired since they would require less money for payment. The university I am at now is fairly close to a large chemistry company. I could try to work there directly after the Masters. But I think I would like to move away from this area after doing both undergrad and Masters here for a change of scenery.

Also...

How big of a leap is it from doing Masters work to PhD work?
I feel like my hand has been held the whole time since I moved into this synthetic lab. I couldn't imagine coming up with this all these quick fixes on the fly, especially during the work up of reactions and in identifying potential issues during reactions. I understand that it will start to come to me with time since this is only my first semester of doing any synthesis. But will this be something I learn to tackle throughout my masters or will this issue just evolve as projects become more complex? 

Any input on either topic, Masters to PhD and Industry vs Academia, or anything, is welcomed. 

Thanks :)"

Tungsten crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice with a unit cube side length of 3.16 Angstrom. What is the density of this metal (in grams/cc)?

I think I figured something out about metabolizing glucose but I wanted a chemist to confirm my hypothesis....,14,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1491707503,True,"So I am a student at McGill University studying physiology and am in a biochemistry course right now. This isn't a homework question though! I am very interested in the science of food and would love if a chemist confirmed what I've been thinking about. 
When learning about glycolysis, we learnt that at step 4, fructose-1-6-biphosphate is split into two 3 carbon molecules by fructose biphosphate aldose. One of the molecules is dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and the other is called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. In step 5, triose phosphate isomerase rearranges dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into another glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. BUT apparently when the body is 'happy' with the amount of energy that it has at the moment, the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate is not rearranged to G3P but instead goes on to create fat.

Now, if glucose from fruit is in the stomach, that glucose is surrounded by a plant cell wall. Plant cell walls start to break apart in the stomach but not all at once. That means that there is not a huge amount of glucose released all at once (since the plant walls protect it) relative to if you ate a bunch of refined sugar from a donut or something. So my question is: is this pathway in glycolysis one of the reasons that fruit sugars (although broken down into glucose just like refined sugars are) are healthier for us? Is it the fact that the plant cell wall allows a slower release of glucose so that dihydroxyacetone-phosphate remains in the glycolysis pathway and does not go onto fat synthesis? There is nothing to protect refined sugars, so the body converts all the sugar that gets there at the same time (in the refined sugar case), and therefore the dihydroxyacetone phosphate does not need to get converted to G3P so is more likely used to make fat?

Please let me know! Thank you!

Edit: a lot of your replies say that im assuming fruit sugars are different sugars. ultimately, i know that all sugars are broken down into the same thing - glucose. but i am asking if this pathway is correct.?"

Roadblock in iron loading of bovine transferrin experiment,0,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1491856446,True,"In an experiment that I am doing, I'm interested to observe iron loading in transferrin. This was done using iron nitrilotriacetic acid Fe(NTA)2 and bovine serum transferrin. The initial approach in removing unreacted iron was running the iron loaded transferrin and unloaded iron through a Sephadex column. 

I'm then asked to propose an alternative experimental approach to remove the unloaded iron to be able to determine percentage loading. 

The first I thought of was gel electrophoresis. However, I'm not sure that it would be efficient since the molecules are large, and the applied voltage needs to be high to separate then. However joule heating means increased band broadening. 

The second was a redox titration. Since the iron that is loaded is bound in transferrin, the unloaded one can be reacted with an oxidizing agent like KMNO4 to oxidize to Fe(III), however the concern here is if the loaded iron will also be oxidized - a question of how strong the binding is in transferrin. 

The third I have considered is an ion exchange separation column. I'm not sure what composition would be best suited to separate the two that are of interest. 

I'm thinking.. Is there a way to perhaps separate them through use of molecular weights? Since the iron loaded in transferrin is a lot heavier than free unbound iron, this could be factored in for separation. What about electrolysis using a partially permeable membrane in a solution of nitrilotriacetic acid? (just thinking out loud) however there is a concern of determination of an appropriate membrane as well, right? What about a porous division or a salt bridge? 

Are there better methods of approaching this problem? "

From what I gathered from the picture comments, it was a bucket of blue paint that sat for a year, separated from the oil(?), and the guy added a bit of yellow paint and stirred it around. 

Obviously I don't want to wait a year for paint to settle.. So at first I thought about using a centrifuge.. Then figured it would be easier to just buy the ingredients for paint separate (mixing pigment and binder, then adding oil(?) later on top). 

I don't have to use the exact ingredients in paint since this won't be applied to anything.. So if something works better, I'm all ears. I just need a timely method of congealing the pigment and suspending it in a clear liquid to recreate the layered/3D look. Then be able to have a bit of control to stir it around and experiment with visual compositions. 

It doesn't have to be suspended permanently, as I'll be happy with simply taking pictures like this, but if there was a way to ""freeze it"" in place permanently for wall/table art, I'd definitely be interested in trying it! (Maybe some sort of clear lacquer that hardens?)

What I'm not getting is how this reaction is able to produce 2.6V or so? I know that the 'same' redox reaction can have a different cell potential under different conditions of concentration/complexation etc, but a 2.6V difference seems far too large to be accounted for by that alone.

If this article is to be believed, [other scientists in the field seem to have doubts](https://qz.com/929794/has-lithium-battery-genius-john-goodenough-done-it-again-colleagues-are-skeptical/) about how the cell works as well.

How long until unhealthy fumes of oil-based wood finish will dissipate (list of components in post)?,3,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1491915795,True,"Hi,

It was suggested that I post this question here, apologies if it is too stupid.

Recently an oil-based wood protection finish containing solvents was used (2 coatings) on a table on my balcony. However, after 24 hours, I can still smell it. I am now wondering if it is safe to go near that table and how long it will take until the fumes will dissipate. 


For reference, the temperature outside is 19C/66F. 


The ingredients of this oil-based finish are the following: 

* linseed oil 
* titanium dioxide
* hydrocarbons C11-C13 isoalkanes (30% of total ingredients)
* hydrocarbons C11-C12 isoalkanes (5% of total ingredients)
* silicate minerals
* 2-BUTANONOXIM (1% of total ingredients)
* aliphatic compounds
* calciumcarbonate 

The label says ""avoid inhaling fumes"" but it does not specify a timeframe for when this applies. I am wondering for how long I have to be cautious.

Thanks for any help."

Decided to apply to grad school last minute but have no idea about the application process.,14,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1491939692,True,"Hi all,

I am currently an undergraduate chem major (junior) with a 3.90 overall and 3.92 science gpa. All my undergrad years, I have been preparing for medical school admissions. Meaning, my current rec letters, community experiences and what not all pertain to medical school. 

Im thinking about doing a phd in Chem. I love chemistry, but I'm also interested in a profession as a doctor (but absolutely hate biology, which is basically what med school is). Not to mention I suck balls at bio. So I'm a bit conflicted as to what career I'm choosing. As such, I am keeping all options open for now by applying to med and grad schools. This summer, I'm gonna take the GRE, and chem GRE and see what doors open up from there. 

I'm posting to ask what I need to do to prepare for a phd application. I know I need new recommendation letters (how many though and from what types of professors? Just chem profs?)

aside from two two years of chemistry undergrad research in materials chemistry, I got no other chem experiences (everything is health related like volunteering at hospitals and stuff because of my initial plan to become a doctor). 

Oh, I also have a first author publication to be submitted For review by the end of April -mayish (which according to My PI is a big deal?) I should have this paper out in time For phd applications but not in time for the medical application probably. 

How do phd applications work? When do they open? Is there one common app for all schools I want to apply to? What should I look out for? What schools do you recommend I should look into applying for? I'm interested in materials science. But I'll be happy in any inorganic lab (no orgo, or computation labs). My chances at getting into good schools?

Really starting to commit to the idea of leaving my PhD program with a masters...,38,64,False,False,False,chemistry,1491953110,True,"Vent incoming:


I'm in a chemistry PhD program in the U.S., beginning my third year, and have very recently passed my candidacy exam.
Getting pretty serious with the idea of leaving grad school, and it scares the hell out of me. When it comes down to it, I'm just not happy doing the type of work that grad school requires. I think I haven't been for a while now, and completing my candidacy exam last semester is kind of giving me the opportunity to re-evaluate my life ambitions as well as my mental state of mind. I'm seriously contemplating bowing out with a masters degree and searching for a job somewhere new/fresh, to experience something different. I just kind of feel like I'm in the wrong mental place, pursuing something that I know will make me look good on paper, but not really something I am 100% committed to. I'm not really sure if it's because I'm not 'mature' enough to handle the type of self-motivating work ethic being a chem grad student requires, or if it's just not my cup of soup entirely. Regardless, I've had difficulty finding motivation to maintain a rigorous work ethic, and reflecting on why that may be (over the past few months) has led me to writing this post now. I'd imagine wanting to quit is somewhat of a common thought for chem grads, and I've heard that the 3rd year is typically the most strenuous. However it feels like my situation is more of a ""I knew this was coming"" rather than a ""ahh this is hard I want to give up"". 


I'm curious to hear if any of you seasoned folk on /r/chemistry have felt what I'm feeling now, and also what helped you move forward with whatever choice you ended up committing to. A concern of mine is being able to find a job that would be appropriate for a masters chemist. Any sorts of recommendations of job titles/areas of work that would be applicable to someone like me would be very helpful.

Condensed Intro to Chem summer class,16,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1492004381,True,"Right now, I'm debating to take an Intro to Chemistry class at my local CC that starts immediately after the Spring semester rather than waiting to take it in the Fall. However, it's four weeks long, Mon-Thursday, 9-4pm. The instructor has excellent ratings and is highly recommended by students who've already taken Chem classes with her, so that's assurance that I'll learn something. 

I haven't taken a Chemistry class in over ten years. I did alright when I took chemistry in high school but had poor algebraic skills, but I'm doing very well in algebra now. I have no choice but to take this Intro to Chem class before taking Gen Chem 1. I'm completely fine with this since this class prepares me for Gen Chem 1 and I also knock out a lab requirement for my Associates. I also know my success in this class is going to be very dependent on my study habits and time management skills, but this is the only class I'll be taking for four weeks followed by another eight weeks of Pre-Calculus.

Four weeks is going to cram a lot of information in such a short period. I'm considering doing this since it'll free up my course load allowing me to take Gen Chem 1 this Fall fast tracking my transfer to a University for Electrical Engineering next year. 

Has anybody done accelerated sessions like this and is it better taking science courses during the summer rather than during the Fall/Spring semesters? If I do go this route, what supplemental resources besides KhanAcademy can I use to help me with the material? I'm more of a visual learner with an ""explain it like a 5th grader"" teaching method when understanding the basics.

Edit: I counted the actual days of this class, and it's going to be 14 days total. I'm still for it. However, there must be a catch to this as an intro class being this short. I'm thinking she's going to cut through the filler stuff and focus on core concepts for Gen Chem 1. I'll have to ask around and her personally to get a better idea. Thoughts?"

The concise encyclopedia of plastics refers to Tg as the reversible change in phase from rubbery to glassy so I'm left rather unsure what to believe.

"If every cation is associated with an anion, how can any system carry a net + or - electrical charge?",12,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1492096062,True,"Hello Reddit, 
I was always told that every positively-charged atom is associated with a corresponding negatively-charged atom, so that there can never be an imbalance of + charge to - charges in Nature. If this is the case, how is it that a system can carry a net charge other than zero? If every + has a - counterpart, why isn't every system neutrally charged on the whole? For example, if you add an anionic poly-electrolyte like PVSK to water, the measured electrical charge of the solution will become negative. If you add a cationic one like polyDADMAC, it will become positive. However, both of these polymers are neutrally-charged, being associated with counter-ions that balance out their anionic/cationic natures. Why doesn't the counter-ion (usually a K+ for PVSK, and CL- for polyDADMAC) exert a balancing effect on the charge of the system? Thank you!

EDIT: The precise property I meant by ""charge"" is Streaming Potential, measured in mV. To re-phrase my question: If all electrolyte salts contribute an equal number of + and - charges to a solution, why do some salts result in a negative Streaming Potential (mV) while some result in a positive mV?"

Good Organometallic Chemistry Graduate Programs?,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1492162801,True,"Hello Reddit,

I am a rising senoir and am interested in organometallic chemistry as a field of study for graduate school. Thus, I would like to know of some programs/labs that you would recommend I look at.

If any chemist on this subreddit are up to helping me out a bit, I would, of course, like to provide some specifics about myself.

Overall, I enjoy the methodology of organometallic chemistry, i.e. how the structure and properties of the catalyst are tuned to meet the specific needs of the application. There seems to be a good amount of 'working space' so to speak, leaving the field open to advancements and big discoveries. If this is a naive outlook, just tell me. 

I enjoy the more applied and practical side of this field of study, and would like to be introduced to some labs that emphasize catalysis (as applied to polymerization, for example) as opposed to inorganic chemistry for inorganic chemistry's sake.

Thus, I would like to know of some good labs to join that would provide me with good industrial career opportunities post graduation, especially in catalysis. 

I want to gain exposure to instrumentation, especially electroanalytical techniques. Are there any labs that emphasize/utilize cyclic voltammetry? 

To current organometallic chemist, some questions I would be interested in hearing your answers to, if any are applicable to you:

1. How would you sum up your field?
2. How long is your typical day in the lab?
3.How do you purify and characterize your products?
4. What is application does your research afford? (organic synthesis, polymerization, surface functionalization, etc..)
5. What are some of your favorite graduate courses in organometallic chemistry you have taken?
6. What do you find tedius about your research/work?
7. To what extent do you rationalize reactivity with molecular orbital theory?
8. Do you wish you specialized in a different field of chemistry? 
9. If you are in industry, how did you attain your current position?
10. If you are in industry, what do you do day to day? What pressures do you not like? Or, on a more positive note, are there interesting challenges that present themselves to you?
11. What are some quantitative methods you have gained in graduate school? (grant writing does not count)
12. What instruments are largely specialized for your field?
13. Do you work with cyclic voltammetry?
14. What are some extremely dangerous reagents you have worked with?
15. What is your favorite organometallic transfermation? (mine, as you probably would have geussed, is Tebbe olefination :)
16. Who is your favorite organometallic chemistr (historically or modern)
17. Textbook recommendations?
18. How often do you model with computational software such as gaussian? As someone who is not a computational chemist.

Which NMR reference to use when comparing comp. results?,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1492183092,True,"Hey all.

I'm currently looking into the spectroscopic properties of some simple (6 carbon) organic molecules using Gaussian. In particular, I'm looking at the 1-H and 13-C NMR chemical shifts.

While I'm comparing the results to literature values, I can't help but wonder if I'm going about it the right way. At the moment, I'm taking chemical shifts calculated at [B3LYP/HF]/[cc-pVDZ/cc-pCVDZ/aug-cc-pVDZ/cc-pTVZ] GIAO and referencing them to one of the in-built references in GaussView, which I was calculated at B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) GIAO.

Is this at all valid, or should I be comparing the results for my molecules to reference molecules calculated at the same level of theory? You know, like, should I be comparing the HF/cc-pVDZ GIAO chemical shifts to TMS HF/cc-pVDZ GIAO?

What resources are necessary to synthesise this Metal–Organic Framework (link in body) at home?,5,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1492206005,True,"Hey guys,

I'm very interested in working on self-sufficiency, in particular, I'm currently developing a farmbot at home. To make this more independent from utilities, I would like to ideally be able to pull water out of the air. Yes, I've seen thunderf00t's video on why this is infeasible using a direct method such as a peltier effect condenser, however, this paper, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.201500243/full, seems to have a promising methodology that could actually produce a significant amount of water using only solar energy (from the front page). It seems that the metal-organic framework that concentrates water in pockets, yielding areas of high humidity that are easier to condense water from with less energy. 

From what I've understood, the main steps of synthesising this metal-organic framework is growing a Titanium oxide nanowire matrix, synthesizing one of the metal-oxide frameworks they used (MIL-125, MIL-125(NH2) or MIL-125(NH2)1,2) and then depositing the metal-oxide framework on the nanowires.

So I am doing my PhD in organic chemistry with an emphasis on material science applications:

After finishing my MSc I stayed with my group for my PhD, because it was the easiest way to do it. (Not worrying about relocation, applications etc.) And I knew that my group is not the most productive, or well-organized. I thought, I will manage myself through that. So the group does not have a focus, but rather does everything. Total synthesis, bioactive molecules and material science stuff.

Now I am 16 months in and realize more and more, how bad the organization in the group is and that the PI is always fantasizing and motivating, but never providing the proper equipment, or considering recommendations for improvement. In the end my daily work is on-demand synthesis for numerous collaboration partners. I fear that have no real topic or story to tell, once I write my thesis.
What really frustrates me is that I only learn about cooking, and never get hands-on experience in the science/measurements involved for materials or devices.

So now my questions:

1. Is this normal mid-PhD crisis, and should I work on my motivation/persistence, because that is how science works?

2. If I quit, how to do it properly? (Regarding to the talk with my PI)

3. Is there any disadvantages I need to consider, when applying to a new group? (I know, I will have the ""quitter mark"" for future applications. But will there be other disadvantages that I am not aware of?)

4. Now this is probably the most important set of questions: Did you/friends go through this? How did it turn out for you/your friends?"

Don't know what career path to take - would appreciate some advice,22,24,False,False,False,chemistry,1492360786,True,"I earned my B.S. in Chemistry last spring. 

I did minors in Math and Physics, had a 3.9-something GPA, and had a little experience working on research with a prof.

I didn't apply to PhD programs because my parents were discouraging me from continuing to study chemistry.

Instead, they advised me to get training or meet requirements for admission to a professional program for a job in healthcare (medical school, PA school, optometry school). 

(I explained to them that I lacked interest/passion for that and I didn't have a personality would be well-suited for a career in direct patient care.)

They said that it would be a waste to do grad school in chemistry because there is no career in it. I also came across some blog posts by chemistry grad students and PhDs discussing how they were struggling and how they regretted their decisions, which was also discouraging. 

I decided to test the job market since I was out of school and had free time. After 3.5 months, I was able to get an entry level ""Chemist"" position through a temp agency, which didn't involve doing any chemistry. That temp position ended after 6 months, and I spent a month looking for another job.

A few days ago I interviewed for a lab technician position through the same temp agency and was offered the job.


Now it's almost been a year since I graduated. Since I didn't apply to grad programs before my senior year or after graduating, I've basically wasted 2 years. My parents are urging me to just make any decision now. I can go back go to school in 2018. 

My goal is to have a career where I get to do something science-related and can be financially independent, with the latter being more important.

So should I continue obtaining real-world work experience and hope for a good job in industry in a couple of years? Or should I get a PhD in chemistry to do that?

Or should go to a grad program for something other than chemistry? I've been thinking about chemical engineering. The pay looks good, but the projected job growth and number of positions look low.

Also, has anyone successfully changed career paths? If so, what did you do? What would you advise me to do? Feel free to ask me for more info as well."
[2+2] photocyclization mechanism help.,2,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1492362691,True,"I'm trying to understand the photopolymerization of C60

I'm using this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%2B2_photocycloaddition) article, and this [mechanism](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/22Mech.png) for reference.

My understanding of the reaction is:

1. Enone has 2 electrons in pi and 0 electrons in in pi*
2. UV excites an electron into pi* and its now a singlet.
3. Intersystem crossing (nonradiative) occurs to form a triplet. 
1. **Triplet interacts with ground state of the alkene, so that two radicals form a c-c bond and two radicals form a triplet diradical.** 
5. Intersystem crossing (nonradiative) to form a singlet diradical which then forms the other c-c bond.  

Can someone explain how step 4 occurs? Specifically:

1. How does a triplet interact with the ground state of the alkene - Are they close enough in energy to interact? 
3. How does the radical form in the alkene, wouldn't some energy be needed first?
4. Does the new homo of the enone donate into the pi* of the alkene to destabilize the c=c bond and that's how the radicals in the alkene form?

Pretty confused with what's going on. (I do understand that formation of the new homo gives allowed symmetry overlap with the lumo of the alkene, but don't get anything else)

Methylphenidate has a methyl group in the alpha position as a substituted phenethylamine. This methyl group is part of a piperidine ring.

Question on how to become a fragrance chemist? PhD path...,26,65,False,False,False,chemistry,1492458697,True,"Hi all, 

May I ask for advice in pursuing a PhD in fragrance chemistry? Are there any fragrance chemists here?

I'm currently a second year student of chemistry at Boston University, concentrating in organic, and I have a passion for fragrance and flavor chemistry. 

I'm currently part of a research group, working on asymmetric total synthesis of natural products, and developing biomimetic, 'green' pathways and procedures. I am also an amateur perfumer and distiller.

I would want to continue my research career by applying for a PhD program. I want to do nothing else than chemistry, and I love the field. However, I would want to work on a project thesis specific to fragrance and flavor chemistry. I would eventually love to work for Givaudan, or a similar company (but I love Givaudan). I know I need to 'specialize' and gain experience specific to fragrance chemistry to have any prospect of a career there, though. 

So, my question is how would one achieve this? 

Does one seek out chemists at universities who are already working on fragrance chemistry? If so, does anyone know of any active fragrance chemists?

Or, does one propose a fragrance chemistry related project as part of their application process? If so, how do I figure out which universities and departments would be more partial to accepting a proposal like that? 

Or, is it something else entirely?

I would want to work on either the synthesis of aroma chemicals (and developing new, greener methodologies), the extraction, isolation, and characterization of natural products (such as supercritical CO2 extractions), or a combination of the two. 

If anyone here is a fragrance or flavor chemist, or has any experience with this topic, any advice you could offer would be so appreciated. Thank you all for taking the time to read this! 

P.S. What are our favorite smells? I love geosmin, Calone, and ambers.

Red flags galore. Anyway, let's focus on one flag at a time: handing 100mg/mL nicotine solution (10% by volume) in such a limited workspace. 

I've read the MSDS from the manufacturer site which advises the obvious: highly ventilated work space (does this suggest under a hood?), particle filtering mask, chem resistant lab coat and nitrile gloves, goggles, eyewash station, lab sink - all as minimum precautions.

I'm in a very cramped space with 50+ gallons of flavorings, VG, PG and nicotine bottles everywhere: on the limited shelving, desk space and floor. It's difficult to enter/leave the room but there is one restroom on the far side of the building shared by a dozen employees. If I happened to spill the nicotine solution onto my hands or face, could I become ill if not washed immediately? Is a particle mask enough to protect me from the fumes? - also is there a max saturation point per mask, as they don't seem keen on me changing gloves or masks often. Any other inherent risks I should keep awake worrying about?

[Serious] Marijuana chemistry in Canada (once legal): bad idea for future employment?,10,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1492534615,True,"Hi, there.

I should be finishing my PhD in (in)organic/computational (mostly coordination and ligand design) chemistry a few months after marijuana is to be legalised in Canada.

"Advice for passionate, but struggling, chemistry student",5,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1492608340,True,"Hi all:

I need a bit of advice with my career in chem. I'm a 3rd-year chemistry student at a small institution, very interested in organic synthesis/flavor&fragrance chemistry/analytical. For my first two summers, I have worked full time @ cafes and in leadership programs at my university to pay rent, tuition, life etc. My GPA is good, and I'm super passionate about chemistry. I'm constantly meeting with my professors and talking about literature in their respective fields, and I think my motivation shines through in my academic performance. 

I have applied to 40+ internships for this summer and heard back from about 5. This was discouraging, of course, but I expected this, being from a small institution with literally no name in science. I had a really great phone interview with a huge company, then a series of ""marathon"" interviews -- they basically were quizzing me on orgo, and I thought I performed pretty well. After two weeks of silence, they finally got back to me with a rejection. 

So here I am, approaching my senior year, with no actual experience in chemistry. Of course, I've had labs attached to every one of my lectures (gen chem I&II, orgo I&II, pchem I&II, analytical, etc.) but no actual research or concentrations thus far. Summer internships are filling up fast. I wasn't late on the ball either, I started applying in January. 

It's becoming more and more likely I will be wasting this summer again, in a cafe, since mostly all internships have filled up. I'd like to graduate from undergrad and work in industry for a little bit before going back to get my PhD, but it seems like I've really f**ked up compared to my peers with loads of experience under their belts. 

Any advice is good advice. I want to use all this accumulated knowledge about chem in a meaningful way, but it seems like my brain is just going to rot away in a coffee shop for 4 months. Thank you for your help. "

Tissues suitable for mass spectrometry lab,6,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1492615108,True,"Hi everyone

I am currently working in a microbiological laboratory which also contains a LCMS. We have been having problems with polymeric contaminants in the MS, that I traced back to a brand of propan-2-ol wipes were using. Aqueous extracts from these wipes liberated polyethylylene glycol (m/z 528 + 44) polymers. I have since tested all the wipes, blue-roll and tissues we have in the lab and they all (apart from one) seem unsuitable for use in the lab as they appear to contain polymeric constituents.

I am not very popular in the lab now as everyone has had their tissues for blowing their noses, wiping their glasses etc. removed. The micro teams (me included) need to wipe down a lot of equipment, benches etc. after manipulation of microbial samples.

So the question is this: Does anyone have a suggestion for a suitable tissue/wipe that could be used in our lab that won't cause contamination in our MS spectra? Moreover, what do people in MS labs use for wipes?

If there is anyone with experience in that field I would love to get in touch! Here's two questions related to this article (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.orglett.6b03730) to begin:

- When looking at the incorporation of [18F]-fluoride into organic molecules, they give the amount of [18F] as GBq, which fine I can convert to moles easily. But then on their large scale preparation, they give a specific activity of the radiofluorinated compounds. My understanding is that if SA is not maximal, it comes from having some non-radioactive nuclide in there ([19F] in this case), but then where does it come from as they use non-carrier added [18F]? Please feel free to hit me with facts if I am completely mistaken.

- In the SI, they detail the calculation of the specific activity. I do not understand the units of the graph used though, how do you go from mAu*min to Becquerels?!

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to spend time to explain some things to me! I am also very open to references to books/articles :)"

The publication that performed this reaction said to react in THF under reflux for 60 hrs (70% yield). I am reacting 0.5 mmol of the first component and 2 equiv of the 2nd component (4-aminobenzyl alcohol) in ~60 mL THF (8.5 mM of component 1). My reflux setup contains a trap with sieves for removal of water and is being performed under nitrogen. Unfortunately after 48 hrs, this reaction is showing less than 5% conversion to product. I suspect the concentration may be too low and believe I can reasonably achieve >200 mM concentration based on their solubility - however the lower volume makes refluxing a bit more difficult.

Networking events: how to not feel awkward and weird?,8,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1492754238,True,"Greetings fellow chemists. I've started a PhD recently and we're expected to network with the industry guys. My boss invites people from industry to give presentations at our university, and we regularly do workshops, seminars, summer/winter schools with other PhD students and industry people... I have managed to sort-of chat with a few industry people, but beyond ""I love your chemistry and I want the same job as you later on"" (which is totally true) and interrogating them about their education, I don't really know what to say. It's awkward and forced. Adding them on linkedin after 1 conversation feels cringe-worthy. One of them even told me that they hate linkedin and they hate being added by random students. 

I get the impression that my boss is disappointed because he invites these people to help us network with them and his students don't make the most of the situation. Does anyone have any good tips on networking? Good conversation starters after someone's given a presentation?"

What exactly is a carbocation?,7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1492763704,True,"I was checking through the discussion boards for my organic synthesis class, and there was a comment on how an iminium ion is technically a carbocation based off of a resonance argument.

 From this, wouldn't it imply that a protonated carbonyl is also a carbocation (I don't believe this is correct)? Which brings me to my question, how is a carbocation exactly defined?"
Question about retention factor and temperature dependency,2,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1492764190,True,"Hi,

I am currently learning some analytical chemistry and want to order some equations to visualize how they interact and on what variables they rely.

It is always said that α and k are dependent on the temperature but I could not find any equation that make use of the temperature.

qustion about mosher acid NMR,7,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1492790008,True,"Im digging through NMR determination of absolute configuration and have question about mosher´s acid method:
Lets say I have derivative with configuration X and then make the derivatives with configuration R-X and S-X. I compare the two spectra - some signals are downfield and some upfield so I can deduce the configuration. However, I never run the method until recently and found out that the derivatives compared to the parrent compound have the signals shifted the same way. Is that a common ? I mean, I thought I compare the spectra of derivatives to the spectra of parrent compound as well but then I cant get any information unless I compare ONLY derivatives. Because when I compare spectra of R-X with just X or S-X with X, then in both cases i get same information (signals shifted to lower ppm, therefore giving me no clear information that can help me to deduce the structure)

[UK] - Depressed and anxious about my PhD situation,17,15,False,False,False,chemistry,1492973388,True,"Hi everyone,

I'm sure you're all fed up of people complaining and asking for academic advice on here but i thought i'd throw it out here as i'm not too sure what to do in my life at the moment. I started my PhD in October, ready to go and do some research. Now my supervisor is know to be a bit of a dick, but i thought i'd be able to cope with him.

So in the first couple of weeks i began to feel a bit shit. The post-docs i work with are extremely condescending, rude and unhelpful. I've had my personality insulted and my current knowledge insulted. I thought 'Hey this is just me being a bit odd again, it'll pass'. As the weeks went by i began to feel more and more shit and began to hate chemistry and myself. We have to present our work every month which is fair enough, but i find its more of a meeting where the supervisor can just lay into people for no reason and i cant deal with that. I'm already an anxious person and this just set me back over the edge so i went to the doctor to sort out medication and talk therapy. So far, i've managed to hold up but lately i feel like i'm at breaking point. I just want to leave, i have no interest in my research anymore and i have no interest in trying to please my supervisor as i just get shot down all the time. It's commonly known that he's like this, but i just feel like a bit of a pussy as other people have managed to deal with him.

Long story short, i feel shit about my PhD. I just want to leave, i have no interest in what i'm doing. Any self-confidence i had has been completely demolished and never felt so down in my entire life. Has anyone got any advice? Or been in a similar situation? 

Throwaway for obv reasons, i was reasonably active on this sub.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your replies. I've been for my CBT today and just broke down with one of my counsellors. I just couldnt cope anymore, was finding myself wanting to cry in random shops and just feel like a broken man. I'm currently in the process of seeing if i can swap supervisor, if not i have my withdrawl form ready to hand in. I really couldnt take much more of this.

Thank you all so much!"

My personal research has not been terribly informative so Id like some perspective.  It might be interesting to have the engineering background for potential jobs but also be able to pursue my deep interest in chemistry.

Hydrated lime/mason's lime for aquarium use,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1493040402,True,"This may be strange question but here it goes, but a little background.

Calcium Hydroxide (kalkwasser) is one method of maintaining proper levels of calcium and carbonate alkalinity in marine/reef aquariums.  The use of kalkwasser is normally added to a automatic top off container, or in a [""kalk reactor""](http://www.bulkreefsupply.com/aqua-medic-kalk-reactor-1000.html), which slowly adds the solution to the aquarium.  Another important element in the reef tank is magnesium, which as far as I know, allows us as hobbyist to maintain elevated levels of calcium and carbonate alkalinity.

That being said, I decided that I didn't want to pay hobby prices for something like Ca(OH)*_2_*, which is ~$4/lb, and I went rogue and purchased a 50lb bag of mason's lime from Home Depot for $8.  I took a picture of the back of bag which shows what is contained within: [Graymont Mortaseal](http://i.imgur.com/bhPEb8C.jpg).  I posted a similar question on the reef hobbyist forum, but I'm looking for a more neutral perspective.  So, will this product allow me to maintain calcium and carbonate alkalinity?  Additionally, will this product add magnesium in a form that will allow me to maintain the higher levels of Ca, and alk that I'm shooting for?

Atomic nitrogen for scramjet propulsion?,9,18,False,False,False,chemistry,1493131228,True," A problem with scramjets, which attempt to achieve combustion at hypersonic speeds, is that the high speed means the air is producing so much drag that it is difficult to achieve net thrust when combusting with just the oxygen in the air.

 So what if we also combusted with the nitrogen? Nitrogen makes up 80% of the air mass so perhaps this could provide sufficient thrust. The problem is nitrogen is commonly present in the atmosphere as N2, a molecule that is very stable, i.e., non-reactive.

 But at hypersonic speeds so much heat is produced that the N2 is ""cracked"", generating various nitrogen species, such as N, NO, NO2, etc.

 So how much energy could be produced by reacting hydrogen fuel with the various nitrogen species? How much for methane fuel?

 The energy density and thus Isp would be less than for reacting with oxygen but conceivable the thrust could be greater because of the greater mass of the nitrogen.

I've found that N-Heptane is the most reliable at removing adhesive labels without dissolving printed text or images, and doesn't over saturate paper fibers like Acetone does. However, the Heptane isn't universally effective. 

The catch is that the solvent must be effective enough to handle adhesive residues but not so harsh that is ruins the materials being treat.

I run fruit extract on this column on a gradient and collect a small amount of the flow through at a specific point (there are many many peaks all stuck together and I'm interested in one), and then rerun it on the same column but at 7% isocratic.

What is a better way to hold a 22L 3-neck flask in a water bath?,5,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1493328231,True,"At work we do a lot of large scale emulsion polymer synthesis. Since before I started they've been using 22L flasks in large water baths with immersion heaters. To hold the flasks, the chuckleheads use standard 3 finger clamps and consequently break a lot of glassware because 22L flasks are fucking heavy.

I think it'd be a lot better to distribute the weight of the flask on something like a ring stand that can be lowered into the water bath but before I try and reinvent the wheel I wanted to touch base with the community to see what other people use.

**So:** What would you use to raise/lower a 22L 3 neck flask into a water bath? Ideally it should safely support the flask when it's full as well as prevent the flask from bobbing when it's empty and partially submerged. It should also accommodate an overhead stirring rod."

As part of my research i use the formal synthesis by Fürstner & Thiel (JOC, 2000, 65, 1738) which utilises a RCM as a key transformation. 
The protocol requires 8 mol% catalyst, product purified via evaporation then flash chromatography (n-Pentane/EtOAc: 5:1-2:1). 
The product is reported to be isolated as a pale yellow syrup, however mine is consistently orange after 2 columns. 
I also see catalyst ligands in the NMR. 

I have also incorporated a basic cysteine wash as per All things Metathesis (http://allthingsmetathesis.com/metathesis-catalyst-removal-techniques/) but the catalyst still remains.

I'm currently about to start second year chemistry (Organic) and I plan to take at least a few courses beyond this as time allows (I already have my Comp Sci degree and a full time job and I've been in and out of grad school for Mathematics and Computer Science). So this is just a hobby.  As far as what I'll be doing I honestly don't know chemistry well enough to say exactly, but I think it'd be fun to synthesize various molecules you come across and see what kind of purity I could get after running the experiment a few times.

I probably won't ever get much past 4th year undergrad or 1st year graduate level knowledge since I can only take one night class at a time.

I understand that analysis and p chem have a decent amount of use for sub-mg level accuracy, but how often do these situations come up in practice?  

Should I spend the extra on 0.1mg balance or just go for a 1mg balance?  This decision won't affect future lab purchases much more likely just the timeline of the purchases. Eventually I'd like to get additional useful instruments as I start needing them like a centrifuge and/or autoclave. But I probably won't ever get a FT-IR for example."

Clarification on the Gibbs Free Energy,7,22,False,False,False,chemistry,1493384749,True,"Hello everyone, this is quite a basic topic that's been on my mind for years now but I've never really taken the time to properly address it in my head. What exactly does the Gibbs Free Energy represent? I have looked in a lot of online resources for exactly what it represents but have struggled to find exactly the clarification I'm looking for.

In my head, the Gibbs Free Energy is the amount of energy (some fraction of the _total_ energy) contained within a system that is available to be transferred over the course of some process or chemical reaction.

The equation G=H-TS gives its value, the _free energy_ is the total energy (H?) minus the energy that _cannot_ be lost (ST which I think gives a value of H). My initial question is why can some energy not be lost? Is the energy represented by H the energy within the bonds? Which part of that equation accounts for the attractive/repulsive forces between the molecules?

Does this mean that in a completely closed system with a 100% uniform distribution of temperature _cannot_ have a reaction which increases the free energy because this violates the conservation of energy?

What exactly contributes to the value of entropy and what contributes to the value of enthalpy and how are these forms of energy different from each other?

The reason for this, he told me, is that the water must run through the condenser slow enough to facilitate heat transfer from the glass to the water. Is there any truth to this? If anything, shouldn't a faster water flow replace the water in the condenser faster which would lead to more efficient cooling? I can't imagine it would have a large impact on the efficiency of the apparatus but am I right in saying that a faster flow would lead to a better (if only by a small degree) cooling effect?

"Looking for tips, suggestions, advice, direction, etc. for CdSe quantum dot synthesis",0,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1493660422,True,"Hi all, I've lurked here a while and periodically see pictures posted showing a spectrum of quantum dots in a collection. So it seems there is a good community of chemists who have run CdSe syntheses themselves. For a lot of different reasons I don't currently have anyone I know personally that I can get some help from so I'm first fishing what I can get from reddit before cold contacting authors of papers I have. I'm just starting to work with synthesizing CdSe quantum dots with a target size of 2.5 to 2.7 nm. My goal is to get the dots to fluoresce as strongly as possible, so I believe I need to minimize my surface defects in synthesis (based on the review papers I've read on the chemistry of QDs). 

My procedure is run inert using CdO dissolved in octadecene and oleic acid at 250 degC, quick inject hot Se=P(octyl)3 in octadecene (~150 degC). At ~40 seconds I quick quench by pouring over ice. After coming to room temp I separate my organics and aqueous using a sep funnel and store inert. I characterize using UV/vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy.

My goal is to next use these in a ligand exchange and replace the organic ligands with mercapto-succinic acid to make them aqueous. I haven't run this reaction yet, but when I do I'll come back for specific questions for that as I have them. But, I'll take any suggestions for this in advance too.

In general, I'm looking for any tips or tricks that anyone uses. I'm using just basic organic synthesis glassware: 3 neck flask with condenser, thermometer, teflon coated stir bar, gas tight syringe or addition funnel, beakers, funnels, sep funnel, heating mantel and heating tape. If anyone has a picture of their reaction setup I would be really interested in seeing that.

I only have UV/vis and fluorescence to characterize in my lab. In the next month I might be able to send out to another facility to have TEM run. What is a good technique to use to troubleshoot why my fluorescence is lower than desired?

I also need a lot of consistency in my synthesis. So if I use up a good batch of synthesized QDs and I do the synthesis again I can get the same quality each time. It seems like there might be an ""art"" to good synthesis. Any comments on this point will be really helpful!

Thanks!"

Paper Chromatography Question,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1493669696,True,"I took the AP Chemistry exam today, and the last free response question had to do with chromatography. You had 3 dots of ink horizontally at the bottom of the paper, and then it had a picture after the experiment with them traveling different distances. You had to respond which ink was the least polar based on distance traveled. It mentioned that the chromatography paper was polar, and the solvent was ambiguously a solvent. I said the dye that traveled the furthest was the least polar.

The reason this is so confusing is that I feel  whether the solvent is water or something nonpolar completely changes the answer. If the paper is polar and solvent nonpolar, wouldn't the least polar ink travel the furthest. Then if the water is the solvent, then the least traveled ink is the least polar. But the fact they left the solvent completely unidentified is really weird, especially considering AP chem course never really talks about organic solvents or anything other than water really.

Is it correct to say that in a situation were the chromatography paper is polar and solvent nonpolar, the least polar dye would travel the furthest?

I did some research, and some somewhat reputable websites that basically agree with what I'm saying. Still the fact that AP didn't identify the solvent but specifically mentioned the paper was polar is weird."

Question about setting up a lab.. (not a chemist),3,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1493688388,True,"(Sorry if this doesn't belong here, I don't see where else it could go, certainly not in the chemhelp subreddit)

I'm looking to open a LEGAL business that uses several pieces of lab equipment and I'm curious about set up(start up) efficiencies. 

I'll be using vacuum on the following pieces of equipment: rotary evaporator, a short path distillation tower, several vacuum ovens, and a extraction system. I think it would make sense to have a couple high quality vacuum pumps set up on a pressure regulated manifold system with check valves and maybe even a small volume tank. The vacuum pumps could be set up to turn on at different pressures so that you maximize pump life. You could have a rebuild kit( and spare pump) on standby in case of a failure. Energy costs would be less since running one pump all day is cheaper than running four or five different pumps cyclically throughout the day. 

Also, it would only require one cold trap instead of the several that's necessary to put before each vacuum pump.

This all goes for the chiller that runs cool water through the condenser on the rotary evaporator and input tower of the extract unit. 

Everywhere I've looked, it seems the standard in the industry is to have separate pumps on each of the subsystems. I don't think that's the most efficient. 

Can anyone explain how this isn't a good idea for a commercial lab?

Remedies to prevent Ni release from watches,9,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1493718489,True,"(B.S. Chemistry here, but more knowledgeable in Organic than Inorganic)

So I have an allergy that causes a rash to form where my skin is exposed to nickel. I have always struggled to find a decent metal watch that does not eventually release Ni from some component. I realized early on that cheaper watches release Ni from the band or back-plate. Upon buying a nicer watch that was advertised as Stainless Steel, I never experienced a reaction to either the band or back-plate. However, after several months of use with this watch, the area where the dial contacts the dorsal surface of my hand began to generate a rash. (I would like to note that this is not a mere friction issue, as the rash is characteristic of Ni reactions I've had in the past from pant and shirt buttons.) 

I've heard suggestions from colleagues to apply clear nail polish to the dial in order to create a chemical barrier, however this seems like a very temporary and messy remedy due to the nature of a dial and it's exposure to repeated friction. I've also considered affixing some type of fabric with an adhesive to surround the dial in order to create a physical barrier, but this seems like it would cheapen the aesthetic of the watch. Additionally, I've read that titanium watches are a decent alternative for folks with Ni allergies, but I've never found a titanium watch that sports the classic silver/gold color of a standard metal wristwatch.

Fellow chemists of reddit, do you have a remedy to prevent or lessen the release of Ni from a watch dial?

TL;DR: Allergic to Ni. Most affordable metal watches release Ni. Trying to find a chemical remedy to prevent Ni release."

Determination of aluminum (Al+3) by back titration using EDTA titration,0,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1493732307,True," Complexometric back titration generally performs when the metallic ions form a
stable complex with EDTA in a slow reaction or when a metal ion blocks an indicator. The
blocked indicator cannot release metallic ions, thus no color change will be observable at
the endpoint of the complexometric direct titration. Both conditions exist in the case of
aluminum ion, thus the ion is best determined by complexometric back titration along
with heating to enhance the complexation of Al-EDTA.

Procedure advice for alkali melt/fusion step in Pfleger's industrial indigo synthesis,0,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1493759024,True,"Hi, there.

I'm needing some advice on how to carry out the alkali fusion/melt step in Pfleger's industrial synthesis of indigo.  SciFinder comes up with nothing but vaguely-worded patents and two horrible documents out of Nigeria.  I would ***love*** to find a recently-written procedure on how it is made industrially (e.g., indigo for jeans, or however it would be made when ordering it from Sigma-Aldrich), but I can't find anything like that.  All original documents (e.g., Pfleger's patent) lack important details.

[This scheme](http://www.chemexplore.net/indigo-commercial.gif) (#3) outlines the synthesis that is used industrially; a melt of NaOH, KOH, and NaNH*_2_* forms indoxyl out of phenylglycine, which then spontaneously (in the presence of oxygen) oxidatively couples using a radical mechanism to form indigo.  The part that I'm having trouble with is finding a *good* procedure on how to do the melt.

I've seen arrow-pushing mechanisms that show NaNH*_2_* being used for either deprotonation or for imine formation (depending on the literature source), while another source says that it's merely a dehydrating agent, Le Châteliering the reaction forward.

Since I don't want to waste my NaNH*_2_* by having it react with water, I figured that I should dehydrate my NaOH and KOH first.  So far, I have ground NaOH and KOH together and brought the temperature up to about 200 ºC, at which point they become a liquid.  Putting this on a vacuum, I see a fair amount of water come off, and when I remove the vacuum, the mix solidifies (but is still soft, probably because I haven't removed all of the water).  I'm assuming that I would then add the sodium/potassium salt of phenylglycine, then the NaNH*_2_*.  In the Nigerian papers, they simply grind 5:5:1 NaOH, KOH, and NaNH*_2_* (seemingly in open air), then add nitrobenzene and reflux.  I'm leery about grinding NaNH*_2_* in open air (safety guidelines suggest grinding it under a hydrocarbon solvent, though perhaps I'm being overly cautious?), and I'd expect that the NaNH*_2_* would react with the water in the NaOH and KOH.

Assuming that nobody has a good literature procedure for this, I'm hoping to get some guidance on things like preparation of reagents and order of addition, and am interested in any other bits of advice that anyone may have.

I am using METAC monomer that comes in a solution of 80% monomer in water, that also includes inhibitor. Various publications report its use however in the experimental part the only thing they say is that they pass it through an alumina grade 1 column to remove inhibitor. So far so good. The problem comes from the fact that once the monomer finally goes through the column (because its highly viscous and also it crystalizes  as soon as water is absorbed from the column) the resulting purified monomer is now still ""wet"" and depending on the day and the column it can be really liquid or it can be a paste.

What i try to do is to rotavap it for an hour but there again its not that this guarantees me that the amount of water is the same in all of the batches of the sample.

4-Chloroaniline Safety Advice,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1493888935,True,"Hi all

I'm a chemist working for a small company, and the HPLC work we're doing requires us to dissolve a small amount of para-chloroaniline (4-chloroaniline, PCA) in 2M HCl. The PCA SDS is [here](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/MSDS/MSDS/DisplayMSDSPage.do?country=GB&language=en&productNumber=477222&brand=ALDRICH&PageToGoToURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sigmaaldrich.com%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Faldrich%2F477222%3Flang%3Den).

PCA itself is toxic, so obviously I'll be carrying this out in the fumehood, with standard PPE and a dust-mask on for added precaution - however the part I'm stuck on is 10.5 - incompatible materials. Here acid is listed, but I don't know why.

Does anyone know why PCA is incompatible with acid? Might this be a blanket statement aimed at preventing mixing with nitrogen-based acids and rapid nitrogen production? Will I be OK to dissolve 20mg in 2M HCl for analytical reasons?

In this program, I managed to get 5 publications, two of which are first author. I recently decided to go for my Ph.D. at Tufts University, (R1) but I am now having some doubts about that.

I keep hearing a lot about the job market for Ph.D's and how terrible it is. This in return made me think that maybe a M.S. is enough for a good job. However, all of the outsourcing to china has made B.S. and M.S. jobs vulnerable here in the US.

I then began to look into law as a career. It seems that people in the past have worked as patent agents. However, it sounds like a very boring job.

Any thoughts on what to do? Any suggestions or words of wisdom?

Need help figuring out why my homemade ferrofluid isn't acting quite right.,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1493973921,True,"So, going by a couple of videos ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgTDUAz-jTc and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsQh1AT6qUE ), I've been trying to make my own ferrofluid using vegetable oil and toner.

As directed, I added 50ml of toner to 2 TBs of vegetable oil. It came out quite thick, but the video said to add a bit more if necessary, so I did so.

The magnet (neodymium rare earth magnets, a stack of three each a bit smaller than a dime) did draw it around, but it was very viscous, and didn't produce the typical 'spikes' one sees in such videos. I added more oil to try to get the fluid to the consistency typically seen in such videos. I managed to thin it out to something similar, by adding much more oil than the 2 TBs originally called for, but it still just draws around the inky substance rather than showing the spikes of the magnetic lines.

Thus far I've only played around with it in the container I mixed it in, rather than putting it in the alcohol suspension I plan to, but I'm fairly sure it should behave 'correctly' anyway.

Something clearly seems wrong. Does anyone have experience making their own ferrofluid and have some ideas here?

Question about Isotopes (mixed elements)?,8,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1494071270,True,"So i was learning about elements and isotopes and there is a thing i can´t get in my head.

So most elements are mixed elements like Chlorine.
In the book it says Chlorine consists of two Isotopes, 75% of Cl35 and 25% of Cl37. 

Therefor how do i know an element is not a Mononuclidic element. 
Why can´t i just look at the periodic table and say Chlorine ist just that one atom(""isotope""). 
I mean in the periodic table Chlorine has the proton number Z=17 with a atomic mass of 35,452 in order to get the atomic mass i have to know the abundance of the Isotopes if there are more than one. 

Like: 37 x 0,25 + 35 x 0,75= roughly 35,45
I just confuses me that Cl35 the Isotope is like named the same as the Cl35.

But how do i know that it is indeed a mixed element or is this just given and i have to know Chlorine consists of two isotopes? 

Maybe i am just overthinking and i hope i ""explained my problem good enough"".

Career advice for a chemistry student,14,8,False,False,False,chemistry,1494084552,True,"Hi All,

I have a B.S. and M.S. in chemistry, and I have been accepted to a Ph.D. program at Tufts University (#80). Almost everyone who has given me advice on here has strongly suggested against going into a Ph.D. program (that is not top 20) because of the job market, outsourcing, and what not.

I have done a great deal of soul searching and I am trying to find other careers out there with promising potential. I looked at law as a possible career because most IP lawyers in chemistry have strong chemistry backgrounds. But the uncertainty of the job market there makes this career path very iffy. I just started looking at PA (physicians assistant) programs, which I find very attractive. I would have to complete a few requisite courses but it seems manageable.

What careers do people usually move on to when the leave chemistry?

"Career/Grad School worry and the allure of Comp Sci (or other alternative careers?), any advice is useful",4,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1494085918,True,"As newly minted BS w/ experience in industrial med. chem and a desire to be a R&D med. chemist, I've been strongly pushed towards graduate school by my bosses/advisors. I've been a 'good' student but I'm terrified of the career path. To keep it short, here are the primary reasons:

1. Necessity of graduate school. Average time in org. chem. grad school (5.5 yrs) combined with low wage and high rates of depression seem to be a recipe for disaster (as well a poor expenditure of my 20s). Watching all my friends begin their careers and live comfortably in our home city has been... hard on my psyche. 

2. The job market for med. chem. itself seems to be in constant despair, perhaps I read too much chemjobber. Synthesis seems to be getting cheaper and cheaper to outsource to china/india, leading me to wonder if by the time I graduate - all the jobs in synthesis will be gone entirely. 

With that in mind, I've contemplated remaining a BS level med. chemist but that idea has been scorned by most of my peers. I wonder if this is even a reasonable career path to take?

If higher education is truly required for me to provide a comfortable living for myself, is staying in chemistry truly a good idea? I could finish a BS in computer science in a shorter length of time than it would take to get a PhD and maybe leverage myself into a more data centered approached to drug design (inspired partly by a talk I heard from novartis recently). Even if that fails, most of my comp sci friends seem to have very easy lives right now working in generic roles. None of them have struggled for gainful, benefit-filled, employment.

Perhaps other routes involve trying for an MBA? I'm not sure what I would do with it, but its another trope I hear parroted a lot. 

I used to be more obsessed w/ science rather than making money, but ...being poor isn't fun. Would love hear opinions and advice. "

I bought some borosilicate beakers from amazon intending to do some simple experiments and learn about chemistry. 

When I got them I realized that they would make great vessels for tea and other food related projects. 

So my question is... to what extent (and I realize this varies greatly by chemical) can the beakers be used for food purposes after being used for not-so-food-safe purposes, like for example, simmering something in paint thinner. 

For example, I was trying to take a finish off some beads, and after soaking them in paint thinner, put them in a beaker of boiling water to boil of the remaining paint thinner. After cleaning it out, the beaker seemed good as new. I wouldn't trust it knowing what had been in it, but I doubt my senses alone would be able to detect anything harmful still present. 

Of course common sense would dictate getting a separate set for food use, but I still have realize that I don't actually *know* how to tell if they are safe or not after using with assorted chemicals, and that becomes a more epistemologically interesting question I hope you guys can help me answer.

I went to a university, read accountancy but left halfway. I have fairly decent GCE A level scores, good enough to get into medicine, ivy league universities etc.

Scholarships to foreign universities are an option but not sure if i would be eligible. Local scholarships may be out of the question as I have to pay unsubsidised fees if i'm pursuing a second degree. Works out to about $36,000 a year.  Any advice??? 

Any leads on which universities have the best undergraduate and postgraduate programmes for materials chemistry? I was thinking MIT since they have a Centre for Materials Science and Engineering.

lead-free primers,2,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1494147927,True,"Lead is bad for you, and sometimes I've thought about ways to reduce lead usage.

Rifle bullets are set off by hitting the back with a pin, detonating a small amount of impact-sensitive explosive (""primer"") which ignites the propellant. Lead styphnate is the usual primer these days; lead azide and mercury fulminate were used more in the past.

Cartridges with lead-free primers are now available, but most use lead because the lead-free alternatives are more expensive and less reliable.

Some years ago I thought of a few possible lead-free replacements for lead-containing primers. I tried to contact a few people at relevant companies but I couldn't get anywhere. Anyway I thought I might as well post one on reddit and see if anyone had any comments.

[Cyanuric triazide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanuric_triazide) is easy to make: trimerize cyanogen chloride, and react with sodium azide. It isomerizes to a ring form with 3 linked tetrazoles, making it more stable than typical organic azides.

It was considered as a primer 100 years ago! But it has 2 problems: it's too sensitive, and it sublimes.

You can make N-oxides of tetrazoles with [potassium monopersulfate](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja106892a).

The azide form of cyanuric triazide is responsible for a lot of its sensitivity, and N-oxidation traps it in tetrazole form. (N-oxides of single tetrazoles are usually a little less sensitive in general, too.) N-oxides are also highly polar, so it doesn't sublimate.

Of course, you do still need to manage crystallization, as impact sensitivity tends to depend on crystal dimensions - people have even managed to bring the sensitivity of regular cyanuric triazide down to good levels by making smaller crystals.

"I need to learn chemistry from scratch, without access to electricity; can you help me select a bibliography?",23,86,False,False,False,chemistry,1494172894,True,"Greetings, everyone.

I was born and raised in an underdeveloped country. As it happens with everything related to our government, the national education system is but a farce and the few of us who want to learn something must find ways to do it *despite* our schools.

Although I have finished high school, my knowledge in most areas is lacking, to say the very least. When it come to chemistry, I have retained some random pieces of information, which, put together, are far from composing a comprehensive whole, a system.

To be more precise, I was given a few recipes—""now here's what happens if you add this reagent to that, etc.""—but I ignore the methods, the different ways to approach a given problem, how to choose the best tool, and so on and so forth—to sum it up, I am, basically, illiterate.

Since I expect to have more free time in the near future, I decided to take care of my education. I cannot hire tutors, I cannot learn by watching (or listening) to courses, therefore I will have to study with books.

And here I am. I want to ask you, what are the best book (or books, or, preferably, series or collection of them) I can use to learn chemistry from the scratch to a relatively advanced level of proficiency?

I do not need to delve too into the deeper, esoteric levels of the discipline—I do not intend to get a Ph.D. in chemistry any time soon—but I want to be knowledgeable enough to be capable of going through a demanding engineering course, for example.

I know that learning from books might not be optimal, but I really have no other option, and I have no trouble in making connections, in learning by myself from a source that does not present many lacunae—my English, for instance, is self-taught.

Be that as it may, the project must be self-contained—living in the farm, without electricity, I will not be able to access the Internet to read articles, and this is also the reason for my not resorting to audiovisual content.

Can you please advise me? Also, if you can suggest some extra reading besides the core content (meta-content, books that might assist the learning process itself, such as Barbara Oakley's *A Mind for Numbers* for math), pray do.

Thank you very much.

P.S.: For mathematics, which I also intend to study, I already have here *Mathematics: Its Content, Methods, and Meaning*, by Kolmogorov, Lavrent'ev and Aleksandrov, published by the M.I.T. press, but although I think it will be a valuable resource in the future, I believe it would not be a good starting point.

P.P.S. I have looked into posts about independent learning, but most of the replies assume access to the Internet or, at the very least, electricity, while I will have to make do without them (and consequently without the free online resources, such as Khan academy)—hence my posting this. The lists of textbooks I have found here are rather extensive, and the works sometimes are quite specialized; I am trying to craft a program more suitable for my specific situation/objectives."

The instructions say use opalescence once a day for 30 minutes, but those are similar instructions to the crest luxe strips, which didn't work for me. To my understanding, 35% Opalescence contains around 11.7% hydrogen peroxide while Crest Luxe Strips contain 10% hydrogen peroxide. Does the extra 1.7% hydrogen peroxide make that much a difference? Or does the carbamide peroxide from opalescence contribute to the whitening? I thought carbamide peroxide just turned into hydrogen peroxide when in contact with water. I don't want to make the same mistake with a different product and I'm guessing my teeth needs more exposure to whitening products rather than just once every 24 hours.

Need help extracting a chemical from an agar plate [x-post /r/labrats],10,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1494375019,True,"Hi /r/chemistry,

I am interested in extracting a chemical (to be specific, the siderophore [enterobactin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobactin)) from an agar plate. I have grown some microbes up on these agar plates, and the idea is to quantify how much enterobactin they have secreted into the surrounding agar using the procedure described in [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157799&type=printable):
>The cell free supernatant was acidified to pH 2 using 5 N HCl and enterobactin was extracted once adding an equal volume of ethyl acetate and mixing with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. The organic fraction was collected, dried in vacuo and resuspended in methanol.  

followed by conducting the [Arnow Assay for catechols](http://www.jbc.org/content/118/2/531.full.pdf).

I am looking for a way to essentially dissolve the enterobactin-containing agar without:

* heating up the agar (this kills the enterobactin)
* using chemicals that don't go well with acid (e.g. guanidinium thiocyanate)

Anyone have ideas? 

------
To address some obvious questions:

>Why not just grow the microbes in liquid?

I've tried that, but these microbes don't seem to secrete siderophores (appreciably/at all) in liquid, as measured by the [liquid CAS assay](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2952030) and also the Arnow assay.

> Then how do you know they're secreting them at all?

They have crazy-positive results with the [O-CAS method](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701207001315), which isn't specific to catechols but nonetheless gives clear positive results when siderophores are secreted. They also give *slightly* positive results when doing the Arnow assay on supernatants of cells grown in liquid, but nowhere near what they should be when considering how much they secrete on solid media. 

> What have you tried so far?

To see if any of the chemicals we have in lab can dissolve agar, I've taken the agar from half an (uninoculated) agar plate, added it to a 50 mL conical tube, and incubated it with 10 mL of each of the following chemicals for a few hours to see if any of them dissolve the agar:

* Ethyl Acetate -> Nope
* 5 N HCl -> Nope
* 6 M Guanidinium thiocyanate -> Yes! BUT doesn't go well with acid (chemical warfare, anyone?)
* 95% EtOH -> Nope
* 6 M Guanidinium chloride -> Nope

It *looks* like chaotropic agents are a good way to go, as they disturb the H-bonding network that keeps agar in its gel-like state. However, EtOH and guanidinium chloride are chaotropic but did not dissolve the agar, so clearly I can't just use any old chaotropic agent. I know there are others, but I would want to make sure that I can remove it later during the extraction steps described above, even if it means adding a step or two. 

Surely somebody here has some experience/expertise?"
Do nitrogen oxides (such as NO2) naturally break apart to N2 and O2?,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1494375994,True,"I am researching catalytic converters, and the resources I read all say the catalysts cause the nitrogen oxides to split into nitrogen and oxygen.

(I have plenty of time, so if what I want to do isn't feasible, I can change it.) My goal for this project is to separate common soft drinks (e.g. Diet Coke, Mountain Dew, etc.) into as many of their components as possible, and one of the steps involves decaffeinating the soda. Most of the ingredients are easily obtained and disposed of, but I ran into one- dichloromethane - that posed some problems.

Dichloromethane, as I discovered while doing toxicity research, is a likely carcinogen, and skin contact must be avoided. The decaffeination procedure will occur under a fume hood while wearing gloves, so this should not be too much of a problem. However, if I buy dichloromethane in a quantity sufficient to perform this experiment, I will have a good deal left over, as well as waste contaminated with the dichloromethane used. The MSDS is very cryptic about disposal, mentioning only ""RCRA U-Series"" and ""RCRA P-Series"".

In short, how do I safely get rid of dichloromethane-contaminated waste, and then how do I get rid of any remaining dichloromethane in the bottle?"

Application to harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, one-electron and many-electron atoms, and homo-and hetero-nuclear diatomic molecules. 2nd semester P chem: Group theory. Application of quantum mechanics to polyatomic molecules and molecular spectroscopy. Intermolecular forces and the gas, liquid and solid states. Distributions, ensembles and partition functions. Transport properties. And the 3rd and last P chem course: Development and application of the general principles of thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics. Chemical kinetics, rate laws for chemical reactions and reaction mechanisms.

Are these classes going to be mostly mathematical plug n chug type of courses or will there be emphasis on theory and how things work the way they do? I've always been scared away of this topic so I would appreciate some genuine feedback from people who have gone through this.

Effects of piranha solution on metals,18,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1494484969,True,"First off I am not a chemist so I appreciated any advice you can give including the famous advice of stop what you are doing before you get hurt. But I want to know about how piranha solution, 3:1 sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, reacts to aluminum and iron.

Long story as to why. I have a steel bolt broken off in an aluminum part. I know from past experience that sulfuric acid will eat away the steel leaving the aluminum relatively untouched. Side note I have drilled out everything to almost the minor diameter of the threads and it is still locked in placed. 

The aluminum is protected by a thin layer of aluminum oxide that the acid will repair if damaged. This reaction is also very slow, like take a few days to remove enough material to run a chasing tap though.

I thought it was an oxidizing reaction and I recalled that you can help oxidizing reactions along by adding hydrogen peroxide to the acid from other experiments.

So when I googled adding hydrogen peroxide to sulfuric I find out its called the piranha solution and everything is about how it reacts to organic compounds. But I can find nothing about if it will help me in my situation where I want to eat away the steel and leave the aluminum untouched. 

So yeh thanks for any help you can give me. "

Advice on how to remove a reagent,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1494636878,True,"First post on Reddit.

The link has the right starting material and product, but I'm using different conditions on a much larger scale (I've done/tried both).

Running a reaction with the following

1) Glucosamine HCL (starting material)
2) DMF (solvent)
3) TEA (base)
4) DMAP (activation catalyst)
5) Ethylisothiocyanate (electrophile)

The Ethylisothiocyanate should react with the starting material to form a thiourea sugar. This works well - however - removing the leftover ethylisothiocyanate (even at 1.2 equivalents) and DMAP (or pyridine if used) is difficult.

Working on a 134 gram scale.

Work up includes 5 washes (2x H2O/Brine, H+, NaHCO3, Brine,) followed by high vacuum to remove the remaining DMF. 

Tried a column in 95:5 DCM/MeOH but still having trouble with this ethylisothiocyanate. 

Any thoughts?

Acetone vs. Vinyl - Fight!,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1494637797,True,"I'm wondering about the long term affect of getting acetone on vinyl.

I did a test patch and it seems to have dried ok - not tacky or apparently damaged.  That's just after one day though.

So wondering if this will damage the vinyl long term - maybe it will get gooey or something.  Also, is there something I can follow up the acetone with - neutralizing it and it's behavior?"

How Does Nuclear Fusion Release Energy?,8,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1494658018,True,"I just cannot seem to understand how nuclear fusion releases energy. Every answer I find on the internet just points to a nuclear binding energy curve without actually explaining why the curve is how it is, or just says ""nuclear fission releases energy by fusing two small nuclei into a larger nuclei"" well... duh, lol. 

I cannot figure out an explanation on a nuclear level as to how fusion releases energy. 

Fission, on the other hand, makes total sense to me. The coulomb forces in a large nucleus are stronger than in small nuclei, so the strong interaction within the nucleus must be ""stronger"" within larger nuclei to keep the nucleus bound together. Once the large nucleus is broken apart the strong force no longer needs to be as ""strong"" as it previously was, and the resulting energy is released. 

I know I may have butchered that a little bit but at least that's how I understand it.

As far as how energy is released in nuclear fusion.. I'm still totally lost. "

So a few days ago I went out and purchased some labware to start performing some experiments.

One think I forgot to purchase was some sort of detergent for labware
And generally one thing I'm very uncertain of is how exactly to clean labware? (may I add I'm germaphobic)
I read online that generally it's a good idea to rinse labware either with a weak base or acid first if you had a strong acid or base in it to neutralize it then rinse it with distilled water
And that if you had something in it not solvable in water you should give it a rinse with alcohol (acetone is one I saw commonly)
And lastly to make sure to fully fill it with water to displace gases if you used any

But is just a couple rinses with water truly enough? And what exactly is a ""rinse""?
Also all articles I read stated using ""distilled water"" and I purchased just that from a pharmacy but was surprised that it contains 0.9% NaCl (I believe this is the type of water used for injection)
Is this the right kind to clean with? I was under the impression it should be 100% H20

lastly the labware I got is a bit filthy (a lot of dust and perhaps some grease and other things)
How would I go about cleaning them for the first time? 
I was considering perhaps using normal dish soap and then rinsing with Distilled water? Or should I purchase some labware detergent?

Today, they were making some of the smoothies and they came out noticeably pink. No one in our group text knew why. The ""result"" we came to was that they had used fresh blueberries which had been frozen overnight in our freezer instead of the commercially frozen blueberries we buy. 

Would using fresh blueberries (which may slightly ferment = more acidic) that are frozen vs. using commercially frozen blueberries result in a change in smoothie color?

Avoiding precipitation in metal solution for culture medium,4,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1494949056,True,"Hi Redditors,

r/chemistry has been kind to me before when I've had lab problems, so I thought I run this by you all.

I'm in the process of preparing to make several 20 Liter bottles of liquid culture media. The media contains a buffer, four carbon sources, amino acids, vitamins, and metals. I combine all the ingredients and then filter sterilize the medium. However, at the moment, I'm in the process of preparing only the metal solutions. My idea is to prepare a large, concentrated amount of metals, which I can then aliquot into smaller volumes that would be frozen and added to the medium during preparation.

My problem is that during the preparation of metal solution there is a large precipitation as soon as I add manganese chloride tetrahydrate. Here is a list of all the metals that I add to a solvent of sterile, demineralized water:

ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate 0.12 g
calcium chloride dihydrate 1.2 g
cobalt(II) sulphate heptahydrate 0.12 g
copper(II) sulphate pentahydrate 0.12 g
iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate 1.6g
magnesium chloride hexahydrate 80 g
manganese chloride tetrahydrate 1.6 g
zinc sulphate heptahydrate 0.12 g

I add the metals in the order that they are listed to 700 mL water, which I would eventually top off to 800 mL. 

Does anyone know what is causing the precipitation and how to avoid it?

The pH of the solution up until I added manganese chloride tetrahydrate was between 4.5 and 5.0 (I can't remember exactly but it was definitely in that range). There was previously no precipitation. Would keeping the pH around 7 help?

Any tips would be appreciated!

"Lost with the N,N-dimethylation of an aniline",3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1494975735,True,"Hi everyone!

I have a great problem that involves the methylation of an aniline. The problem is, that it has a protic base sensitive group on it and the ""normal"" dimethyl-sulfate/NaOH method would decompose my molecule, no methods would give a product that involves any aqeous base, however TEA or pyridine is fine. 

The results so far : it gives a tar with the Eschweiler reaction, gives various products with methyl iodide and currently a reaction is running with trimethyl phosphate. 

I think that maybe a dimethyl-sulfate/pyridine or something like that may help, but I find 0 recipes for this transformation. Anyone else has any idea? 

Many thanks!"
Determining optimal time and temp for an organic reaction,6,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1494978435,True,"So I work for a very small biotech company making a drug. We are trying to optimize our process as we get maybe 20% yield on a good synthesis. We are heating a reaction (producing an imide, can't give too many details as it is proprietary) for 18-24 hours at 100°C. I have no idea why we do that, the process was implemented years ago and was never optimized. I am trying to figure out flaws in the process that could be killing our yield.

Are there any downfalls to heating a reaction for an excessive amount of time other than wasting time? Is there any substantial benefit to heating the reaction at 100°C vs a lower temperature like say 60 or 70°? I wonder about the high temp long run time contributing to degradation of the target product. The flash point of one of the starting materials is 120° but other than that I don't think there are other major temperature limitations.

Also, does anyone have a good solvent/mobile phase for normal phase TLC to detect anhydrides?"

However, so far I have only been able to find experimental values for activation energies (and some of them vary quite a lot). Given the amount of content that I have, I don't think I can pick all these values manually and add them to the game.

Therefore, I want to know if there is any theoretical model for activation energy of a reaction, knowing only the reactants and products involved (assuming things such as temperature). I'm not overly concerned with whether this model is very accurate, as long as it is consistent.

Chromatography: Loss of peak resolution without any change in back-pressure or retention time?,4,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1495129137,True,"I work in a high-throughput mass spec lab (blood profiling) and I am running into a strange issue with a UPLC-MS method. In short, I am getting rapid loss of peak resolution, while my retention times, column back pressure and peak areas are staying constant. Usually I see loss of resolution accompanied by increases in back-pressure and shifts in retention, but here I'm getting neither.

The method itself is well validated with around 15,000 patient samples ran on it since we implemented it. The method uses a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (1.7um 2.1x100mm) column with a Kinetex C18 guard. It's a 5 minute gradient elution ramping from 30:70:0.1 ACN:Water:acetic acid to 50:50:0.02 ACN:IPA:Acetic acid. The sample is protein crashed and SPE cleaned up plasma. Typically for this method, the guard is changed out every 500 injections and the column every 2500 injections, which is about when we start to lose resolution between closely resolved peaks. However, recently we have been getting loss of resolution by 500-600 injections. Flushing the column with ethanol, methanol, IPA and ACN have had no effect in restoring the column. We have swapped out guards, ran with no guard, inverted column, etc and peak resolution is unchanged. 

Edit: This has happened with three consecutive columns thus far. I have ordered new columns from a different lot but they haven't arrived yet. Also, samples are resuspended in 80:20 water:ethanol for injection"

Could the numbness in my right arm be any way related to orgo lab? Serious post please,24,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1495151355,True,"Hello everyone,
I’m really confused as to why my right arm has been feeling numb here and there and I’m wondering if by any chance, if it’s related to orgo lab? I don’t want to sound like I’m overreacting but I wanted to rule out any possibilities. I really didn’t think anything the first time I felt the numbing, I thought it would go away, and I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but the numbness still pops up here and there and now I’m getting worried and I can’t figure out what could have caused it. 

If this isn’t the right forum, I do apologize, and please let me know where I can post this.

Here are the two possible labs that could be related to this: 4/21/ Nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, 4/28 Luminol & synthesis of aspirin

I don’t recall which lab corresponded with each specific incident, but basically after one lab, my right arm felt numb to the point where as soon as I got home, I submerged my arm in hot water and placed a hot towel on it. After that incident, I really didn’t think anything of it and I didn’t want to overreact and thought it would go away. 

I can’t recall the specifics but I think during one lab, my right arm may have started feeling a bit numb already before I even started the lab, I was just simply in the lab room. I recall a very slight feeling of numb sensation. 

In essence, I can’t recall the specific timeline with when I noticed the numbness, it could have happened in any of these two labs, or maybe only one of these labs. 

It’s been probably 2 or 3 weeks now and I don’t feel the numbing everyday, but maybe every three days, it’ll pop up again. It’s only on my right arm. I attached pictures, where it shows on my right arm, there’s this faint weirdly oddly colored spot on my right wrist. Here are the pictures: http://imgur.com/a/k3dcL That was never there before. I can also tell the numbing sensation kind of originates from that spot and I feel the numbness on my entire right forearm.

There is no itching, no pain. Just the dull numb feeling. 

I don’t recall any spills at all in lab and I always had gloves on and I had a long sleeve lab coat. I’m pretty germophobic so if there was any spill, I would have noticed right away.

I’m really confused. I don’t want to say it was related to the orgo lab because there was no spill or anything but I can’t think of anything else. Plus with the first incident where I had to place a hot towel on my arm, the numbness had come up during orgo lab.   

Also, I may just be sensitive because I remember this one lab (it wasn’t the two labs I had listed here) where I had a huge headache afterward and I went to sleep as soon as I got home. That night, I kept dreaming I was dreaming that I was dreaming and I wanted to wake up but I could not. I had like dreams within dreams. That’s the best way I could explain it. But that never occurred again so I didn’t think anything of it, I just thought maybe I had inhaled too much fumes during that lab. But now that I think about it, I may be sensitive or something.

Below I listed the chemicals for the two labs. Is there anyway I’m sensitive to a certain compound or something? I don’t know. I have to see a doctor but I know doctors don’t know everything and with the internet, you can reach a wider audience.

I am using an internal standard normalization (so far it produced the best repeatability results) and would like to some how to keep using it in the quantitative model. My issue is that if the base element of an alloy is Fe and I am trying to measure %w of Ni and Cr, then the ratio of Ni/Fe is not only affected by the %w Ni, but also by the %w of Cr as well, since more Cr means less Fe and a different Ni/Fe value for the same %w Ni.

I have standards with different and more-or-less known amount of Ni and Cr.

If there a standard way to handle this type of problems? It seems like something people have run into many times and there should be cookie-cutter solutions, but I have a lot of difficulty to find one. So far the only discussed models I've seen is a change in %w of one element, while others are locked constant.

A textbook or a journal paper discussing the solution would do just fine.

Drug structures,6,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1495227216,True,"Medchem talk today, somehow all drugs look the same. aromatics connected by ether or amide bonds, a fluorine somewhere in proximity to the active site, probably a cyclopropene somewhere, 0 to max 2 stereocenters, probably no quaternary carbons at all etc.            

Is this mostly due to how commercial screening libraries are limited to certain topologies or are those really the most efficient possible structures ?            
Ease of synthesis is probably a part of it.           
But seeing how natural products look incredibly different from this, I somehow doubt this structures are the best we can come up with. After all natural products evolved in million years to get a certain effect as efficiently as possible.                          

Is there any push towards more diverse topologies in drug design and screening ?

I know most pharma companies closed down their natural product divisions due to lack of succes. But I could see combinatorial approaches to build screening libraries of ""natural product like"" molecules be very useful.             

Would be interesting to hear the thoughts of ppl more experienced in the field on the topic. "

Can you make a galvanic replacements between gold metal and silver ions?,1,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1495403663,True,"If you have silver metal and you put it into a solution of gold ions (like AuCl4-), you will see a thin layer of gold forming on the surface of the silver metal. 

The reason being because the reduction potential of the gold is greater (when compared to the same standard) than silver's. 

But if I'm not mistaken, the reduction potential can change if the metal is in a different compound, with different ligands or conformation. 

So my question is: is it possible to have a coordination compound of silver, with some ligands or something different about it that increases its reduction potential? If so, can we make it greater than gold metal so the galvanic replacement happens ""backwards""?

How can I quantitatively measure reaction end time?,5,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1495480030,True,"So I'm designing an experiment for measuring how the reaction time of copper and ferric chloride is dependent on temperature; here's the reaction:

FeCl3+Cu⟶FeCl2+CuCl

The problem I have right now is how to quantitatively measure when the reaction has ended. I know you can visually see when a small copper rod has completely dissolved, but I need there to be a quantitative aspect to it rather than qualitative.

I've thought of using a pH probe to see if the pH changes after the reaction takes places and stays static, which I could leverage as an endpoint of the reaction, but the pH probes at my school are damaged, I think, since the reading keeps jumping around by about 3 or 4.

I asked my teacher about using a Spectrometer, since the color of the solution does change from a dark brown to a dark green in the end, but he said the reaction is too slow, thus the color difference would not be significant.

I don't see why I could not do that. The reaction is rather slow but the the color does change more and more as the reaction progresses. If I could have set time intervals of taking the absorbance reading, I think that would work.

The oxidation of the gold by the nitric acid, which produce NO that will leave the reaction and the formation of AuCl4- by the Cl- from the HCl. At the end I'll just have AuCl4- and H+ in water. And of course the rest of the non gold content of the ring.

I was thinking about recrystallizing to purify it, but I cannot find the solubility curves of HAuCl4 to compare with AgCl (supposing it has silver in it) to make the most out of it.

Does anyone one can think in a better way to purifying it?"

And why do people use incredibly complicated methods to find the concentration of protease and the such. Why can't people do a biuret test, and find out the concentration of protein at wavelength 550nm. Then they can react it with a solution containing protease and repeat the biuret test to see the concentration of protein left over. While it definitely is not accurate enough to be part of proper science research, will it at least allow us to have a decent understanding about the concentration of protease in the solution? I also understand that they are also many other factors that will denature the proteins ... but is such a method even reasonable in the slightest, like can it yield proper (but not precise or accurate) results?

Copper plated gold ring,9,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1495641448,True,"Hello, I'm completely new to reddit so forgive me if i break anyposting rules...

I'm working on a ring concept to propose later this year. Essentially I want a gold ring plated in copper.

I need some advice from someone who understands chemistry I think.

My understanding is that when you mix a base metal (copper) and a noble metal (gold) - and they get wet they will form a battery and the copperwill corrode - this is evident in gold and iron mokume rings.

This is something I want to embrace though. The idea is that the gold would be engraved and then plated in copper to hide the engraving - over time thecopper will disappear and reveal the hidden gold and the engraving.

My question is - am I correct that the copper would corrode?  As someone recently messaged me this:

""The electro potential of copper is +.34
The electro potential of gold is     +1.5
The electro potential of silver is    +.84 and no one worries about combining gold and silver. As far as I know batteries are formed with elements with plus and minus electro potentials (lithium has an electropotential of-3.4)""

Also if I am correct how long might i expect it to take before the gold is revealed?

I'm aware that copper would make the skin green - As far as I know its not something a decent scrub wouldnt wash off so I dont think my girlfriend would mind that much.

How to bring up a raise/potential hire after graduation for the place I intern for?,4,15,False,False,False,chemistry,1495680343,True,"I'm in the chemical industry and have been interning at a company for a year, and will be there at least for another year when I graduate. For the first 6 months, I was working strictly under one supervisor, until he left the company. When he left, someone within our department got a promotion, and I have been doing a lot of her responsibilities (I'd say 60-65%) since her promotion (she is a salaried scientist with a master's degree, with about 7 years experience. If I had to guess her salary before her promotion, I'd say 60-65k) My number of responsibilities have significantly increased since my first 6 months there, and after working there for a year already, I'd like to request a raise. I've always made $15/hr, and I don't think $17-$18/hr is unreasonable, although a 20% raise seems unrealistic. I was wondering how I can go about mentioning a raise to her, so it doesn't seem like I'm demanding more money? For reference, some of my newly developed responsibilities include: help replacing/maintaining GC columns and inlets, creating standard curves for our sample analysis, and method development for specific compounds/methods (such as studying the validation and reproducibility of our analyses). I kind of feel like my role is half-intern/half-employee at this point, but I just don't have all the knowledge with our department's previous experience with our samples and the experience in maintaining and troubleshooting our instruments. 

In addition, a few months back, she asked me how I enjoyed working there. I truly do enjoy it, and she said that she'd like to hire me after I finish school next spring. I mentioned that I was thinking about grad school and haven't given much thought yet about what I want to do after I graduate, and we agreed to revisit the topic in the summer. Now that it's summer and I have a better idea of what I'd like to do (no PhD degree - I'm likely going to take a year off and go back for a Master's, whether it's in business or chemistry), I'd like to revisit the topic and see if she's still able to hire me. Although there technically isn't a position open, she would be required to get approval to hire me (which I don't see being a large issue - there's no way she'd be able to do both jobs, and training another intern will take many weeks, if not months). I was wondering how to bring this up again, and would it be too soon to talk about an expected salary? I think it is, but I feel like knowing this information (whether I have a job security and what the salary will be) will help me be more financially smart as I prepare to head into my last year of school. Another intern who worked there for 2 years with a starting wage of $15/hr was given a starting salary of $55k/yr, which is pretty good in my opinion. 

My boss is pretty easy going and I know she'll be open to at least talk about the potential hire. I don't think she's fully in charge of my pay as an intern, but she's be the person to ask.

"chemistry, can you help me mix a cocktail?",8,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1495739194,True,"Not a chemist here. I am working on writing an article and making tonic water for gin and tonics. Basing my recipe from [this](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/11/diy-tonic-water-homemade-tonic-for-gin-recipe.html) recipe. Someone had mentioned to be careful with this recipe, as it higher than legal limits of quinine.... so I did the math, as I am curious.

I do know that doctors have prescribed much higher amounts of quinine than the amounts we are talking about. One of the more popular tonic recipes adds much more bark. I tried this with the recommended mix and am not dead, so I am pretty sure it is safe, but just want to know.

**Here is what I know:**

* The legal limit of quinine in tonic water is 83mg/L
* The recipe (linked to above), calls for 1 part tonic syrup and 4 parts soda water.
* It is estimated that cinchona bark is 5% quinine. 
* Recipe made a pint of syrup

**Here are my calculations**

* 2 tsp of bark, which comes to 6g of bark or 6000mg.
* If cinchona bark is 5% quinine, that would be 300mg in the pint IF it all extracted into the liquid.
* When mixed, it would be 300mg per 5 pints of tonic or 300mg per 2.36 Liters. 
* We end up with 127.12 mg/L, which IS above the legal limit.
* altering the original recipe to 1 part syrup and 6.5 water would get us there (.5 oz syrup and about 4.25 oz water) will get us to the mix that is legal. But is it needed?

**finally, the question**
 
My question is about the 5% of quinine. Is it safe to assume that not all 5% of that quinine will be imparted into the tonic, even with 65 minutes being boiled and seeped for that long? When I taste my tonic, it really doesn't taste as bitter as a traditional tonic. Is there a reasonable estimate I could make on the amount of quinine that CAN be extracted with the time involved, method of extraction, and the starting material (not powder… literally bark. See picture)?

Carbon Dioxide Emission Acceleration in Ground Coffee,0,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1495917409,True,"Hi all,

I am working on an experiment attempting to optimize the degassing process of coffee after it has been ground. I've done many experiments to determine what kinds of factors affect this phenomena the most, but where I come short is the actual knowledge of chemical processes taking place.

First of all, if anyone is a big coffee drinker or has general knowledge on coffee science, you should know that once coffee is roasted CO2 begins to release from the bean. When it is ground, you immediately lose some of this gas out of the grinder, and the grounds continue to release after, as well.

One experiment I have tried that has given me the biggest clue is connecting a closed container of coffee to a eudiometer. Leaving less head space of air above the coffee in the closed container results in less gas in the eudiometer. I know this gas is probably just air being displaced by the CO2 released from the coffee over time, but I see a larger reading in the eudiometer when I increase the size of my vessel while keeping the mass of coffee constant.

I have talked to a chemical engineer friend who believes the difference in partial pressure of the surrounding gas results in more or less diffusivity of the CO2 from the coffee depending on the type of gas. I have read some general studies that have stated something like Air>Nitrogen>Carbon Dioxide in terms of increasing rate of CO2 degassing. An inert gas like Nitrogen has been used the most in industry to flush through coffee because it prevent oxidization while allowing CO2 to release.

Does anyone have an explanation on the results I am seeing with the my experiment in a closed container and variable head space (air above coffee after sealing)? I have almost no background in chemistry, so I'll continue to do research if I can be pointed in the right direction.

Thank you!"

Question about an insoluble copper salt (I believe?),9,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1496010776,True,"I recently bought a distillation apparatus, and I decided to make some nitric acid as my first test of it, as it's a relatively simple reaction that I could keep under control without too much of an issue. To test the concentration of my final product after two distillations (one for the initial reaction and another for azeotropic concentration with temperature monitoring), I used a bit on an old copper pipe I had laying around. The normal reaction occurred with the nitrogen dioxide and copper (II) nitrate. 

I stopped it midway by taking the copper out and boiled off most of the water and nitric acid, and then introduced water (from the tap). I noticed that there was now a precipitate, however [much like the picture here](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-95bc2d72f9ffe528902a1e70c6738c31-c) in addition to the blue copper nitrate solution.

I figure that it is not copper nitrate as it is very soluble in water, but I do wonder what it is. Could the tap water have affected it? This also seems unlikely to me, as when I made copper (II) acetate a while back (without using tap water) with hydrogen peroxide and plain old household vinegar (~5% acetic acid), and I got a similar precipitate. 

Upon filtering off and drying out that strange precipitate from the nitric solution, I ended up with a powder looking very similar to [basic copper carbonate](https://digitalfire.com/4sight/images/oxides/ciptocytan.jpg). Is there any way besides the eye to identify the compound? Thanks for any help you can give!

So my question is, what should the pH of my water be to make sure that the pH of the final liquid soap will remain in the range of 5.2-6 like the bar is?

Copper Sulfate electrolysis: It's products and my basic experiments with path forward,8,11,False,False,False,chemistry,1496041528,True,"  So I have a very basic chemistry understanding, no degree but 4yrs working as a lab tech in the USN in nuclear chemistry, so I am just now starting to get into home chemistry. I am only doing this really just for the science and to see if I can and if it works so I know my product won't be perfect but I would like some advice on any miss steps or misunderstandings I'm having at this early stage. 

  Currently I am using a close to saturated solution of Copper Sulfate and electrolysing(is this even the right word?) it with a copper wire cathode and a carbon rod anode (from a dry cell battery). The carbon rod is deteriorating very quickly, as expected, and making a very black and dirty product. It is pretty easy to filter out the carbon with coffee filters and if I am understanding the process correctly, all that should be left is weak sulphuric acic which I can later clean up and concentrate. 

 My end goal is to make a decent sulphuric acid that I can then use the lead electrodes I cast (which btw was cool and fun do cast some metal as I have never done it before) to make a lead dioxide electrodes to use back in the initial electrolysis and make cleaner sulphuric acid. 

 My question, and what I could use advice in is if my theory or products are wrong or, if someone has done this before, how can I make it better/cleaner?

QUESTION: Aromaticity; why is it 4n+2? (More difficult than you'd think.),61,36,False,False,False,chemistry,1496092909,True,"Let me first unpack this question a bit:

Generally, when we learn about aromaticity, we are taught the 4n+2 rule for the number of pi electrons. When we draw the MO diagram for the pz orbitals, we see that if we only have a multiple of 4, we end up with two unpaired electrons between two degenerate pi energy states-- a biradical. We are taught that biradicals are bad (read: reactive), and hence need to be paired. This is how we rationalize 4n+2. 

Here is the question... Why is that the case? What makes pairing those electrons the most energetically favorable choice, when the simple act of pairing electrons costs energy? Additionally, what is it, fundamentally, that we perceive biradicals to be so reactive? Oxygen exists as a biradical and, while a good reagent for many reactions, would not be characterized as an unstable molecule."

I recently got a new roommate who is a Chem grad student, he seems like a nice enough guy (I'd met him a couple times in the past), but then something odd happened shorty after he moved in. Apparently homeland security approached my landlord to ask about my roommate because some chemicals went missing from his university that could be used to cook meth. I haven't brought this up to him but when I got home today the apartment did smell slightly odd (like cleaning solution) and he had the following setup in his room (he had left his door open) https://m.imgur.com/a/tt2l4. Not being a chemist I'm sure this could easily be some homework assignment but the fact that there is a bottle of drain opener seems fishy to me. I don't really feel comfortable going to him about this just in case it is the case but I also don't want to start a fuss over nothing, can anyone offer any insight as to what this could be?

At the end of the day there was nothing found belonging to his school nor any indications that he had them, the only thing from his university that he had were glassware that was being disposed of by the school. We were able to have a nice long talk the next day and he was exceptionally understanding and not angry at me for the misunderstanding, and promised not to do any other personal project at home. However as a cliffhanger to this thrilling tale while the fire Marshall was here they noticed some code violations that my landlord was hit with so now we're going to see if I will still have an apartment next week..."

Also, how does 4 courses per semester look on a transcript? I'm trying to find a lab to volunteer in for next year and for the entirety of my undergrad during my 4 course semesters. 

Any advice is much appreciated!
Thanks."

Question with carboxylic acid,16,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1496282223,True,"Hi everyone! 

I'm taking the GCE O levels this year and my teacher is going through organic chemistry.

I read the general formula of carboxylic acid and the formula of carboxylic acid seemed very weird to me.

My teacher told me that the carboxylic acid formula   was an exception and that the ""n"" for carbon had actually started from 0.

I would like to ask why is the formula 

CnH2n+1COOH

where n for carbon starts from 0

instead of this formula:

Cn-1H2n+1COOH 

where n can be the same number instead of complicating things?

I hope my question can be answered.

Thank you!"

Making Sulfuric acid from Copper Sulfate questions,4,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1496299125,True,"So I have successfully, I think, made my own Lead Dioxide electrode to use in this electrolysis as the anode. Which was a huge part for me because my last anode was carbon and it just was eaten, giving a dirty product

I got about 800 ml of clear, as I'm assuming, dilute sulfuric acid. When I tried to concentrate it I ran into the problem of a lot of ""bumping"". I boiled it down to about 200 ml but the random boiling was enough to start splashing out of my beaker so I stopped it.  I read that putting some crushed up porcelain can be uses as a good boiling chip. In the one previously mentioned I had put in some broken glass for the same purpose but it didn't seem to to anything. Near the end, my beaker was actually jumping across the hot plate I had it on and I would have to move it every few minutes. 

Well, my few questions are are such (after explaining my current situation) 

1 Once the 56g of Copper Sulfate(which I think is saturated in 1L or atleast what I added in my first batch) is done and clear, can I add another lets say 56g of copper sulfate and keep repeating the electrolysis in the same solution.   Will my product and the H2SO4 product compound? So if I keep adding more of the copper sulfate, as each solution clears up, will that mean I am making an equal concentration of H2SO4?

2)So my big problemm and what had limited me the most,  with boiling out and concentrating what i had was the knocking where there was no boiling for a second or two then it all happened at once . This ended up being why I had to quit my concentration of the acid. So I have read ceramic chips are really good for using as boiling chips. I am thinking of breaking up a coffee mug and using the chips. Is this a good idea?

Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated. I just this week learned how to calculate the morality of my product so I am still as novice as you can get :)"

Why are bioplastics better than petro-based plastics?,11,11,False,False,False,chemistry,1496408447,True,"I've been thinking about this recently, and it would be interesting to get some perspectives here. Bioplastics are of huge interest in chemistry, just like any other ""green"" topic. But it seems like it is taken for granted that bioplastics are good for the environment, and I am not sure why that is the case. 

If it just comes down to replacing a petrol based feedstock with a biobased feedstock for making polymers, then I don't think bio is inherently better. The end plastic will sit in a landfill either way, with the carbon sequestered in the plastic. Biodegradability is a separate topic. In a world that has switched over fully to renewable energy, I don't see why the majority of our materials can't still be petroleum based. You could mine fossil fuels using renewable energy, and no more of the carbon  would go into the atmosphere than farming the biofeedstocks using renewable energy. 

There are also other issues with bioplastics, such as taking up farm land for plastic instead of food, which hurts developing nations. Of course, there is a place for bioplastics which can use food waste, land that isn't suited for food crops, etc. But this is a limited percentage of farming. If you want to fully switch over, eventually you have to start compromising food crops. 

It makes sense to continue to develop bioplastic technology because giving the world a bigger toolbox for making materials is bound to increase efficiency. But I feel like in chemical journals and the media, bioplastics are automatically assumed to be better for the environment. 

I'd love to hear some perspectives about other factors I may not have considered. "

Denatonium Benzoate health effects in play mats (?),2,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1496549103,True,"Hello chemistry subreddit,

Iron Sulphate crystals turn white,7,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1496668633,True,"They turn white a couple of days after I take them out of the solution even if they are sealed with spray or nail polish. I've read that it's either because of heating (probably not), because of lack of water, or exposure to air. They turn white slower if I hold them in a container.

Is there any way to prevent this? Some kind of magic sealant or some other method that I could use, or should I just give up and grow some other crystal?"

Garage Inventor: Characterizing Iron Sulfate battery chemistry (1.0v) help request,9,8,False,False,False,chemistry,1496673171,True,"I've been working for the last four years on trying to develop a bulk, recyclable, cheap battery for third world applications (like keeping an LED lit through the night).  Additionally, I've been working on trying to find a battery chemistry that can use Bauxite residue as the cathode/anode material for batteries. This cell can easily use that residue to make a cheap, low voltage cell with a fair amount of power. I'm able to repeatably build it from the process below.

Sodium Polyacrylate is the stuff inside diapers and feminine hygiene products that acts to absorb up to 800X it's weight in water. Here, (I think) it's just acting as an ion conducting membrane.

You can follow my experiments here: https://www.facebook.com/Big-Attic-House-147402252134942/?ref=bookmarks

After many different avenues (mostly related to metal-air), I stumbled upon a fairly stable chemistry, but I'd like to figure out what's going on.

***

Step 1: Sodium Polyacrylate + KOH + water (makes a ""gel slime"")

Step 2: Mix Gel 1:1 with Iron Sulfate (turns a pretty blue/black)

Step 3: Insert into iron tube

Step 4: Insert graphite rod (pyrolytic graphite rod, new.) Have also used graphoil (same outcome), and copper sheet (0.2v lower cell voltage).

***

This is a ""discharged"" state... usually starting around 0.5v after construction.

The cell seems to charge at something like 1.5-1.6v (I'm still sneaking down to the correct voltage from 2.8v where I started), OCV is usually in the neighborhood of 1.04v sitting overnight. The largest plateau of work during output is aroudn 1.03v down to 0.99v Discharge seems to drop off rapidly around 0.85v.

I can run a 3.3v white LED through a boost convert (joule thief) all night on one cell... and can get it to produce 100mA of current for sustained periods.

If I use copper, It hangs out OCV in the 0.8v range, and discharges right around 0.75

Using Iron/Iron, I see a plateau around 1.2-0.9 for a few seconds, and then it drops to around 0.5v for a long time.. I haven't tried powering anything with it, just trying to characterize the difference.

What I *think* is happening:  I'm not sure what's going on in Steps 1 and 2.  I believe I'm forming FeS at the anode, which lowers the anode voltage by about 0.2v at pH 11 according to the FeS pourbaix. I see a tan color forming near the cathode in a pancake configuration - so I think what I'm doing is shuttling sulfur/sulfate ions around between the plates.  I do notice surface rust coloration on the mix (I had it in a mason jar) for the first centimeter or so.

There is no smell of sulfur when charging, even at 5v. 

I plan on a copper/goop/copper version with and without the iron sulfate (using copper sulfate) as well to see if it has comparable behavior.

Any assistance is appreciated.

Fe Pourbaix: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Pourbaix_Diagram_of_Iron.svg/1200px-Pourbaix_Diagram_of_Iron.svg.png


EDIT:

Think I figured it out ... Iron(II) sulfate FeSO4 throughout to mix is migrating to the anode to form FeS (pyrite) but still conductive, while the cathode is becoming Some form of Iron(III) sulfate Fe2(SO4)3, and Fe2O3 .. so oxygens are shuttled to the cathode to form rusts and higher sulfates, while Sulfur is heading south to coat the anode... during discharge it goes back to FeSO4. This explains lack of bubbling during charge, and general stability. It also means I could probably raise the overall voltage by using Manganese on the cathode the way Alkaline cells work... resulting something like 1.3v overall at pH 11, I think. That's a potential drop in replacement for NiMH!

Anyone have thoughts on my hypothesis?


EDIT 2:

Applied my MnO2 idea to a cell, also added a little Fe2O3 to the anode and a little in the cathode with K2SO4 and a little extra KOH.  I heard bubbling at 3v, none at 1.7v (probably just too little to hear), no smell of sulfur - OCV >1.4v .. I'm guessing 1.2 or 1.3 actual working voltage. YAY!

I'm calling it the ""Vulcan"" battery, because of the Iron and Sulfur content.


EDIT 3:

Looks like it's iron pyrite... and already patented:  https://www.google.com/patents/US20160020493?cl=en
by these fine folks: http://e-stonebatteries.com/web/ (which looks like an interesting startup). I can definitely say their project is viable ;)

Such is life!.. I've notice Sodium Acetate + Iron Acetate in place of the sulfates seems to work as well. At least I can say that idea was mine :)

I am currently trying to create lenses from PDMS [as was done here](https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-5-5-1626).  The basic idea is that they take a glass microscope slide, apply a small bead, place in an oven drop, drop side facing down, at 70°C for 15 minutes,  and the lens cures and becomes hard. Gravity pulls the silicone oil into a parabolic shape so that when its hard, you have a nice lens.

I wanted to do this as well, and when looking for where to buy PDMS, I found that I could easily buy ""Pure Silone oil"" from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/MicroLubrol-Silicone-Polydimethylsiloxane-centistokes-viscosity/dp/B00ZM36C98/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496831876&sr=8-1&keywords=Polydimethylsiloxane), which claimed to be pure PDMS. 

I ordered some and tried the experiment, but the silicone oil never hardened, regardless of curing time or tempurature. So the question is, are there different types of PDMS? Is silicone oil able to harden? Do I need to add a hardening agent?

Synthesis of NaCl + Na2So4 + H2O 18c (64f) PCM,9,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1496839702,True,"Hi All,

I'm attempting to DIY some PCM for a cooler vest so that I can stand to go outside. I'm fully aware I could buy these but the lack of information on how to DIY it (and paywalls for the research documentation) have inspired me to figure this out and post a how to for others. My background is not in chemistry so after several mostly failed attempts at making this I'm hoping someone with more knowledge / experience could aid in this.

**Sources of my information:**

http://www.eng.mie-u.ac.jp/research/activities/29/29_31.pdf
https://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/energy_studies/content/docs/FINAL_PAPERS/4B-4.pdf

So based on the first document,  Na2SO4+NaCl+H2O 37%+17%+46% by weight eutectic should form a PCM that melts at 18c. This is effectively Glauber's Salt (Na2So4 + 10H2O) + 17% NaCl.

**Successes so far:**

- Anahydrous Na2So4 -> Na2So4 + 10H2O crystals
- Mixed the 37%+17%+46% ratio together and got a salt cake that definitely hardens together / falls apart at the 64f threshold and exhibits the heating plateu. Unfortunately this is at most including 1/3 of the water it ought to be and so I'm thinking it is at most 1/3 of the potential latent heat of fusion.

**Current Thoughts:**

- Crush the Glauber's Salt (Na2So4 + 10H2O) Crystalls and mix them with the appropriate amount of NaCl. 
- Evaporate extra water off super saturated NaCl + Na2So4 solution. Note: Refrigerating a super saturated solution did not cause it to crystallize or precipitate.

**Questions:**

- ~~Will either of the methods above yield the results I'm looking for?~~

- ~~If not, how should I be going about this?~~

- ~~When melting, the documentation mentions that *Eutectic nearly always melts and freezes without segregation*. Just to confirm, does someone know if NaCl + Na2So4 + 10H2O melts without segregation / precipitate?~~

- ~~If it does precipitate, does anyone have suggestions or the steps necessary to mix this into a gelatin / Polyacrylamide thickened water saturated gel? My attempts with gelatin have been quite the failure. (And now I know I hate working with gelatin :P)~~

** Results **

**Update - Crushed Glauber's:** This appears to have worked well enough with mild heating (90ish F) to break up the Glauber's and mix in the NaCl. When it is ""melted"" it is a similar consistency to applesauce. Freezes rock solid. Very little water has escaped to the top of the PCM (And this may be due to poor precision on my part adding the NaCl).

**Update - Super saturated solution:** I had the thought to agitate the solution and put it in the freezer. Minutes later there were large crystals growing. It appears to also be the desired PCM, just with a lot of extra water present. In my few minutes playing with it it did not seem to work as well as the previous method.

Will post more observations as I have time to do more batches and do proper temperature tests on the current samples."
How can I prevent gold from electroplating onto steel alligator clips?,7,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1496846743,True,"Hey guys - I'm not normally the one who does any electroplating at my company, but my boss asked me to work on a project related to this and I wanted to see if I could come up with any other ways to help out while I'm doing it. My coworker plates gold onto wafers, and uses stainless steel alligator clips to attach to the wafer in the bath. They've had problems in the past with inconsistent plating, due to the clips drawing charge, and also wasting gold by plating the clips. 

They solved it somewhat by coating it with a paint to prevent the plating on most of the clip, but it's not perfect and I feel like there's a better solution. Any suggestions? Searching seems to mostly turn up information on electroplating from a hobby perspective. I'm wondering if maybe there's a different coating I can put on the clips so they don't get plated and don't have to be changed as often - maybe there's a way to still conduct current into the wafer, but that doesn't allow the plating?

Thanks!"

Literature on the subject suggests that an increase in the concentration of the electrolyte solution will increase the flow of current in the cell, hence allowing for more copper to be coated onto the nickel cathode.

Difference between energy levels will get smaller and smaller until it becomes smaller than an energy quant(a photon).
In harmonic oscillator this problem is solved by existence of dissociation energy which limits the number of energy states."

In an experiment I performed a melting point test on an unknown compound using a Mel-Temp apparatus and got 83-85C. The melting point of iodoacetic acid is 82-83C and the boiling point of m-nitrophenol is 96C.

I know impurities lower melting points so off that alone I would arrive at the conclusion that the unknown compound is m-nitrophenol. I have my doubts though because the mass of the crude compound was 0.41g however after recrystallization and vacuum filtration the mass of the sample was 0.53g. I was rushed for time and worry the vacuum filtration didn't get rid of all of the water in the sample.

Is water just like any other impurity (i.e. should lower melting point) or is water different? (raises melting point)"

Soxhlet extraction with density gradient,11,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1496944130,True,"Hi All - I've tried to search as much as I can on my own, but I've come up empty-handed.


I'm using a large soxhlet extraction apparatus to extract an organic compound using acetone. The issue I've run into is the solution is much more dense than the acetone. Because the solution is not well mixed, the most dense solution is taken into the siphon arm first, then as pure solvent is added, it does not extract nearly as much solute. [(Schematic)](http://imgur.com/a/XelNf) So by the time the reservoir is full, the liquid level in the siphon arm is not quite to the top of the bend. This means I have to open the apparatus and mix the reservoir, at which point the siphon drains as designed.


Has anyone run into this problem before? And if so is there anything that can be done to prevent this? After 3-4 extractions, the difference in densities is low enough that it will empty on it's own.

Reasons that I know of: - (If standard enthalpy change - then anything to do with states of products or reactants not being the same as what they would be in standard conditions) - Heat loss - Not accounting for mass of solid - When heating - difficult to measure change in temperature - Assuming the solvent used has the same specific heat capacity as water (4.18 Jg-1K-1) - Incomplete combustion - Heat not evenly distributed in water measured If there are others that I have either forgotten or don't know of, please inform me of these too please!

I'm going to be a senior chemistry major this fall. I know there are many other questions posted previously regarding GRE and grad school topics, however I was wondering if anyone would have some insight on a few questions I have. First of all, concerning graduate school, how should I find schools to consider applying to and/or narrow the list down to a shortlist? I am just starting my search and am not even entirely sure what kind of program to look for. I was advised to check out phds.org, but the site has not worked for me. Are there any other sites similar to this that anyone knows for me to get started? 
Secondly, regarding the Chemistry subject GRE, does anyone have advice on how to study and the timeframe of when to study? I have taken all of the classes that cover the material on the exam except for inorganic, which I will take in the fall. I have all of my textbooks and plan to go through them and my class notes, but are there any good online video sources that would help guide my studying? I have been told it isn't necessarily important to get a super high score on the Chemistry GRE, however I certainly plan to do some studying if I can. Also, does anyone know where to get more Chemistry practice tests or questions (other than the one posted on the ETS site)?
I plan to talk some of these things over with some professors that know me well at my university too, but I was just curious to see what other people had to say!

Tips for working with disulfides?,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1497053596,True,"My professor says sulfur compounds are tricky...
We mostly work with amine, amides, and carbonyls. But for the past two months have been working on a side-project involving a compound with two disulfide bonds. The reaction to synthesize this compound is very easy and has little room for error. Theoretically, it produces one side product which we would also like to isolate. But we cannot isolate anything... 

Im not sure if its due to our shitty purification techniques, or problem with analysis.

The reaction is very straight-forward and only requires a solvent(MeOH) and some time. We purify using silica gel columns. Analyze with ESI-MS. 

The side product(contains 1 disulfide) was the major ESI peak, with the target compounds(2 disulfides) protanated peak showing up very small. We just assumed ESI wasn't detecting our target cmpd very well. Separation was terrible. TLC's looked okay for separation but every fraction was a mess... Ran column twice and then prep TLC and it was all a mess.
So my professor has given up. But I hate to just quit a project. I have some old reactions saved that never got touched, I would like to revisit these and see this project through.

So...

Questions about electronic configuration,17,22,False,False,False,chemistry,1497098515,True,"Hi chemists!
I'm new to this way of writing electron configuration so please bear with me :]

My chemistry teacher told us that the electronic configuration (E.C.) of calcium is: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2

However scandium has an E.C. Written as 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d1 4s2 because the 3d orbital has been activated and thus 4s orbital has higher energy levels than 3d 

My question is why is mercury's (proton no:80) EC not written as 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 4p6  4d10 4f14 5s2 5p6 5d10 6s2

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p6 4d10 5s2 5p6 4f14 5d10 6s2.

Does this imply that 4f orbital has higher energy than 5p and 5s orbital even if they were activated?

Also how does Carbon Monoxide have 3 covalent bonds? Doesn't the electron repel each other thus carbon monoxide structure cannot exist?


Edit: sorry! I'm extremely weak at chemistry :c 
I didn't know the term activated orbitals didn't exist. 
what I meant by activated was that the orbital would exist if an electron enters that orbital

I think this type of behaviour is irresponsible. Do you?,43,96,False,False,False,chemistry,1497152875,True,"Hi,

I just stumbled upon ""The King of Random"" on YouTube and I have to say I'm a bit worried. His audience seems to be mainly kids and young adolescents. He does all sorts of ""experiments"" which are nothing more than just playing around with fire and/or explosives and/or liquid nitrogen and/org food. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur1zoM1vTU) for an example.

His videos never start with disclaimers and warnings, he sprinkles a couple of warnings here and there during videos. He often works inside houses and his safety precautions seem a bit ridiculous and reckless. One example is he uses a blowtorch with latex gloves that could easily melt on his fingers.

The guy has 8.1 million followers on YT and I repeat that his audience seems to be mostly kids. He seems like a cool guy but his ""experiments"" (nothing remotely scientific from what I gather) and the way he conducts them seem just too reckless for his intended audience.

Am I overreacting? He really hit a nerve."
The composition of Pitchblende in both elements and compounds,1,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1497153354,True,"Back in middle school / junior high, I attempted to figure out, for a research project on Marie Curie, the rough element composition of 1 metric ton of pitchblende.  I assumed it to be pure Uranium originally.  I used the age of the Earth as a starting point for the Uranium decay chain.  Most recently, I was watching a TV show where Marie Curie came up.  I thought I should go back and retry my calculations since I now know more.  I figured I should ask first how one would attack this problem.  I will be starting with the same amount of pitchblende, 1 metric ton.  I going to assume that the pitchblende is just UO2 for simplicity sake.

I would also like to know what compounds are generated with each decay, if possible.

My proposed method:

1. Figure out percent composition of the pitchblende

2. Figure out the amount of each Uranium isotope

3. Calculate the amount remaining using their half-life following the appropriate decay chains

I need some thermocouple help,10,14,False,False,False,chemistry,1497224787,True,"Hello again everyone!

I bought a digital thermometer [(68022 II visible here)](https://www.amazon.com/Signstek-Channel-Digital-Thermometer-Thermocouple/dp/B00FFYEPVQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497224414&sr=8-1&keywords=digital+thermometer+type+k+microprocessor) for use in my distillation apparatus, and so far it has done very well measuring accurate high temperatures. The problem I find is with the thermocouples. Most of the ones that you can find online, such as the ones provided by the link above with the thermometer, are simply small metal (of some sort?) wire or stainless steel. These items have no temperature problems, but are not chemically resistant by any means, especially for simple reactions like the synthesis of nitric acid.

So, given that this k-type thermocouple sensor is so weak chemically, I decided to look into Teflon alternatives. [This is one of the ones I am leaning towards, as it is generally inexpensive.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/USA-Portable-K-Type-Teflon-Thermocouple-Sensor-Probe-Cable-E0Xc-NEW/291787644532?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D41375%26meid%3Daf51ce978ec346ef9c87d098f1e805b8%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D262480152380). The issue is, though, that although this one is labeled ""k-type,"" it has a red and blue attachment for the thermometer device rather than the yellow one. Now, this might be a rookie mistake as I'm used to glass thermometers rather than the digital ones, but how are they both the same type? The red and blue one will not fit into my digital thermometer. Do I need to remove the external attachments of them and thread the wires into the yellow casing of the other thermocouples (which I have saved)?

Hopefully this isn't too vague and someone who has more experience than me with these things can help me out. Thanks as always for answering my menial questions!"

First of all I would like to apologize sincerely if this post does not belong here, but 

I come from a very mixed background that I want to leave behind here where I live(Turkey). I always had a passion in me to learn, to study, to know and to discover and I've always been interested in biochemistry and chemistry in general. I did not really have the best upbringing but I somehow managed to get into one of the best highschools in Turkey after middle school (you can get into highschools with different points that you earn in an exam that you take at the end of your 8th grade). After that I had to work(as I did in my middle school, albeit to a lesser degree) and did not really care about my grades, I was in a substantially different state of mind and did not care about sciences in any way. This is my last year of highschool and in turkey you, much like how we do to get into highschools, have to have an exam that is on about the subjects you were supposed to learn in the first 2 years of high school, and other ones that are focused on the last 2 years but on various subjects(LYS Chemistry, LYS History etc.). Of course I do not have the slightest of idea what subjects those exams are composed of, that is why I will study relentlessly this year to make it to these exams. I am confident of what I can do, I couldn't study, but I always passed my classes, read books in my free times and tried to learn more whenever I can.

I want to be a researcher, I want to partake in humans quest to understand nature and advance the technology we currently use. I want to be a scientist. I will try to do my best to achieve these dreams that I have.

What I need is some guidance, I live in Turkey right now but I have to be out in at least Germany to get an education I need. To do that I will have to get accepted into a college here in Turkey, a chemistry faculty first to then get into Germany. You can get into any college in Germany if you have been accepted into a university with the same major in Turkey. And the costs of living there is not that much, I have done some research and found out that I can easily rent a house and make a living doing what I do currently.

But after getting into the college there, how will I go on to be able to do research, to discover stuff, write papers, and all? I just can't seem to make connections in how i would be able to make it, the steps that I have to take... 

TL;DR:

What I am asking is ""how to be a chemist doing science stuff"" I suppose. I would greatly appreciate any word of advice."

Data management/organization,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1497269507,True,"Hey guys,

I'm currently doing my PhD since about 6 months. I realized today that I don't really have an effective system in place to keep my research data together and have it accessible easily at all times.

What I could do is just collect GCs, NMRs, Papers, ... in different folders (analog as well as digital). However that means that my train of thought for doing certain experiments is basically spread over a couple of folders and it might be difficult to understand in a year why exactly one experiment was made.
All the papers I read are neatly organized in Mendeley so far. I'd like to have a system which basically references connected documents. In a way like:
Opening the NMR file and seeing the corresponding GC and notes, conclusions I drew from it. The best would be if it would be system wide, meaning also when I look at my notes I get the referenced NMR, GCs, whatever...

Does anyone has figured out an intelligent way to do so?"

For bulk electrolysis, however, in which the reduced/oxidized analyte will be detected with a different physical technique (such as a UV visible kinetic scan) is the electrode choice important? for example could I just as easily use a graphite rod for both electrodes rather than using, say, a Pt disk working and Pt wire counter?

Assume that integration time of each data point via the auxiliary physical technique is around 1 second to help average any erratic behaviors. 

Thanks! "

I'm usually pretty good with saving my data and backing up my work. One of the post docs I work with however told me a story of someone (we'll call her B) who like me was good at backing up their data. 

Long story short this B would write up her results each week, save a copy locally and then save a copy to an external drive (along with a weekly backup of the entire computer). B would also email their supervisor with a weekly report, an abridged version of their write up. 

One day B was walking to the bus stop, it had been raining heavily for a few days and B slipped on a patch of mud landing flat on her back breaking her computer and hard drive, B was fine and only bruised her ego. 

3.5 years of work gone! 

Thankfully B was able to spend the next few weeks scouring through emails, instrument systems and some old thumb drives and recovered most of her work. While it was no huge setback for B it just goes to show that you can never be too careful. 

The moral of the story is that you should have multiple backups! So this is a friendly reminder to back up your data to an external hard drive and setup a cloud backup too if you can!

I was expecting lanthanide oxides to be basic, as is the case with all metal oxides, but I can't seem to find confirmation of this online. Also, if they are indeed basic, can someone tell me how basic they are, with relevant sources?

Rubiks Cubes and Chemistry? [Help!],12,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1497416033,True,"Im sure you are unaware of what ""thecubicle.us"" is. Its a website where proffessional rubiks cubes are sold, among other things. There is a department called ""Cubicle Labs"" where they use science to make rubiks cubes turn better. You see, when a rubiks cube has softer, more rubbery plastic, it has a nicer turning feel. Usually, this feeling is achieved by breaking in the cube, or using it extensively, but the ""Cubicle Labs"" has been doing something called ""Boron-22"". This is where they soak the pieces of a rubiks cube in a boron compound to simulate a broken in, softer feel. This has not been released to the public, but thecubicle.us has sent some boron treated cubes to select individuals to build up hype for this new innovation. Here is one of the videoes.
https://youtu.be/sJMUVLVJkaM. 
This is an intern at thecubicle.us discussing the new cubes. 

The man responsible for the product, Chris Tran, has uploaded a video discussing the boron-22. Here it is: 
https://youtu.be/zIF1-UGQmBI. Watch before continuing the thread. I will be refrencing it heavily. 
I know nothing about chemistry, but I learn quickly, and I decided to do my homework on chemistry, and I came up with this: The Butadiene in the ABS plastic controls the hardness and softness in the cubes. If I introduce the ABS plastic to Borane tetrahydrofuran, it should Hydroxylate (?) the Butadiene in the ABS to make it more rubbery, and (presumably) softer. BUT (!!!!!) Borane tetrahydrofuran reacts terribly to oxygen, and if ingested leads to horrid consequences. Which doesnt make sense, as in this video: https://youtu.be/U1XAJR8rqB, you can clearly see the boron treatment in a normal, oxygen rich enviornment, meaning that I found the wrong boron compound. Which brings me to my next question: What boron compound makes the butadiene in ABS plastic more rubbery/soft? "

Cyclic voltammetry unwanted peaks,6,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1497453437,True,"I'm trying to do cylic voltammetry, but I'm having trouble with unwanted peaks while testing the electrolyte solution. Attached is a quickly made origin plot to show what the peak looks like (it's at ~-1.0V). I'm expecting no peaks when testing the electrolyte except the Fc/Fc+ peaks.

http://imgur.com/a/3OaHS

I'm using distilled DCM and 0.1M Bu4npf6 as the salt, sweeping from -2.2V to 1.3V starting in the negative direction at 0.1V/s. Using different distilled DCM doesn't affect the peak. The attached voltammorgram used a large amount of Fc/Fc+, much more than we normally use, but the amount of Fc/Fc+ doesn't affect the unwanted peaks. Nitrogen is bubbled into the electrolyte solution for several minutes before taking data.


The setup I'm using is a glassy carbon disk as the working electrode, and two platinum wires as the reference and pseudo-reference electrodes. The glassy carbon electrode is usually cleaned by rinsing with acetone/DI water, and polishing with 0.3 micron polishing powder on a felt pad for a few minutes, and then briefly sonicating in acetone. The platinum electrodes are usually cleaned by rinsing with acetone and then flame drying with a bunsen burner. All glassware is cleaned with aqua regia, and then rinsed with DI water and acetone. The cap is washed with acetone and DI water. The glassware and cap are then dried in an oven before use. I also recently cleaned the glassy carbon electrode by cycling from -1.2 to 1.2 V 50mV/s in 0.1M sulfuric acid for about an hour, but this didn't seem to affect the peak. I also used a second glassy carbon electrode but still saw the same peak


Despite thoroughly cleaning the glassware, electrodes, and changing the solvent and glassy carbon electrode, I still see the same peak while testing the electrolyte solution. Does anyone know what might be causing it? Thanks!"

Unsafe Laboratory Environment,8,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1497464282,True,"Hello. I am new to this forum. Actually, I am kind of new to Reddit so here goes with my first post.

I wanted to ask you guys for help concerning the safety of the lab environment I am currently working in. I am a university student and am taking summer courses, one of which is this lab. Normally, all buildings are well ventilated and temperatures are anywhere between 16°C (~61°F) to 22°C (~72°F). However, this lab seems to only have ventilation to the outdoors, so in other words, the range is bumped up from 28°C (~83°F) to 32°C (90°C).

Now, I am built a bit big and prefer cool areas, however the heat seems to effect everyone else. We sometimes remove our goggles (extremely unsafe) to wipe our eyes from sweat (even less safe). In addition to that, I live in the Middle East and some of my lab partners may be fasting in Ramadan, and although it is normal to have work, it is very difficult to fast with such heat and energy spent in the lab. The concern here is that if a person is fasting and is bearing through the heat, it will be quite difficult to focus on the experiment. 

On a side note, isn't room temperature supposed to be between 20°C to 25°C? So wouldn't all of our experiments be a bit off?

Anyways, I could use some help composing a complaint email to the university concerning this issue. Any input at all would be appreciated, and links are even more appreciated. So far, I've only found one [link](http://www.dehs.umn.edu/iaq_tempstandards.htm). 

Thanks in advance.

* How good (or bad) is the Empower software?  My last copy I used was in grad school and I'm pretty sure it was a Win 3.0 machine.
* Has anyone used the QDa detector?  From my reading, it sounds like a mini, single pole quad.  How far off is that assessment?  Is it actually useful?
* Does anyone use the 21 CFR 11 compliant version of the either software packages?  How good or bad (i.e. annoying) are they?
* Has anyone used the RI detector for the Altus system, we may add that on in addition to the PDA?
* Does either model have or use a multi-column install valve, so that with the click of a button, you can change columns?
* Does either have an autosampler with in-line autodilution for standards?  We're a very high throughput lab and would pay lots of money for this?
* If we buy two, one will be a dedicated method development instrument.  Has anyone used the multisolvent blending capability in the Altus?  How well does it work?  Is it really useful, or is it just a marketing gimmick?

Question about chemistry entertainment,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1497649345,True,"I didn't know what to title this post. I have been making chemistry videos for awhile now, and that's all fine and dandy, but I want some ways to pad out my content.

The first being a crowd funded thing like most content creators have. However, I'm not making videos for money, and this makes me feel a tad sleezy. Also my base isn't large enough to Warrent a crowd funded thing.



The second, and more radical, idea is to set up a chemistry live stream, where viewers could watch chemical reactions in real time, and I could answer questions about it, or chemistry questions in general.

Berkley Chem Graduate Program,27,18,False,False,False,chemistry,1497656771,True,"Hey all,

I am a rising senior at UNC-Chapel Hill currently major in BS Chemistry. I have worked in an analytical lab since my freshman year.

I have had the honor to second author* a paper back in the first semester of my sophomore year. In addition, I will be coauthoring a second paper hopefully in the upcoming school year.

My interest is in organic/organometallic green chemistry. I in fact have a few PIs in mind. 

My question is how can I better prepare myself? Should I reach out to the PIs now?

The Zarthian Memorial to Earth,9,14,False,False,False,chemistry,1497662758,True,"This is a chemistry and physics problem.

A peaceful, alien expedition from Zarth arrived in the vicinity of Mars.  Just then, a spaceship from the planet Zim attacked the Zarthians.  But Captain Jones from Earth flew into the fight with his spaceship and saved the Zarthians.  The Zarthians were so grateful that they constructed a Memorial to Earth consisting of a spherical mass (called Body 1) of a pure, non-radioactive element composed of a single isotope of that element.  The ore from Earth to create Body 1 was chemically smelted to produce the element.  Body 1 contains an empty spherical space concentric with the outer sphere of Body 1, and that space has a radius less than half that of Body 1.  The Zarthians then created Body 2 made out of pure Iridium.  The radius of Body 2 is 1% of the radius of Body 1.  Body 1 was embossed with a map of Earth, and Body 2 was embossed with a map of Zarth.  Body 2 was placed in a circular orbit around Body 1 so that the distance from the outer surface of Body 1 to the center of Body 2 was twice the radius of Body 2.  The period of orbit of Body 2 about Body 1 is exactly 1 hour.  The monument was placed at the Lagrange point beyond Earth from the Sun.  A camera records an image of the monument as Body 2 orbits Body 1 and is shown on Earth TV.  Such is the construction of the Zarthian Monument to Earth.

Chemistry graduate deciding on a career path,3,8,False,False,False,chemistry,1497702857,True,"Hi everyone,
I graduated with a bachelors in Chemistry (3 years) in 2016 from the University of Cambridge and I've since been working in a graduate job in London.
I've become particularly disappointed with the work that I do. It is nothing more than glorified data entry and would not set me up for a career outside of this company in the future. For these reasons, I'm looking at various career paths. I admit that I enjoyed studying science, however I heard stories about the lack of job opportunities in Chemistry (I'm from the UK) so I backed out of a masters and a PhD.
I'm now in a situation where I'm thinking about going to back to university, but I have no idea what to do as I'm worried about career prospects. I have the option to study a masters in computer science, this would act as a conversion course and would teach C++ etc. This seems like a good option considering the number of jobs available in the technology sector. However, It would cost 15k and I would need to leave my job (plus I have no formal experience in programming). In addition, I feel like I would only be a competent programmer and not some genius like the Harvard and Oxbridge Compscis/Mathematicians.
There's also the option of volunteering for a couple of years and attending medical school.
It's a shame science doesn't have the careers like some other fields. I see some people strike gold and become patent attorneys etc But is it worth risking doing a PhD when the chance of getting one of those jobs is so small?

Are there any areas of chemistry that promising job prospects in the future?

I made a webapp for formatting lab plates into tables,0,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1497715749,True,"I made a [webapp](http://plateyplatey.com) for firefox/chrome browsers. The source code for the app is [here](https://github.com/AdamK117/plateyplatey-frontend) and [here](https://github.com/AdamK117/plateyplatey-server). A blog post explaining in detail why I made it is [here](http://localhost:4000/programming/2016/10/18/platey-platey.html).

Most scientific software packages (plotting packages, etc.) tend to take data in a standard table layout. Most lab plates are arranged in a grid, which is *similar* to a table. However, data arranged in a grid is harder to plot and aggregate.

Translating between a nice table layout and grids--which is ultimately what will happen in the lab--used to be such a source of confusion for me in the lab. I'd do the classic mental juggling act of ""ok so I'm putting 500 uL of water into D4 and, ok, there's D4 on the plate, how much water again?"" which, because I'm a simple person, led to a lot of triple checking. To get around that, I made all kinds of wierd excel spreadsheets that translated between two layouts. 

There came a point when enough was enough. The problem frustrated me enough to motivate me to make a webapp that translates between the two forms a bit easier (see [link](http://www.plateplatey.com)). It's in a bit of a prototype phase, but it essentially lets users click wells, rows, columns, etc. on a variety of plate layouts (they're programmable, if you want me to add more). After you're done, you can export the nice table layout to a CSV file and do the finishing touches in excel.

(I wasn't sure what the best subreddit for this was. I'm a chemist, so I defaulted to /r/chemistry, but biochemists also use plates *a lot*)."

A Cool Undergraduate Experiment in Photochromism...,6,19,False,False,False,chemistry,1497754630,True,"Short preface here: This whole post might get a little long, but it's something interesting for anyone looking for a neat and easy experiment. r/chemistry is home to people ranging from high school students to experienced PhD holders, but my goal with most material is to make it presentable to any audience. If you have taken some undergraduate chemistry/physics this experiment is inherently a lot more accessible due to an understanding of how light works (and you may be able to zoom past some beginning parts here), but I am going to try to present this information at a pretty basic level so that most may understand and enjoy – it is very cool! I would love to talk more about the experiment with anyone. Feel free to skip to the very end for a tl;dr. 

 


So, the first issue to handle: what is photochromism? Photochromism is the ability of a substance to change between two different states of absorption upon activation with electromagnetic radiation. It sounds a little complex, but most people see this phenomenon quite often (in transition lenses of glasses, for example). Let’s break it down a little..

 


[Photochromism at work.](http://imgur.com/a/7LzZm)^1

 


The picture above, for anyone who may not know, shows an absorption spectrum. The peaks on the absorption spectrum (A is gray here, B is red) show what wavelength of light is being absorbed by a particular substance.

 


[All wavelengths of light are somewhere on the electromagnetic spectrum.](http://imgur.com/a/lWJd3)

 


We only see that tiny portion of visible light in the middle. The diagram shows how wavelength corresponds to our different classifications of light. The wavelength of light absorbed by something (in this case, I’m talking about some specific dyes, but we will get to that later) directly correlates to the color that we see. So, if something is absorbing certain wavelengths of light, we see whatever wavelengths are left over. Here is a really simple explanation:

 


[Colors yayyy]( http://imgur.com/a/BAUNb)^2

 


If orange light is being absorbed, we get something that is blue in color. So, your blue Gatorade is absorbing orange light, and that’s why it looks blue. That’s oversimplifying a bit (EVERYTHING in chemistry is oversimplified a bit), but basically that is what’s going on here. Returning, then, to the absorption spectrum in the first link: at point A, a dye is absorbing ultraviolet light, and is therefore completely colorless. At point B, a dye is absorbing colored light, and probably appears reddish. There are many chemical reactions where a color change is observed, but in the case of photochromism, nothing is added to cause the color change **BUT LIGHT**. In other words, A was sitting there minding its own colorless business, but upon being hit by light it suddenly changed to being colored B (changing from A to B on the spectrum!). Not only that, but after B is removed from light, it often returns to A! How is this possible???

 


[Here is what happens to a bunch of different organic molecules when they are hit with light.]( http://imgur.com/a/o1SeG)^1

 


The energy provided from light is enough to stimulate a change within the molecule itself. Seen in the diagram above are rearrangements, cis/trans isomerizations, heterolytic bond cleavages, etc. (essentially, changes in shapes or connections within the molecules). Once the stimulant is gone, the molecules gradually (or not so gradually) return to their original state. I did a good amount of research on this phenomenon in a class of compounds known as naphthopyrans, which have been studied quite comprehensively over the past thirty years or so. In particular, I focused on understanding a study done called “Photochromism of 2H-Naptho[1,2-b]pyrans; A Spectroscopic Investigation”^3. It is very cool and I would encourage checking it out, but it’s likely not going to be performed in an undergraduate laboratory.

 


**So, after reading about this research, I went digging for an experiment I could perform with limited resources in an undergraduate laboratory.** I got some great ideas online, in particular from the Journal of Chemistry Education^5, but it turns out that photochromic dyes are expensive as all get-out. I was lucky enough to stumble across an experiment in a huge collection published in 1992 that used an inexpensive dye I had not realized was photochromic: **malachite green**.^4
I put my own twist on their experiment with the help of J. Chem. Ed. Malachite green is sold as an oxalate salt (lucky for me, we had some on hand). For this experiment to work best, the malachite green is dissolved in methanol. Roughly 0.01 grams of malachite green were dissolved in 50 mL of methanol. This solution alone is not photochromic. HOWEVER, a complex between a malachite green ion and hydroxide ion is photochromic.

 


[This complex is the left side of this reaction. In the complexed form, the malachite green solution becomes completely colorless. When exposed to ultraviolet light, the bond between the oxygen and the malachite green is cleaved, causing it to become colored again! Same thing as the transformation between A and B discussed earlier.]( http://imgur.com/a/RzfMp)^4

 


Now, creating the colorless form proved to be a bit tricky. Dissolved in methanol alone, the malachite green ion you see on the right side of the equilibrium above is present (and it is a pretty green color!). I added sodium hydroxide to force the formation of the complex on the left side of the equilibrium, but adding too much sodium hydroxide botches the whole thing, and the photochromic reaction never occurs. To solve this, I did not create a completely colorless solution. Instead, I added 5-10 drops of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide qualitatively to produce an almost colorless solution – this made it much easier for the photochromic reaction to occur. 

 


[Here is the almost colorless solution.](http://imgur.com/a/TMrdQ)

 


The beaker labeled “C2” would become my experimental solution, and that labeled “C1” was used as a reference. I exposed C2 to 254 nm light for one minute.

 


[Here is what happened.](http://imgur.com/a/VlNm6)

 


In my opinion, that is **awesome.** Proving that a photochromic reaction would actually occur was a cool experiment in and of itself. In my experiment, I attempted to observe photochromism using methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, DMSO, and water. The return reaction is easy to evaluate simply in terms of time. By eye, any student can record how long it takes for the irradiated sample to match the color of the reference – this can differ heavily in terms of solvent.

 


Luckily for me, I had some instrumentation with which to study the return reaction from colored to colorless. Using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer, I measured the change in absorbance over time as the malachite green returned from colored to nearly colorless.

 


[The absorption over time as seen on the spectrophotometer…](http://imgur.com/a/NIyJH)

 


[And as seen graphically.](http://imgur.com/a/iXadN)

 


This allowed for an evaluation of the kinetics of the experiment in terms that were not just relative to varying solvents. To add an additional layer for examination, I then varied the temperature of the reaction. I held the temperature of C2 at 0 degrees Celsius, and froze the block that holds the cuvette within the spectrophotometer to keep it as close to a constant temperature as possible (not perfect, but the best I could do). 

 


[Predictably, the return reaction occurred much more slowly.](http://imgur.com/a/WVRqV)

 


Without delving into the results too much, this allowed for more kinetic evaluation, plus varying temperature allowed for an evaluation of energy of activation of the reaction. Because this is already so long, I am not going to include many results beyond stating what was possible to evaluate. However, I would be happy to discuss in more detail with anyone interested.

 


**TL;DR**

 


Give this a shot in an undergraduate lab! I would be happy to share my procedural steps as a list to anyone who is interested. The photochromic reaction of malachite green is super easy to stimulate, and cool to observe. Results can be evaluated in terms of solvent effect, kinetics, energy of activation, and I’m sure much, much more depending on what you have at your fingertips. Go learn more about photochromism. Cool chemistry!!!!

I live in a country where the school system is very different to most of the world. High school starts at 12 and ends when you are 18 years old. You start in first year of high school and end in 6th year. I'm in the 4th year of high school right now (should be in fifth but i had to do my year twice). I plan on taking chemistry next year. This means i will have everything (maths, geography, languages, sciences,...) but it will focus on chemistry (4H organic, 4H experimental, 6h analytical) I can't choose how much of what i have but this should prepare you for university level chemistry.

I want to make my high school easier since its pretty hard here and i really have a passion for chemistry. After my exams i will have 2 months summer break and i want to learn as much as possible about chemistry.

I don't know much at all about chemistry i guess. I know
* Periodic table and how to use it
* chemical reactions (like dissociation,Precipitation,..)
* And the last thing i learned is calculating molecular mass.

**Questions:**

* Where do i start? Do you guys know any books i could buy to get me started? I'm a pretty fast learner especially when things interest me. Or any websites? Money isn't really a problem so rather a good quality online learning source then something free and not as good.

* What branch of chemistry do you think i would enjoy most? (Not that this matters in the slightest since i'm only 17 and don't plan on specializing in anything until i am older or in uni, it is just out of pure curiosity.) i don't enjoy physics (atleast not on the level i learn it at the moment which is very very low) but i like the idea of quantum mechanics, Q physics and Q chemistry. Chemistry>maths>biology>physics. I am pretty interested in mind-altering drugs and medicine too.

I really appreciate any input thank you!"

Should I contact HR over my boss's response to getting air conditioning in a lab.,99,134,False,False,False,chemistry,1497805834,True,"So my lab is not air conditioned we have a fairly large oven that is typically running at about 100C but puts out a lot of heat into the room. There is no noticeable air flow in the lab because there is only one local exhaust fan. The need for a fume hood or extreme exhaust ventilation is not present because we work with non-hazardous, non-volatile materials. Also, the materials we are working with do not need to be in a climate controlled environment

Typically the average working temperature in the lab is around 36.7C while the ovens are running all day. In addition to this we have to have lab coats and long sleeve shirts on as a company policy. Recently I approached my boss about getting AC in the lab because I was having difficulties working in the excessive heat. His response to me was ""Toughen up, it gets more hot and humidd than this in India and they are just fine."" 

I was told that I shouldn't bring the issue of AC up with HR, but rather I should bring up my boss's response to my request for air conditioning in our lab on the grounds of the comments being 'racist' since we are in America and not India. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I Need Colloidal Nanoparticle/UV-Vis Spec Help,4,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1497895729,True,"Hi there, so I made some colloidal gold nanoparticles using two different reduction methods. The first, sodium citrate stabilized, results in a particle size of 20 nm. The second, sodium borohydride stabilized, results in a particle size of 10 nm (or so i've read).  I then divided each method's solution into 3 samples. The first (of each method) was left alone. In the second NaCl aggregate was added.  In the third, Ethanol aggregate was added. Then I took 'em all to the UV-Vis expecting the smaller nanoparticles to have a λmax lower than larger particles. I based that expectation off of Mie's solution to maxwell equations for light scattering. The data shows the opposite though.  The plasmon peak for the larger particles is at ~520 nm for all  and the plasmon peak for the smaller particles is around 530 for all. I also know that colloidal gold is sensitive to aggregates. So i expected changing the aggregate to have more than a few nanometer effect on λmax. Anyone know have any ideas on what's going on? I should add that I'm not especially confident in my sodium borohydride synthesis. I didn't quite get a deep red color that i was expecting, so maybe something is fucky.

I'm wrapping up my associates in chemistry, and looking to transfer to a 4 year to finish my B.S. In chem. 

I got in to chemistry because I needed to pick a career path, liked chemistry, and I was pretty good at it too, to the point where fellow students who were on my half of the lab room would ask me for help with labs. 
I liked the idea of being able to make explosives and drugs, but as I progressed, I learned those are both generally unsafe ideas, and certain fields have a higher cancer risk. 

I like the idea of analytical stuff, such as running mass spec or chromatography, and I like doing stuff in an actual lab. 
I don't like the idea of failing many times while finally making a breakthrough, which is what I'm assuming research is. 

I also have very little work experience in chemical industry, which is probably relevant. 


Main point is I remember hearing chemistry is a good degree to get because it's good money with a good job market. 
But now I'm starting to hear people are lucky to score a decent job, and I'm wondering if I might be better off just taking my associates and finding a technician type job.

A few notes:

* I've got a background in warehousing for a bit and would prefer to stay away from anything alphabetised, and rather have a series of containers on a shelf in each cabinet which are all labeled (so you might have Corrosive Cabinet > Top Shelf > Tray B as a location)
* We're a total synthesis group and have like 1500 unique chemicals atm (lol send help) 
* ChemInventory offers the use of barcodes to assign to each chemical, have people used these before? How has it worked? I'm hopeful that it may help in the future with auditing/stocktake because you can pick a location and confirm everything that is there quickly
* At the moment the largest issue we have is just the time it takes to find anything, so the number 1 aim is to improve the speed at which we can locate the needed chemicals for a reaction

I've always wanted to teach, while I was at secondary school I was convinced I wanted to teach secondary school chemistry but after coming to university I'm pretty sure I'd rather be teaching at a uni (probably not the first person to do this). I see a lot of my lecturers do research on the side at the university, and basically I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I want to do, I'm absolutely certain I want to do something that involves teaching and being able to do research at my own level at the same time just seems like ""the dream"".

I'm aware that generally teaching positions aren't the best payed jobs in existence but I would take a job I enjoyed over a better salary any day.

My question basically comes down to: Is it realistic to do my degree, a masters, a PhD and then go straight (or at least as soon as possible) into lecturing/research at the same time? Will any universities hire me without some research experience myself? Am I aiming for something that isn't realistically achievable?

Thanks for any responses in advance :) I'll answer as soon as I can."

Confusions about MV2+ and quenching studies,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1497978201,True,"This shall be a bit of a long winded post, so please bear with me

My first issue is a bit trivial; I need to make a hexafluorophosphate salt out of a methyl viologen dichloride salt (as received from Sigma Aldrich) so that I can dissolve it in acetonitrile; having had no experience of this kind so far, I am wondering what might be a good way to go about this? Do I just add HPF6 to an aqueous solution of the chloride salt in a beaker and I'll get the precipitate out?

My second issue is completely different; I'm trying to isolate quenchers for a complex which has a rather low excited state lifetime (<10 ns). The idea is to extract out the biomolecular quenching rate constant, and owing to the extremely low lifetime, the quencher concentrations needed are very high (think ~3M). I've been wondering that, at such high concentrations, do I need to correct for absorbance by the quencher even if it doesn't have an appreciable extinction coefficient at the excitation wavelength? Because this absorbance would result in diminished fluorescence anyway, and therefore show more inflated quenching than what's really occurring?

So far in my experiments I had been maintaining an absorbance of around ~0.05 for the complex so as to avoid complications with self-reabsorbance of fluorescence. I did this by taking the quencher+acetonitrile as reference. Given I did this however, I don't quite have the ""total"" absorbance of the solution; but I could always redo those by making new stock solutions of the quenchers with the same concentration and then recording their absorbances against acetonitrile (which is my solvent).

I'm unsure as to why this is, I've attempted using the parent compound (2-nitrofluorene) and found good levels of success with the non-alkylated compound, I've tried multiple solvents (DCM, DCE, Nitrobenzene) for both, with both being very soluble in each of these solvents and tried heating in increments of 10 degrees (from room temp and 40C - 90C), I've asked colleagues to attempt this reaction also and they've found no luck.  

This is especially unusual as I could understand the nitro group reducing reactivity however the alkyl chains theoretically exist outside the aromatic system, belonging to an sp3 carbon. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to the lack of reactivity? (alkyl chains vary from methyl to hexyl) These compounds have been successfully acylated in many papers and I can't seem to repeat any of their methods (I hope I'm not just a terrible chemist) I would acylate then alkylate however the acyl groups protons are of similar pka to the sp3 carbon in fluorene

Both times, the demos were plagued with equipment issues. 

The first demo was with a field demo unit, which was shipped to our facility. The unit was simply not working. We were seeing several messages indicating a leak in the oven, oven error messages, and so on. In the span of two days, we saw six extractions.

The second demonstration was at a local university, and the unit was not used frequently.

I feel conflicted about it.,9,41,False,False,False,chemistry,1498228886,True,"I've been a member of LinkedIn for years and have been in the ACS DOC for nearly that whole time. I just received an e-mail that they're tired of the way LinkedIn restricts them from moderating the page so they're closing it and moving onto a forum that requires membership to the DOC.


I'm of two minds about this. I've been very vocal about how gross I think the ACS is with their pay structure to executives and that their membership offers little to no benefit to anybody beyond grad students. So the fact that they're moving away from a free resource to a paid one disgusts me to some extent, even tho dues to the DOC are only $15 compared to the $160 for general membership.


On the other hand, LinkedIn has been fucking up for a LONG time. The site has become less and less functional for users and much more focused on ads and other marketing spam to drum up money for them. I admit that I've stopped visiting a lot of the groups because they're filled with marketing reports or invitations to niche conferences. If the moderator of the group is telling the truth (and it seems like he is from my POV), then LinkedIn deserves to start losing groups for preventing this type of bullshit.


I'll probably pay the $15 and see how I like the forum. Then if I don't I'll bitch a LOT about it. Hopefully it'll get back to the quality it was several years ago tho.

A student I'm tutoring is taking Gen Chem 1 at a local college and his professor has made a few claims that seem pretty ridiculous.
The one that's bothered me continuously is his claim that ANY reaction that is not a redox reaction must be an acid base reaction. The rationale is that one species will act as an electron donor and the other will therefore be the acceptor, meaning they fit the definitions for Lewis acids and bases. While I understand that chemistry can be, to paraphrase my organic chem professor, ""all about electrons moving"", this professor has consequently not taught the class about other important reaction types such as combustion, displacement, elimination, etc. My thought was that he is trying to use the concepts of nucleophile and electrophile to teach how reactions work, but I'd never heard of anyone introducing those concepts before taking organic chem.

Citric acid vs citric acid + ammonium for de-rusting,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1498505980,True,"Hi Chemistry,

I've been researching a lot regarding de-rusting old metal hand tools... A lot of people use citric acid to do this, but this tends to ""etch"" the metal, i.e. it's too strong. It also can be problematic if you leave metal in the acid too much as it can obviously destroy the tools.

Now I read somewhere that someone was saying to mix 50mg of citric acid with 1 liter of water and then add ammonium until a pH of 3.5 is reached. This would -supposedly!- have the effect of canceling the etching, but still leave a strong enough acid for de-rusting. And -again supposedly!- this would not reduce the de-rusting effect.

Now I'm no /r/chemistry buff, so I'd like to get some kind of confirmation that this is not just, non-sensical.

So, does this ""ammonium citrate"" mix make any sense? As far as I understand one can make an acid mix less acid by adding a base, but ammonium plus citric acid does not make water, so ... what would the effect be?!? :-)"

The Curious Behavior of Sodium Selenide in Solution,10,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1498575424,True,"Hello! I'm an intern working at LSUHSC in Shreveport, LA. I'm working on a project that involves the use of selenide donors. Here's my issue: I've been making sodium selenide solutions in preparation for the experiment (which will be done via nitric oxide analysis), but they tend to act quite weirdly in storage. The first thing we tried was freezing them in cryo-vials at -20C but they ended up turning from orange (the original color that the solution has) to purple. Then, whenever they were stored to later be disposed of (sodium selenide is highly reactive and toxic), they turned back to orange. There is clearly some equilibrium that was reached, but the samples are still ruined due to the fact that their concentration of the different chemicals is not known. It should be mentioned that the water used to make the solution was degassed, so that can be ruled out. Next, vacuum tubes were used along with two different storage methods, one in the hypoxic chamber, and one at -4C. This morning, the one in the hypoxic chamber turned clear with a dark gray powder floating at the top, and the other remained orange with a similar amount of gray powder at the top (I don't know if they're the same compound). I looked for information concerning the color that the solutions are supposed to be, but came up with only the result that sodium selenite forms clear solutions, which completely shattered my original hypothesis that the purple that was found was from selenite after the solution had been oxidized! So now I have three samples in three conditions and two unidentified compounds. This is stumping the post docs and grads as well. If any of you guys have worked with selenide before or have any suggestions or hypotheses, I would love to hear your comments! Thanks for reading!"

Lanthanide Oxides vs Aluminum Oxide - which one would be more soluble in polar solvent? Theoretical and experimental discussions are both welcome :-),6,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1498813897,True,"Hello everyone in /r/chemistry,
Lanthanide oxides and aluminum oxide are both highly stable compounds, and are unlikely to dissolve without encouragement by acid or heat in a solvent. 

As a first year PhD student conducting research on Lanthanides materials, I am curious to know more about the extent of Lanthanide oxide stability/solubility/susceptibility to acid etching, specifically in comparison to aluminum oxide. 

I presume this boils down to the strength of the M-O bond, but in this different theories suggest contradictory conclusions:

* If we go by ""hardness"" of the bond, Lanthanides have the advantage over Aluminum because lanthanides have a far larger radii which fits well with the highly electronegative oxygen, forming a very strong ionic bond. On this front Aluminum loses out due to its high charger density and disinclination to donate electrons
* On the other hand, if we consider both as ionic compounds (which they undoubtedly are), the lattice energy considerations would favor Aluminum oxide as being more stable. The reason in this case is also the small ionic radii of aluminum, which figures into a shorter electrostatic distance.

I'm somewhat confused and not sure which would be the case. I'm pretty sure it may well be a combination of both, but ultimately (as in, in experimental context), which one governs?

Any help is greatly appreciated, cheers!"
Advanced Quantum Chemistry Reference Recommendations,3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1498816014,True,"Hi everyone, 

I'm currently in organic synthesis seeking to develop ""physical"" (as in, that of a physicist), rather than ""chemical"", intuition for areas where traditional VSEPR/ MO models cannot fully describe the reactivity of atoms.

Searching for answers here has incidentally compelled me to ask questions such as:

How exactly do orbitals hybridize? E.g., if I put OH- and H+ in a room together, will applying TDSE to both their independent wave functions eventually give me the desired linear combination of wave functions? 

At short distances between two reactive partners, through what quantum mechanism do atoms' electrons influence their reactive partner's electronic structure. That is to say, undergraduate QM does not really discuss how wavefunctions exert EM forces and how EM forces in turn influence other wavefunctions.

Using the search function, I've found several suggestions for quantum chemistry texts that discuss electronic structure, but have yet to find one that satisfactorily addresses these kinds of issues in reactivity. I suspect these questions may dabble into QFT areas, which I'm comfortable with.

Such a text, ideally, would discuss the mathematical nature of anti-bonding orbitals and other phenomena undergrad QM/ QChem courses do not satisfactorily cover.

Any suggestions?

Distillation Procedure Question,10,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1498859614,True,"Next week I'm performing an esterification between benzyl alcohol and 2-bromopropionyl bromide and later bromoisobutyryl bromide in DCM and pyridine.  I was originally thinking that I was going to have to distill the acid bromide prior to use, but my PI convinced me to determine the ratio of acid to acid bromide first via NMR and use excess, which he admitted was ""lazy"" chemistry, but I wouldn't have to worry about other decomposition problems.

However, I do need to distill my DCM prior to use to remove water and I have only ever performed a simple distillation once over a year ago in an intro to organic chem class.  I've looked into fractional distillation and now have a decent understanding of how distillation works.  The procedure for DCM that I've found says to distill from calcium sulfate, calcium hydride, or phosphorous pentoxide.  I've been trying to understand what ""distill from"" means and I'm guessing that I should add one of the drying agents and do a simple distillation. I only guess this because I found that it is okay to add calcium hydride or phosphorous pentoxide and directly to the still because the water is removed irreversibly, unlike hydrates.  I'm also assuming that the procedure mentions the use of calcium sulfate with this method because of DCM's low boiling point relative to water.  

Have I come to the correct conclusion about this procedure?

Also, my current experience level is going into my third undergraduate year as a Biophysics Major with two semesters of organic chem under my belt.  I have been working in an organic chem lab for one semester and I am trying my darndest to do some independent research with at least a paper written in the next two years.

Are there any other edible alkali powders to gel konjac root?,20,11,False,False,False,chemistry,1498860222,True,"Long story short, I'm trying to make konjac root gel, a.k.a. glucomannan gel. I read on here; http://colonygums.com/konjac/ that konjac root forms a gel when heated with a pH of 9-10. 

The link also says that; ""Konjac is composed of a repeating polysaccharide chain, with addition of a mild alkali such as calcium hydroxide; Konjac will set to a strong, elastic gel resisting melting even under extended heat condition.""

My problem comes from the usage of calcium hydroxide since it seems to be quite dangerous with a lot of ill health effects if consumed in excess (or even in very small amounts). I know that the combination of konjac and calcium hydroxide can be used to make shirataki noodles and a variety of imitation seafood products. 

My question is is there any other powdered alkali that can be used to get the gel to a 9-10 pH range other than the potentially dangerous calcium hydroxide? Maybe sodium bicarbonate?"

If you don't know a good way to accelerate natural stalactite formation, is there another substance I could use to make artificial fast stalactites? There's so much potential there in terms of beautiful fountains, stalactites forming on familiar objects, etc.
Thank you!

Advice on a DIBAL reduction,30,28,False,False,False,chemistry,1499029459,True,"I'm attempting to reduce an alkyne to an alkene using DIBAL. The first time I ran this reaction it worked reasonably well (~60% yield) however every subsequent attempt has just spat out starting material.

Safely keeping liquid Mercury for a collection? Is it worth it?,17,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1499038027,True,"Hi everyone! I couldn't think of a better place to ask and I need some advice.

I've since put it in a small Mason jar, completely filled with rice, and put that in a slightly bigger Mason jar filled with rice. I've also labeled the jar. He just had it sitting in the garage with his tools. I'd like to take it because I don't know that he would dispose of it properly.

I'm not sure whether RmV or mV mode was used, but based on my own measurements I think it was RmV mode. My gut is telling me that I shouldn't need to add 220mV to account for the reference because that was the point of calibration.

Carbonation and Bubble Size!,12,22,False,False,False,chemistry,1499122518,True,"Hi all!

I'm working on making a diy carbonation system for my father's birthday, and i had a question about controlling bubble size. If any of you have had both Perrier and Pellegrino water, there is a noticeable difference in bubble size. My father much prefers Pellegrino, as it has finer (smaller) bubbles.

I've been doing lots of research into what controls bubble size in carbonated beverages (so that I can ensure the system creates the smallest bubbles possible), and from what I've found, it appears to be controlled by 3 things:

* amount of CO2 dissolved

* surface of container (nucleation sites)

* chemical composition (smaller bubbles are usually achieved by adding surfactants)

Are there any other ways that you all know of to control bubble size in a liquid that is supersaturated with a gas? There is some obvious difference between Perrier and Pellegrino, but it is not immediately obvious from looking at the ingredients/nutritional content.

So let's suppose I were to grab a 1 L container, fill it with oxygen gas at 50 degrees Celsius and one atmospheric pressure. Then I would lock the container away in fictitious perfect vacuum where there's is no possible way that the oxygen is affected by the outside environment. I leave the container in the vacuum and then I come back 50 years later to check the container.

How to improve efficiency on flash chromatography,23,30,False,False,False,chemistry,1499137997,True,"I am pursuing my Master's degree in North America, and a part of my thesis is basically building a diverse library of bicyclic sulfone compounds for biological testing in-house.

We don't have any automated flash chromatography system, and the prep-HPLCs are either being repaired or have a long waitlist.

Need help/advice for an extraction of organic product from salts (scheme included),5,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1499204127,True,"Hi, there.

[Link to schemes](http://i.imgur.com/D8yWol6.png); my reaction is on top, and the original reaction is on the bottom, adapted from [this](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/JR9590002865) procedure (page 5/7 of the PDF or 2869 of the journal, starting at the 16th line from the top).  My assumption is that the amine displaces the sulphite of the formaldehyde–bisulphite adduct, loses water to make the imine, which is then attacked by bisulphite again, and is finally substituted by the cyanide; this should leave the original amount of NaHSO*_3_* and the excess NaCN as the remaining salts that I need to extract my product from.

In the original procedure on a 130 mmol scale, they reflux a slight excess of NaHSO*_3_* and 37-40% aqueous formaldehyde solution for 30 minutes, then add a 50% aqueous ""alcohol"" solution (I assumed ethanol; is this right?) of their (1 eq.) aminopyridine and reflux for two hours.  They cool the solution, add an aqueous solution of NaCN (2 eq.), and reflux for 20 hours.  They then evaporate the solvent to dryness, extract with 500 mL of chloroform, reduce the volume to 50 mL, and collect the product that has ""separated as brown nodules"" (this was their only visual description of anything), ultimately recrystallising in ethyl acetate, getting an 88% yield.

The only difference that I made was my choice of pyridine (4-aminopyridine instead of 2-amino-4-methylpyridine).  After the addition of NaCN, the refluxing solution gradually yellowed (from colourless), becoming very dark brown (nearly black) by the end of 20 hours.  In removing the solvent under reduced pressure, **the brown mass thickened considerably to the consistency of molasses**.  There was no description of the appearance at this stage in the original procedure, so they may or may not have experienced the same.  I tried one 100 mL chloroform extraction from this sludge and (visually) didn't get very much in my flask at all (far less than 20% of expected yield), so I added another ~150 mL to the sludge, sonicated for about 10 minutes, and then stirred for a day, just to see if I could get much out of it, but (combined with the first extraction) only isolated about 14% of theoretical yield.  I tried removing even more water from the sludge under more heat and vacuum (hoping that I could grind it into a powder to increase the surface area for extraction), but this simply **hardened the tar into a taffy-like consistency**.

I decided to attempt a Soxhlet extraction over the weekend, hoping that the dripping chloroform would slowly erode the tar, exposing more product to dissolve, but at the end of the weekend, very little was extracted.

I've considered using other solvents, but am not sure what I could use.  I was surprised to see that while the product is quite soluble in water, it is not very soluble at all in ethanol.  Due to nucleophilicity of and formation of adducts from the remaining salts, I can't use any solvent containing a carbonyl and probably not a nitrile, either.  I don't see how I can do a liquid/liquid extraction, since the product has such an affinity for water and a very low affinity for the chloroform.  I had considered freezing the tar in liquid nitrogen, grinding it into a powder to increase the surface area, and then trying to extract with chloroform, but I figure that upon warming up, the powder will just melt into a tar again.  The next step in my reaction is to hydrolyse the nitrile into a carboxylic acid; the only other thing I can think of is treating the tar with HCl/H*_2_*O to not just hydrolyse the nitrile, but to also convert the NaHSO*_3_* to SO*_2_* and the NaCN to HCN, both leaving as gases, leaving my hydrolysed product and NaCl behind, but this really *really* doesn't seem like a desirable route.

I'd appreciate any advice that you'd have to offer.

What are some polar solvents which are very insoluble in water?,17,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1499278541,True,"I know that 1,2-dichlorobenzene is one solvent which has a solubility in water of around 156 mg/L, 25°C.

"Water treatment, raising pH & other interactions",7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1499286277,True,"I'm trying to solve some chemistry issues with my well water. This has been an ongoing issue with the company who sold me the equipment so I am trying to get some answers for myself. 

Right now we inject a soda ash (sodium carbonate) solution into the water to raise the pH. Then we inject a chlorine solution to provide oxidization pulling the iron oxide out of the water for filtration by the magnesium dioxide and activated carbon filter tanks. 

The water report shows a lot of iron and low pH (as well as sulfur and a few other minor items). I believe the pH from the well right now is around 6.6 or so. We are looking to get it to around 7.2. 

I have a few questions I am hoping one of you smart people can answer: 

1. Initially we were injecting the chlorine first and then the soda ash. Doing this we did not see an increase in the pH consummate with the amount being injected. As much as we increased the amount of the injection nothing really changed on the pH. I suggested that we swap the injection points since the result wasn't what we expected and that seemed to solve the issue. Is this correct? Would chlorinated water have some reason to prevent the pH from increasing with the soda ash? 

2. The system to inject the soda ash is near the highest settings (it's a chemical feed pump with a stroke and frequency that can both be set). Either I make a more concentrated solution, get a pump with a higher capacity or different chemical. I am mixing 4lbs of soda ash with 5 gallons of water. I am not sure the max solution I can make but I think that was close to it. I was considering going with sodium hydroxide as the next chemical. Can someone tell me the conversion of the soda ash to sodium hydroxide for the same pH solution to inject, so I have a starting point? I don't know how to figure it out except for making a solution of each and testing with my pH meter. I'd like to know ahead of time so I can figure out the cost difference. 

3. Would soda ash cause the water to taste odd? We are dealing with a few issue and one of those is a bad, sort of bitter, aftertaste. We've had many issues so I know what rusty/iron water tastes like, what low pH water tastes like (in our case copper from the pipes and makes your stomach feel bad) but the current issue is not that it is overly bad, just not good. We compare to store filtered water (full up 5 gallon bottles at the store) and the difference is pretty big.

One of these mixes is called Blue Lust. Now I'm not very interested in the effect itself, its supposed to be a libido increasing 'drug'. All our customers who repeatedly come in our shop to buy it report a experience VERY similar to MDMA. It's a very 'heady' experience and apparently also psychedelic. Now, what I don't understand is why it has this effect.

On their website(just google Blue Lust ingredients) I found the ingredients of the mix:
Spring water, L-Arginine 40,5 mg, ascorbic acid 15mg, Caffeine 30mg, Plasma gans, Alcohol 5%, pigment

They sell it in a 10ml bottle of blue liquid.

I've been researching the ingredients and by far the weirdest thing in there is Plasma gans. It seems to be co2 GANS. I can not find a single trustworthy source about this substance. Its apparently created by the Keshe Foundation which just seems to be one big scam.

But apart from this very vague substance I don't understand why all my customers are experiencing all these effects. There's basically a cup of coffee worth of caffeine in it. Some arginine and ascorbic acid. 5% alcohol in 10ml should not have an effect whatsoever. 

So why is this liquid such a powerful drug? 

Do any of the ingredients, mentioned above, have an extra effect when they're combined?

If not, then why is it strong enough to make ex-MDMA users and other hardcore party drug people come back to my store to tell me how strong it is?

ICP Standards and glassware for trace analysis,11,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1499442747,True,"Hi guys, 

Thanks for your help previously with trace analysis! 
It turns out that my QC check solutions often ran into problems because my laboratory tends to keep standards made from certified standards for up to 6 months. When fresh standards are used, my ICP-OES returns exactly 20ppb for every element in the standard. 

However, this lab is one that is ISO17025 accredited and I won't be able to change the SOPs or do things differently from the previous chemist without being questioned during audits
. Anyone else who works in such situations? Does your laboratory keep the standards or do you make fresh batches everyday? The range of my standards are 5-100ppb. Honestly, I used to prepare standards fresh for ICP during undergrad, but with SOPs in place, I'm not really sure which approach is better. 

What's a good concentration of nitric acid to use as a rinse? I was previously told 20% v/v, bur I have concerns this might be a little high. The manual that comes with my machine focuses more on the software for the ICP and doesn't give an answer on this. 

Also, a potentially silly question - I came across many protocols for washing glassware like volumetric flasks but I can't be sure which to use. 20% nitric acid soak overnight before rinsing? Rinsing with tap water and Milli-Q? Or rinsing, 1% nitric acid soak overnight and then finally rinsing with Milli-Q water?

Is it adsorption or a reaction?   Wikipedia says ""ion exchange properties having a strong exchange affinity for ammonium (NH4+)"". How does this work in the context of adsorbing ammonia from air? 

Regarding the aqueous properties, apparently it's recharged with sodium ions (with some help from sodium hydroxide which speeds up the process).  Does ammonia gas (not the charged ion) still have an exchange affinity with the clinoptilolite even in the gas phase?  Where would the sodium go in the gas phase case?  Or is this a function of pore size happening to be right for ammonia (like the way a 3A sieve pulls water).

People talk of ""recharging"" clinoptilolite used for neutralizing ammonia in the gas phase by sitting it out in sunlight.   Does this actually work?  Is it purely acting as an adsorbant using something like van der Waals forces in that case, and ion exchange doesn't come into the picture in the gas phase?

Anyway I hope this makes sense.  It's been hard to nail down specifics on this, a lot of things are only written from one specific use case and not on the theory of how any of this stuff happens."

Sodium sulfide to sulfuric acid?,9,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1499626822,True,"I have about a pound of sodium sulfide flakes and am looking for something to do with them in my home chemistry lab (with limited equipment).  Since sulfuric acid is a very useful reagent, I was wondering if it is practical to synthesize it by heating Na2S in air to produce Na2CO3 and SO2 (gas), then bubbling the SO2 through a 3% H2O2 solution to make dilute H2SO4.

Would this work if I just heat the Na2S flakes in a stoppered flask on a hot plate, pushing air through the vessel with an aquarium bubbler pump, and then bubbling the output through the H2O2 solution?  I wasn't able to find any indication online of the temperature at which the reaction

2 Na2S + 3 O2 + 2 CO2 -> 2 Na2CO3 + 2 SO2

would run at a reasonable rate.

Suggestions for a how to make this reaction work best, or for an alternate interesting synthesis that can be accomplished with Na2S and limited equipment would be welcome.

Glovebox Issue,6,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1499632524,True,"Our mBraun Labmaster is having an issue with water in the atmosphere.

I have tried regenerating the catalyst, but no liquid was produced. I confirmed a good gas flow prior to regen and ~600 PSI of forming gas was used throughout the process. I believe that there is an issue with our regeneration and that it is not properly removing oxygen and moisture from the catalyst (there should've been some volume of liquid as it had been ~6 months since the last regeneration).

After purging for 30 mins, I did chemical tests of the atmosphere. Diethylzinc solution produced no vapors, while TiCl4 solution generated a large amount of vapors. We only have an oxygen analyzer for our glovebox. Therefore, I am pretty certain that we have a significant amount of water in our atmosphere.

I should also note, prior to my reactions becoming no longer reproducible (which sparked my concerns for an issue with the atmosphere), our glovebox freezer had an issue with its refrigerant and had to be turned off, thus warming the glovebox freezer to room temp. I suspect the warming of the glovebox freezer released a significant amount of water into the atmosphere.

Has anyone had issues with their regeneration not producing any liquid, if so, what was the solution? Should I try replacing the catalyst? My fear about doing this is that if my regeneration is not working properly, I won't be able to activate the catalyst and it could make the problem worse. "

Question about chemical activity,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1499805409,True,"I understand the definition of chemical activity but I think I am missing something.  For liquid solutions, activity is defined as the activity coefficient multiplied by the concentration (often in mol/L) divided by the 'standard amount concentration'.  For dilute solutions, the standard amount concentration is 1 M, and so it follows that activity is approximately equal to molar concentration for ideal solutions.  
  
For pure liquids, activity is equal to 1 by definition, which I suppose means that according to the above definition, the 'standard amount concentration' for pure liquids must be equal to the concentration of the pure solvent, so ~55M for water.    
  
So these are two extremes - dilute solution and 100% pure substance.  I am curious about what happens in between - at solute concentrations above say 0.5M up to the pure substance.  
  
I found this [paper](http://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/6685204/2005ChemSocRevBlandamer.pdf) (Figure 9) that looks at the activity of water in water-acetonitrile mixtures, and it appears in this case that water activity increases probably in a linear way at low water concentrations, but reaches a plateau around 0.9 and only very gradually increases up to 1.0.  Does the 'standard amount concentration' change over this range?
  
This leaves me scratching my head about a few things.  First, it seems to suggest that it is impossible for a substance in liquid solution to have a higher activity than 1.  So for something like 2M H2O in CH3CN, which is about 4% water, 96% CH3CN by volume, the activity of water in this case is less than half of the concentration.  For 25M water, the activity of the water is only scarcely higher.  This intuitively seems wrong to me.  It is, however, critically important since essentially all the thermodynamic properties are a function of activity and not concentration.  
  
Am I missing something?  Is activity not a useful concept outside the parameters of dilute solutions and pure liquids?  Is it possible for solutes in liquid solutions to have activities >1?"

So in the Harry Potter Universe there's this ""Floo Powder"" which burns with a brilliant green flame when tossed into a fire. Now the classic way to get a lovely green flame is by making a solution of trimethyl borate by mixing borax and methanol, but it's a liquid solution. While that would be good enough for a flame emission spectra demo, it would really be awesome to do something that would make a bit more of a 'whoosh' like Floo Powder in the movies (here's the move scene--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm6ROBZe-PM).

I was wondering however if there is any other way to dissolve gold without the use of strong acidic conditions? Specifically, some equilibrium process which may be exploited (Ex. Au(III) in some very small concentration that forms the clusters over a long time due to favorable interaction with the hydrogel). 

If anyone knows of any papers on the subject please point me their way. Thanks!"

"Is ""salt air"" and its reputation for being damaging a myth or a fact?",16,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1499867682,True,"I have lived in coastal areas my whole life, and I often hear people claiming that the ""salt in the air"" ruins things like cars and barbecues. I always thought that solutes dissolved in the solvent and when the solvent evaporated, the solute was left behind.
Whenever someone says ""salt air"" I just assume they mean ""humid air"" but recent discussions have left me wondering. Humid air has water in vapor form, and water is a solvent for salt, so does the vapor form of water have salt in it? I assume not, but may be incorrect.

So what is the deal, is ""salt air"" fact or fantasy?"

Nontoxic alloy with melting point between 38-45 °C?,5,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1499984864,True,"I'm wondering if there's any type of eutectic alloy, probably with gallium, that melts at a temperature between 38 °C (100 °F) and 45 °C (113 °F) and is nontoxic (no lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, etc). I want to know this because I want something like that as an alternative to wax for body hair removal.

The potential advantages the alloy might have over normal body wax would be:

* The impurities (hair, blackheads, skin gunk) would be much lighter than the alloy and would float on top, rather than staying within.

* Similarly, bacteria can't grow within it, and its boiling/decomposition point would probably be much higher than wax's.

* Therefore, a lot more of it could be reused than wax can.

* Liquid metal conducts heat much faster than wax, so it would both heat faster and cool faster.

* It wets the skin (this might be a positive or a negative).

* And finally, painting someone's skin with liquid metal would be really cool."

Hi everyone! Welcome back to week 31 of Synthetic Challenge!!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

With the current implementation of the two molecule challenges, the synthetic products will be labelled with A or B and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference if it is a novel technique.

You do not have to solve synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

I genuine don't know how I've made it this far-- and I'm terrified,19,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1500173517,True,"Okay, so I'll preface this by saying that I met with a researcher the other day who is basically giving me a major role in a project involving a *massive* company in the industry and an Ivy League collaborator. It's high stakes, it's long, and he wants me to play a major role and get a major publication. 

I don't know wtf is going on 

First of all, I'm not a good student. I'm a solid B student in pretty much every class, even some of my chemistry courses. I'm garbage at physics (retaking E&M this Fall, at that, but I didn't fail it before). I also don't think I'm generally smart at all. But I've done a lot in chemistry for my age (3rd year university undergrad), which I also think was a fluke. 

And I can prove my incompetence mathematically! GPA aside, or not, I applied for over 30 internships last year and got zero offers. I even got some interviews and wasted my precious time (which could have been used studying, which I need to do a lot of because I'm dumb af), and money, which I also don't have a lot of. But yeah, nothing. Because my GPA is low (above 3.0, but like... barely) and in interviews they probably saw that I'm a dolt anyway. 

But... I accidentally got a job in a lab in high school by being in the right place at the right time, and after high school, got a recommendation from my boss to work for another scientist in industry R&D, did an internship, got an offer back and *rejected* it (for external reasons), but then they recommended me to work with one of the top researchers in my specific field for the year, which I did (but I wasn't given a project or anything, which kind of sucked, but it was good experience anyway), and then the PI there, as well as another person from industry, recommended me to work in a semi-different field on the analytical chemistry end, who recommended me to work with this particular supervisor who wants to give me this massive project. And that's after publishing my work from this summer. 

But again, none of this was organic. If I were to simply email a professor, as I have in the past, they'd either ignore me or tell me that I'm not qualified. When I try for opportunities like normal people, I have around a 10% success rate (since I did get into one lab freshman year, but I didn't love it anyway and only spent the semester. Also, didn't publish or present anything. Bleh). I'm scared that all of these people are recommending me because they're nice and they see things in my *future*, but now I'm actually being given a major project and I don't think I'm smart enough to do it. I'm *terrified*. What if I screw it up and waste millions of dollars? What if I get there my first day and have no idea wtf I'm doing? I know how to *use* a lot of instrumentation, and I can learn pretty quickly, but I hardly know any theory and I guarantee the majority of my peers would do a better job than me. But I've entered this whirlwind of nice people being nice and I've finally been given the pie-in-the-sky project I've always dreamed of, funded, signed, sealed, delivered... and I don't know if I'm good enough for it. I don't know how I even got here. I feel like a child who lost their mom in the supermarket but I'm also on one of those electric carts and I don't know how to turn it off. What do? I'm afraid if I turn down this project, it'll be like, that's it, no more offers for me. 

And also... the project sounds really, really exciting. I'd be working on my favorite instrumentation, in one dank-ass facility, studying a subject that I'm obsessed with. The literature is interesting, the implications are amazing, and the work, if I can do it, sounds fun as hell. But why *me*? I'm not smart enough for this. I'm not even sure I'm smart enough to be in the major half the time. But I like it... and I always have. But some intelligence is just inherent, and I know that I'm lacking in that compared to my peers. So. That's the situation. Any suggestions? Anecdotes? Textual xanax to calm me down?

I have a few tropical plants in a small greenhouse in my bedroom. I've had some trouble with white fuzzy mold, and was given some Kocide Blue Xtra (cupric hydroxide) fungicide by my local gardening center. 

I made a dilute mix as per the instructions on the box and sprayed the plants and substrate. 

This stuff says its for use on vegetable gardens and it says vegetables are safe to eat after 24 hours. However I just want to make sure there's no danger to myself or my dog being in the same room as the greenhouse, from accidental inhalation as the liquid evaporates etc. The greenhouse is closed up but not air tight.

Question regarding the electronic band structure of metals,10,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1500497070,True,"Posted this on /r/chemhelp about a day ago and did not get any responses so far, so I came here to reach more redditors. I hope this is welcome here as it's not a ""homework question"" and I see several other questions on the front page.

> During a recent lecture on solid-solid reactions I learned that reactants in these reactions are usually powdered and then mixed as well as possible to maximise the surface area through which diffusion between particles can occur. When explaining this, the professor made a remark about how any metal, when powdered, appears black. He gave a brief explanation about it that had had to do with the electronic band structure of metals that I didn't quite catch. As we were short on time I never managed to ask him and when trying to look it up did not come across a satisfactory explanation.

>My understanding is this: A material appears black if it is capable of absorbing light of all wavelengths within the visible spectrum. For metals this would mean that the band gap between the valance band and conductive band is so small that even light of relatively low energy (red) can excite an electron from one into the other.
>
Now Copper for instance appears red because its band gap only allows for it to absorb light with a wavelength lesser than that of light somewhere below red light. Copper reflects the light that it can't absorb, hence appearing red in colour. Now, when making a powder from a copper crystal, essentially the metallic Cu-Cu bonds within it are broken down until only smaller and smaller particles of fewer Cu-Atoms remain.
>
And here is where my understanding fails me: Obviously, less and less Atomic Cu orbitals are overlapping the smaller these particles get because they contain fewer atoms. But this, from my understanding, should lead to an increasingly large band gap. This would mean it requires *more* energy to excite any electrons into the conductive band instead of less. And so a greater range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum should be *reflected*, shifting it's colour perhaps to orange. Evidently, this does not happen, so somewhere in my thought process here there must be a flaw that I don't see.

Solvent safety and consequences,17,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1500608033,True,"I was hoping to get some input on the safety of my workplace. We use a lacquer made mainly of ethyl acetate, mek and mibk. I've attached the msds [here](http://imgur.com/woZqDKV). Basically, we run a test on the coating of a plastic film with the lacquer. For the test, we apply a few drops from a bottle dropper of the lacquer to the film and spread it across a paper sized sheet of plastic. Then we put it in an oven (@90^C) for 5 seconds and put a piece of tape on the film to see if the lacquer adheres. 


The amount used is ~0.6 grams and we run the test 3x. Here is a picture of the [lacquer](http://imgur.com/jKEHluI). The lab is about 120m^3 but airflow is poor and there is no good (I know, safety at where I work sucks and I'm lookin for a new employer). I know the solvent has to dissipate after ~3 hours because that's when I can stop smelling it (it's not odor fatigue, sometimes I would leave after a test started and would come back unable to smell it also, the odor is very strong). So at most the concentration in air would be 0.6x3/120=15mg/m^3 for maybe 3 hours. Frequency of the test is about 1.5 times per week. Also, while doing the test I would wear gloves, I can't force them to buy a hood but I did what I could for my safety. 


After being in the lab for 2 months, and I guess having run ~10 tests I was out at a bar over the weekend and got pretty drunk. The next day I woke up really hung over and just figured it was from drinking but I didn't get better the next day. In fact, by Monday I was even worse. My thinking was very sluggish and what I describe as foggy. Short term memory and focus were very poor. It was difficult to carry on a conversation. The symptom onset was very severe. At the end of the week, I lost my balance a few times but eventually my symptoms started to subside very gradually. It has been 6 months since then and I have improved. I don't have balance issues anymore and my short term memory has gotten better and so has my focus. I still don't consider myself back to normal but there have been improvements. My question is, could this be from solvent exposure? For more evidence, I went to the doctor and have had a battery of tests done. MRI showed nothing wrong and there was no obvious kidney or liver damage. I also have been tested for lead and that was negative. 


EDIT: I should also add, that while these VOCs were in the air, besides the odor, there were no irritating symptoms like eyes watering or throats burning or anything like that. Hell, my symptoms didn't even seem to be exacerbated when the test was being performed. They didn't improve over the weekend or when I was at home"

> In the molecule of alcohols, the alkyl groups pushes the electrons and increases the density of electrons of oxygen. Because of this, the bond O-H from alcohols is less polar than the ones in water. That's why alcohols are weaker acids than water.      


What I don't understand is : how come the bond gets less polar if oxygen gets more electrons ? Polarity doesn't mean you have 2 poles? So if one gets more electrons, the polarity should increase (that's how I think). If the polarity should decrease as they say, the protons could go faster....please help me figure out where I am wrong :/

Is sp3 Carbon in a higher energy state?,16,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1500647219,True,"My basic Chemistry knowledge has lead me to a few postulates:

1 - p Orbitals have a Higher Energy than s Orbitals, within the same level

2 - sp3 Orbitals, given that they are composed of three p to one s Orbital, are more similar to p Orbitals

3 - Carbon, in its ground state, has two electrons in s and two in p Orbitals



Therefore, when ""mixing"" Orbitals, two electrons - in 2s - would acquire MORE potential energy - given that sp3 looks more like p Orbitals - than the energy released by the two 2p electrons.
Hence my question:

Is my logic correct? If so, where does this extra energy come from?"

ELINerd the challenges of synthesis of cat attractants e.g. cis-trans-nepetalacetone,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1500651249,True,"So according to [study](https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-017-0987-6), cats respond *really well* to dried silver vine fruit galls.  Fruit galls are caused by a bug which lays eggs in the growing fruit; the larvae cause excessive growth through plant hormone stimulation, and the galls have high concentrations of odd compounds.  Oak galls, for example, provide enough tannins to make iron-gall ink.

In the study, they provide chemical analysis of the plants.  Catnip contains 1,010mcg of cis-trans-nepetalacetone per 1g dried material, and not much of anything else.  Silver vine contains:

* 290mcg/g actinidine
* 167mcg/g iridomyrmecin
* 164mcg/g Isodihydronepetalactone
* 315mcg/g, 141mcg/g, and 181mcg/g of three Isodihydronepetalactone isomers

Apparently you can [make racemic nepetalacetone in one step](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b11796?journalCode=jacsat).

I wonder if there's a similar cheap method to make the above compounds.  I assume the four stereoisomers of Isodihydronepetalacetone (and dihydronepetalacetone itself) would all have slighlty-different physical properties; these are VOCs and vaporize readily, so thermal distillation (under partial vacuum?) should allow for separation based on boiling points.

To be crude about it:  you can just run a series of (n) thumpers after a redox stil and get n-1 purified compounds for a mixture of >n volatile compounds.  This will get you compounds in order of descending boiling point:  a thumper condenses the output of a stil into a sealed container at the bottom, with an exit at the top to go to the next output; the condensate has the temperature of the hottest chemical constituent, and so tends to maintain temperature just below the boiling point of that constituent.  Distill fermented sugars this way and you get a constant stream of 100C liquid water and 78C ethanol pouring into it, so you keep <100C water and the ethanol immediately boils out.

That's great and all, but I have no idea how viable it is to essentially generate synthetic cat attractants.  Nobody seems to do it.  Commercial racemic nepetalacetone is available as an insect repellent, so it's got to be cheaper than steam distillation of catnip leaves, right?"
Hey r/chem back with another question,9,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1500652643,True,"I have been having troubles focusing this week so help me out with something I have been stuck on mentally.


At work I was curious as to what my 31% HCl was in molarity. It then struck me that I either forgot or never learned how to do the conversion as mathematically I got around 8 molar by doing .31 multiplied by 1000, then dividing by the molar mass of HCl which is around 36.


However upon googling it It appears I undershot due to the density being different. My question is, does there exist a way to calculate molarity from concentration without finding the density experimentally? As you cant always google it.


Second, Upon googling it appeared some people were neglecting to factor density into finding the molarity of 50% NaOH. 

After doing some thinking about it, it does make sense to factor in density as even if I do add say 40g of NaOH to one liter of water, it may change the volume resulting in error. So I ask should one always consider density of the final solution or only in more concentrated cases.



Bonus question, a coworker insists that in industry if one states 100% HCl or the like it really means 38%, or whatever the respective max is. For example, he stated that if one says they have 25% NaOH they mean one fourth of 50%, which is the solubility max. This seems extremely confusing and I cant help but feel hes mistaken.


Once again thanks for the help and if one has a cure for a flustered mind let me know



Edit: Typo


Edit 2: What I believe I failed to understand is in lab it was understood that this 31% HCl was W/V not W/W as the sources using density may have implied. In that case one could simply do .31*1000/36.46. 


Density only matters when a solution is w/w correct?"

Different coupling constants for quartet in NMR,1,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1500885343,True,"Im measuring some 13C NMR spectra of chiral compound (2 centres - chriral axis and quarternary carbon) and this compound also has CF3 group.

I wonder if the one that is slightly different is due to experimental error (mostly the NMR software peak picking ) or if its due to the fact that my compound is chiral and one of the fluorines is more shielded/deshielded than the other ones?

Anyone feel like helping me figure out what's going on in these NMR spectra?,48,26,False,False,False,chemistry,1501189403,True,"The other day I posted a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/6pmw7i/is_it_possible_to_separate_keto_enol_tautomers/) about separating keto enol tautomers on a silica column. Got some good advice, but still confused. 

I started with an alpha fluoro beta hydroxy ester and oxidized it with DMP. 

Here is the 1HNMR spectrum: http://imgur.com/a/5QqdM

And here is the 19F spectrum: http://imgur.com/a/MbnkT

Molecular structures are shown in the pictures. 

I need to run another column. I think the solvent mixture I was using for the fist column had shit in it because the same impurity signals show up in both spectra. 

The first spectrum in the proton link (suspected enol) is confusing. It is almost exactly similar to the keto spectrum minus the broad doublet from the alpha hydrogen. Someone in the other thread mentioned it could be an elimination product, but if that were the case, I would see the beta hydrogen somewhere, which I don't. I also can't find an -OH proton signal. I know they're hit or miss, but I thought with enols they appear more often. 

The 19F spectra are pretty straight forward. The suspected enol has a singlet at -120 ppm which is consistent with F atoms on sp2 carbons. Also, if this was an elimination product, that F signal should be a doublet due to coupling with a beta hydrogen. The keto spectrum has a doublet at -192ppm which is also consistent with shift tables. 

My plan now is to run another column on the suspected enol and  hope I have enough material for a carbon NMR. Mass spec was pretty useless. Fragmented too hard and got basically no molecular ion.

But in the meantime, anyone have any ideas? Does it look to you like I separated the keto and enol tautomers? I didn't think this was possible.

Thanks for reading.

Reducing LC-MS/MS carryover,10,8,False,False,False,chemistry,1501242440,True,"My lab has been screening for fentanyl and other analogues on LC-MS/MS and we also quantify Fentanyl and Norfentanyl specifically. We have an administrative LOD of 0.2 ng/mL. Lately we've been seeing carryover of fentanyl, specifically, below the LOD in case specimens, but we know it's definitely present. 

Has anyone experienced carryover like this? I'm thinking we might just end up injecting blanks after every case specimen, but I'm not sure if there's something with regards to the needle wash that can be changed. Right now our mobile phase A - Water with 0.01% formic acid and B - Methanol with 0.01% formic acid. We use a combination of three solvents for our needle wash (90:10 water:methanol, 90:10 methanol:water, and just Methanol) and that's reduced carryover a little bit, but not fully. 

Any help is appreciated. 

EDIT: Turns out 1:1:1 Water:MeCN:2-PrOH helped eliminate our carryover issues. And increasing the needle wash time. Thanks all!"

I am under the impression that NMR is pretty much the most resilient, so long as you don't mess with the x,y shims or, heaven forbid, drop a tube in the instrument. HPLC is also pretty resilient, though I don't know and haven't used much of it. A MassSpec is somewhat finicky, but as long as your in the ballpark with conc., and no solids, there shouldn't be much of an issue (speaking from ESI experience). 

Since the analytical guy at our university is pretty hard to talk to, I figure I would see if the chemists of reddit would enlighten me.

I'm a robotics teacher in Brazil and my students are making a 3D printed robot for a competition.

I am very fascinated by science and already have a small robotics lab and some astronomy equipment. I think chemistry is the next step for me.

I don't plant on making extremely toxic chemicals,explosives, or drugs. Just things like other amateur chemistry channels on YouTube such as NileRed,Nurdrage,and ThoSoi2,Dougs lab, the backyard scientist, chemplayer, etc.

I am concerned about the legality of it though. I've looked online through amateur chemistry forums(one with over 154,000 members/amateur chemists) and they always mention OSHA,Nfpa, and zoning laws as well as to not have any suspicious chemicals.

From research it looks like OSHA only applies if you have employes, Nfpa 45 only applies if you have more than 4liters of flammable liquid(I won't ). From another Reddit post someone said zoning laws regulate the size of the lab. My lab won't be very big. Just an extra table and some storage shelves added to my robotics lab. I will also only have very small amounts of chemicals(10-500grams). I have found many chemicals online from amazon,elemental scientific,and home science tools. I will also dispose of chemicals properly by neutralizing them to a safe level or taking them to the local dump's chemical disposal day. I will store chemicals by hazard groups and label everything. I will keep them in locked cabinets.

On the other forum I mentioned many members have had talks with the police. Most of the police mentioned are pretty nice about it but some have said after they couldn't find anything illegal they instead charged them for zoning laws.

I wish to practice this hobby safely and legally. Where can I find a list of the chemical zoning laws and what other laws are there?

Working with the instrument doesn't necessarily require principle knowledge, but I am curious if anyone has some useful things to read in addition to an introductory booklet on the concepts and technique. 

It turns out that my interpretation of the information I was given seems to be faulty. So, the sample is ionized by plasma and emits UV/Vis radiation that is detected and converted to useable analysis results because each element has its very own specific wavelengths at which they absorb or that they emit. Using Planck's equation and Beer Lambert Absorbancy law, we can get both qualitative and quantitative info about the sample. AmIright?

Calibration curve for unknown Compound using Brix refractometer,1,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1501607934,True,"Hi guys,

At work I've got a solution which constituents concentrations are hidden behind the brand name, lets say: COMPOUND.

My collegue took 1ml,2ml,3ml,4ml and so on and filled all the flasks up to 100ml and assumed that 1ml in 100ml is 1%, 2ml is 2% and so on.
Then she took the Brix scale results for each and she calculated a factor by which we now multiply our refractometric results.

My question is, how can the factor be trustworthy, if we do not know what is inside the COMPOUND and how much of it is inside. What if it was for example 10% sugar to begin with? Shouldn't we be sure that we actually added for example 1g of pure X to 99 g of water to write that it is in fact 1%?

I hope you can clear this one out for me.

I did a calibration curve (regression >0.999) with 0.1, 0.5 and 1ppm along with 10 blanks and 3 readings of 20ppb standards.

I'm crunching the data and use the LOD[ppb] =(3*SD)/slope calculation. Now here is where I kind of am unsure whether my data is right. I use the RSD of the intensities. 

My predecessor on the other hand who previously did a LOD on a similar method used the RSD of the concentration readings of the blank along with the concentration of the blank sample. LOD[ppb] =3*RSD/(average concentration in ppb/100)

Could you guys help with this? What is the right way to go about doing this? Thank you! "

I'm not a scientist. The most fun part of chemistry for me was setting fire to magnesium and playing with Bunsen burners back in high school - alas I need its help !

I am trying to create an exfoliation solution but I am unsure on how to dilute the ingredients in order to get the correct (safe) strength. 

I have 100% salicylic acid powder and 100% pure isopropanol. You are able to dissolve the acid into the alcohol - though this is where I am getting stuck.

One part of each would surely give a 50% strength of the acid solution, however, does this go using volume or weight. 

Given how one is a powder, and the other liquid, I am stumped as to the accurate of diluting the acid properly, and certainly don't want to dissolve my feet because I have got this wrong...

Chem Grad App: Explain Head Injury Without Sounding Unprofessional?,7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1501707984,True,"I am entering the grad school application cycle this fall (my senior year of undergrad) and have an unusual question about framing my application. Last summer I sustained a severe head injury that influenced every aspect of my life my junior year. I was struggling very hard mentally, was seeing a doctor 2-3 times a week and was hospitalized 3 times. As a result, I had a semester of extremely poor academic performance where of my 5 classes I withdrew from one and left the others with an A, B+, C-, and D+.  I rebounded fairly well but imperfectly in the spring for an A- average. It’s taken me a year to fully recover but I am fine now.
    
My question is: How can I explain my injury without sounding like a “poor me” case or an excuse maker? 

For what it’s worth, the rest of my picture is as follows:

Chemistry & Math double Major with Biology minor from a small liberal arts school with a rigorous, all science course load

3.54 GPA (what I’m most worried about)

No GRE scores yet

5 semesters and 1 summer of research in the same lab (Natural Products)

REU at U Mich Ann Arbor (Natural Products)

TA’d 3 classes and been a department tutor for 4 semesters, probably will do more this year

3 Scholarships (from within the school) and 3 Awards (also from within the school)

3 presentations, 1 paper hopefully submitted for review this fall

3 LOR from professors who know me extremely well

I am extraordinarily demoralized because I am proud of what I have accomplished and feel extroverted enough to sell myself at any interview and in my SOP. I know my grades will be back to straight A’s my senior year now that I have seen a quality neurologist and am much better, but schools will not see those grades! My biggest hope is to return to U Mich, but I worry even that is a long shot at this point due to my GPA…. I am willing to accept that I am no longer a strong candidate for top-tier universities, but hope I can lessen the blow on my application somehow.

**TL;DR: How can I explain poor academic performance due to a head injury without sounding like a “poor me” case or an excuse maker?**

Conflicting publications regarding SN2 reactions involving aminopyridines,9,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1501733404,True,"Hi, there.

I'm trying to make *N*-(4-pyridyl)glycine, and have tried three routes so far, all of which are failing:

* Formalin and sodium bisulphite form adduct, followed by addition of 4-aminopyridine, then sodium cyanide, isolate, then hydrolyse.  This is the common way of making N-phenylglycine for the industrial synthesis of indigo.
* S*_N_*2 reaction of 4-aminopyridine and ethyl bromoacetate (followed by hydrolysis) or bromoacetic acid.
* Condensation of 4-aminopyridine and glyoxylic acid, then reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride.

**The most annoying part**, though, is the conflicting information that I'm finding in the literature regarding S*_N_*2 reactions of aminopyridines (e.g., the second reaction mentioned above).

Some publications mention that various species alkylate at the pyridine nitrogen and *not* the amine, while some publications make no mention of this and state that they got amine alkylation in high yield.  When I try reproducing the reactions, it appears that I get the betaine (pyridine nitrogen substituted product) and not the amine substituted product like they reported.

Claims pyridine alkylation: [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cber.19660990712), [2](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules21030332), [3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm030917j)

Claims for amine alkylation: [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-012-2289-6), [2](http://www.ijrce.org/abstract.php?article_id=734).  If you want to see an absolutely shameful excuse for science communication, I'd suggest checking out that last one; there's no excuse for the shittiness of that mechanism, there is no such thing as ""H*_2_*O-d*_6_*"", the product isn't soluble in water like they claim, the product is not blue like they claim, and the NMR doesn't quite make sense.

There are other examples of each around, but I chose these ones.

Either way, when I try reactions on aminopyridines that supposedly give amine alkylation, I don't get the same product as they claim (NMR doesn't match) and it looks like pyridine alkylation.  I can't find them at the moment, but there are even general discussions that exist vaguely saying that aminopyridines don't do S*_N_*2 reactions with their amino group.

It also seems like a fair number of the publications that I read have mistakes in them (e.g., integration not matching, molar quantity not matching weight reported, quantities used not matching described ratios of reactants, etc.).  **Thus, I'm wondering if the claims of amine alkylation of aminopyridines are just wrong, or if there actually is a way to have the amine do an S*_N_*2 of an alkyl halide.**

Help with a mercury-zinc amalgam (for mercury spill),3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1501783943,True,"I want to clean up a mercury spill (millions of micro beads spread around my apartment, approximately half the contents of a thermometer, maybe less) by using zinc to form an amalgam. I'm not a chemist.

I am aware that zinc dust is flammable, especially when heated or in contact with water.

However, it seems that mercury spill kits (which don't exist in my country) include some form of acid to help the reaction. This is a guide from the University of Reading: 

> 1: Some commercial kits used powdered zinc with the addition of approximately 5% w/v citric acid, to speed up the amalgamation of the mercury, and it is recommended that this practice be followed..
> 2: Powdered zinc should be handled very carefully, as it represents a fire hazard, and should not be used in the presence of naked flames, or in combination with elemental sulphur, as this can create an explosion risk.

So, the addition of 5% w/v citric acid clearly does not create a smoke/fire hazard?

Could I drop the use of citric acid, and spread only zinc dust on my floor? How about adding some citric acid but no water? Which are the safest conditions to help the amalgam form?  I'm hoping to remove a good amount of mercury this way, and let the remaining just evaporate and leave the house through ventilation. Thank you."

I'm attempting to teach pH calculations and I just feel like I'm drowning a little. My mentor isn't much help, the only feedback I'm getting is 'use the board more'. I feel like I'm doing a disservice to these students :/ 

Any tips/tricks or help would be very appreciated! As I haven't studied to be a chemistry teacher I don't have a bank of resources to help me out.

This whole situation has made me realise how much I bloody hated chemistry in high school! Already sick of the ""talk talk talk now do questions"" model of teaching, it's boring for me so I can't imagine how boring it is for the kids. 

Please help a struggling student teacher out! I don't want my poor teaching to put these students off chemistry - I absolutely loved studying chemistry at uni. "

So currently I have worked with a professor in his research lab for the spring semester and this summer.

I've anticipated joining his team for so long and he has definitely seemed to enjoy our conversations. My current professor wants me to stay on his team so I can publish something and make my application for PhD programs more appealing. He also told me he was going through the tenure process and it would really help him out if he got a publication out there. He also offered me a grant to stay in his lab for the fall semester. But I really don't enjoy this research as much as I enjoy learning about the other professor's research. What should I do? I almost feel like I am obligated to stay with my current professor but I've already committed to joining the other team. My current professor told me that I can simply join the other lab in the spring and stay for the summer. I really wanted to get as much time as possible in that lab though. I'm so confused. Some assistance would greatly be appreciated. I haven't spoken with the other professor because he has not been in town.

Although I, when I was a freshmen, tasted a little bit of distilled water and it tasted like plastic (because it was in a plastic wash bottle).

But I always hear people saying that drinking distilled water will make you sick. Because it has so little ions in it, it could make your cells be filled with excess fluid and you'll have diarrhea or something like that.

I heard about this over and over again. On high school, on undergraduate school, on graduate school...

What's a (somewhat safe) esterification process?,16,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1502047567,True,"Hey.

So I always loved chemistry and always tried to learn more about it. But turns out the studies I'll pursue (computer science) do not involve a single chemistry lesson. My only way to continue learning is by myself as I won't have much time once I go back to studying...

But it's okay. I took advantage of massive discounts and bought enough lab equipment to play around for a while. I just lack a few glassware (mainly a distillation apparatus and that kind of pear shaped vial used to separate phases (sorry I don't know what you call it in English...)

My father will help me with the safety equipment and protocols (he's literally working in that field) so I've got that covered, but I'm still not feeling like I have enough experience to manipulate dangerous chemicals in high concentrations (just take it as I'm avoiding chlorine / nitrogen reactions and carcinogens like benzene)

I'm lacking some glassware, yes, but by avoiding high (>50C) temperatures and taking care of it my borosilicate erlenmeyer can probably be used for heating some species. I'll be able to afford more equipment with time, but this'll have to do for now.

I wanna start slowly, I wanted to do some saponification and esterifications as they're quite ""rewarding"" (being able to say ""I made soap"" or ""I made perfume"" is better than just saying ""hey so I got bored and titrated some hydrochloric acid yesterday""!) 

With that in mind, I'd like to know what esterification processes you'd recommend. I already made benzyl acetate a few months ago (well... It was at school, and in France cyclohexane and other useful compounds can't be sold for private uses)

While I try to determine what the cause is, I'm looking at a short term solution.

Is it possible to, as the title asks, take a full chromatograph and subtract it from another? I'm considering saving a blank run to capture the natural rise in the baseline, and then writing a function to subtract that file from whatever complex sample I've run, so I can receive an easier-to-read write up of contents.

BSB is overkill. Using a single point to represent the rising amount of 'contaminants' wipes out most of my smaller peaks.

Not a chemist here. I'm looking into anti-reflective coatings, specifically MgF2 (but also CaF2) deposited by spin coating sol-gels as its something I can do as a hobby and not spend 20k+ on a thermal sputtering machine.

The only thing thats holding me back is that is the chemical synthesis of the sol gels involves either hydrofluoric acid (super scary) and Trifluoroacetic acid (only slightly less scary).

The current ""best"" recipe (is recipe the right word? what word do you chemists use) I have found is:

0.57 g (0.005 mol) of Mg(OC2Hs)2 (Wako) was dissolved in 15 ml of isopropanol (i-C3HvOH) (Taisei). After adding 1 ml (0.0132 mol) of TFA (CF3COOH) (Wako), the solution was stirred for 4 h at room temperature.

I need some help here.,12,8,False,False,False,chemistry,1502293502,True," My sister gets concerned that I drink bottled water because ""it is way too acidic"".

I know her worries are possibly over the top, but I have little knowledge in chemistry at this level and am therefore unable to make an informed rebuttal. 

Questions:

1. If his tests were accurate (I believe he was using phenol red) what could be reasons for bottled water to possibly have a pH less than 6? CO2?

For the HF, one of the groups just mixes HF in glass beakers to dilute it. When I pointed out that this is not good, one of the workers got very defensive and basically told me to walk away if I'm nervous but that they've been doing that is for thirty years and it's fine. Note that there's no fume hoods either and the acids are concentrated. For the HCl, they just pour it down the sink because 'it's the same thing as stomach acid'. 

I've already talked with other chemists and they think these are pretty serious violations-- what do the older, seasoned chemists think? As in people who've been working with strong acids for over 30 years ... is there something I just don't get? I thought HF was very dangerous and that HCl can fuck up the plumbing...

I can't figure out what is causing my GC baseline upward drift with temperature ramp.,11,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1502360397,True,"TL;DR: new gc-fid setup with new column. Upward baseline drift with temperature ramp. No detectable leaks. I can't figure it out. 

Preface: I'm not an expert chromatographer, but I'm not a novice either. 

Setup: Agilent 7890B GC, MMI inlet, with FID detection 
Gas: UHP He with in-line O2, moisture and carbon filters. 
Column: DB-5MS UI 30 m x 0.25 mm x 1.00 um

The system is brand new, as is the column I am working on validating it. Agilent sends out a HP-5 column with detector performance mix. The system works. 

Now I installed a new Db-5 column and perform condition per Agilent parameters. I set up a new method witch had a temperature ramp to 300C, below the column limits if 325C (350C over temp limit) and inject my sample. First run is exactly as expected. I shut down for the nigh. Next morning I am checking for reproducibility and standardization. Now I am getting a steep upward drift at about 220C. Baseline at 40C-160c is less than 10 pA. From 160-220c it goes up to about 20 pA which is normal. From there it was rising quickly to 170-220 pA. 

What I've done so far: replaced septums and I let liner. Agilent set up with a splitless liner, I forgot to put a universal split/splitless liner after. The old line was defiantly fouled. I trimmed the column, replaced the ferrels and am using self locking nuts at both ends. Cleans the detector jets and baked the column and detector again. Ran a few solvent washes and checked for leaks. No leaks. Baseline is better, but still gets up to 120 pA at the upper temp limits, where 25-30 pA is normal. 

Anyone have any ideas? I made sure to purge the column before hearing, so I don't see how I could have any oxidative degradation of the stationary phase. It's a new column with maybe 20 sample injections (2 good). I cannot find any source of leaks in the system or bleed at the fittings. Is it possible I just have a faulty column?

The basicity of o-nitroaniline vs p-nitroaniline?,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1502448981,True,"I am learning about the basicity and acidity of the organic molecules and I come across the next interesting thing...the pka of o-nitroaniline is -0.28 and the pka of p-nitroaniline is 1.01(data from Pubchem)...and I really don't understand why.

I would say that o-nitroaniline is more basic...here is my reasoning, please correct me:

- p-nitroaniline: the -NH2's +E effect and the -NO2's -E effect overlap => because of the strong conjugation, the electronic density at the nitrogen atom decreases => the basicity of -NH2 group decreases 

- o-nitroaniline: -NO2 group is voluminous => a deviation from coplanarity of the -NH2 group occurs(intramolecular steric interaction) => the conjugation between -NH2 group and the aromatic nucleus doesn't take place => the electronic density at the nitrogen atom is higher than in the other case => o-nitroaniline is a stronger base. Here I also take in consideration the next factors that would decrease the basicity:

1. the -I effect of the -NO2 group, but the inductive effect is much weaker than the electromeric effect in the previous case 
2. the hydrogen bond between -NH2 and -NO2...I really can't see it having such a big influence 
3. the -NH2 group being ""squished"" by the -NO2 group in a manner that the proton(H+) can't came close enough to the nitrogen atom...I thought that is the most important factor of the decrease basicity of the o-nitroaniline, but I read that this ""squishing"" doesn't occur for o-nitrobenzoic acid, so why would it happen here? (I couldn't find any source for this phenomenon in English unfortunately, but I will continue to search)

Btw, sorry for bad English...I am not used with the English chemistry terminology. 

EDIT: About the source from the point 3, the book I was talking about is Organic Chemistry Vol.2 by C.D.Nenitescu(romanian author) and the book says that the thing about o-nitrobenzoic acid was studied by  Ingold...maybe this is helpful in finding the original source"

Ethanol from acetic acid.,12,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1502742257,True,"Hey.

So I'm out of ethanol. And I need some as I'd like to work out a few esterifications (mainly, ethyl acetate through a Fisher esterification).

I'd like to make it myself. Now I know I could just rush for a brewery and do it the old fashioned way, but it's just boring. I'd like to produce a reasonable amount (50 mL) of ethanol from acetic acid. The reverse is possible, so how hard can it be? I've done some research on the topic, and it seems that it is possible to do so by hydrogenating the acetic acid.

Now, it raises another problem: I need dihydrogen. It just so happens that I have leftover aluminium sheets and some hydrochloric acid. If I'm not mistaken, the aluminium will form a salt with the chlorine leaving me with some dihydrogen that I can try to store. Which solves my hydrogen problem.

Now, I'm pretty sure what I'm doing isn't safe. The Al+HCl reaction is highly exothermic and can result in an explosion. Then, heating the acetic acid with hydrogen seems too easy. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to do it differently (find another hydrogen source). Overhault I'm NOT confident at all and wanted some advice before putting anyone in danger (I'm not living alone...).

"There's no way we're converting cyclohexane to benzene IN our GC, right?",22,48,False,False,False,chemistry,1502819893,True,"Trying to keep this brief, but I can provide more details as necessary.  

We have an air-quality monitoring GC down right near the Gulf Coast. Has a stainless steel thermal desorption trap, Helium carrier gas, FID/PID detection. When we introduce cyclohexane headspace, we are seeing instead 2/3 benzene and 1/3 cyclohexane. Inexplicable.

The stainless steel trap is nearly 15 years old, and therefore been subjected to a lot of heating/cooling (up to ~300 C). The prevailing theory here is that Nickel or Iron has leeched out of the steel and onto the activated carbon, providing a catalyst for this reaction. We're talking about ~1ppmv cyclohexane at the most... is a 66% conversion rate remotely possible?    

[Here's](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2009131769A1?cl=en) a patent that speaks a bit about the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction (cyclohexane -> benzene + 3 H2)

> Reaction (3) is of course the inverse of reaction (2). Thus, whereas reaction (2) is favored by conditions of relatively low temperature and high pressure, to drive reaction (3) in the forward direction, thermodynamics demands lower pressure and/or higher temperatures. Thus the cyclohexane dehydrogenation step is typically run under conditions comprising **a temperature greater than 300° C**, such as between about 330° C and about 430° C, and a **pressure less than 1000 kPa, such as between about 100 and about 500 kPa**. [0045] The cyclohexane dehydrogenation is generally conducted in the presence of a catalyst having an active metal function, such as one or more Group VIII metals on a porous non-acidic support. Suitable **Group VIII metals include palladium, platinum, nickel, rhodium, ruthenium** and combinations thereof. Conveniently, the dehydrogenation metal is combined with one or more other elements, such as potassium, sodium, tin and/or phosphorus, for acid site neutralization and for improving catalyst stability and selectivity. Suitable supports for the dehydrogenation catalyst include aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, **activated carbon** and combinations thereof. The support typically has a surface area of more than 3 m2/g, such as about 20 to about 500 m2/g. The cyclohexane conversion is typically greater than 50%, such as from about 70 to about 99%. [0046] A gas co-feed to the dehydrogenation reactor is not required, but a hydrogen gas co-feed is preferred to suppress catalyst coking, typically so that the H2/hydrocarbon molar feed ratio is between about 0.5: 1 and about 5: 1. In fact, in one embodiment, the fresh makeup hydrogen for the overall process is supplied to the cyclohexane dehydrogenation step.  

The only real test we've tried is lowering the trap temp down to ~200 C, which DID result in no benzene being 'produced' from a cyclohexane headspace sample. Possible?

EDIT: Also, if we replace the trap with a new one, the issue is no longer seen. So I feel safe in saying we've isolated the issue to the trap."

There are a lot of chemicals added to this reaction and I don't quite get their role. But what is the driving force for this reaction?
* In hydroboration-oxidation what is the driving force for this reaction? 
* In Julia-Kocienski olefination the last step is an elimination, where the driving force is the loss of SO2, why is this a driving force? And also is this an E2 elimination? And why is 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazole-5-oxide a good leaving group, it said so in a book by Clayden?
* In the Mitsonubo Reaction then the formation of the strong O=P bond is the driving force right?
* S-atom oxidation to form sulfone, can someone explain the mechanism for me?
* Asymmetric allylation under Keck's conditions what drives the reaction?
* Phthalimide vs. Boc protection group, they say that Phthalamide makes it impossible to separate cis and trans by chromatography, whereas it works with Boc, can anyone explain to me why this is?
* Driving force for Pictet-Spengler cyclization?
* Swern oxidation: is the driving force entropy or at least I guess it is when CO and CO2 is eliminated, but is there other driving forces?
* In the first reaction L-glutamic acid gamma-methyl ester is coupled with 2-[3,5-bis(benzyloxy)phenyl]ethylamide our reagents are 1) iBuOCOCl, NMM, CHCl2, I assume that our hydroxyl reacts with CHCl2, but why does it react with our carboxylic acid and not the ester?

Creatine phosphate orally.,0,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1502882620,True,"Creatine phosphate di sodium salt is a cardiac drug used in Chinese hospitals, and some other countries hospitals. It is used IV when someone is having heart surgery, and during their recovery. There is tons of studies on it on NCBI

Elite athletes also inject or IV it 

http://www.espnfc.com.au/story/332061/veron-says-neoton-use-is-common

The question arises what about creatine phosphate orally then? To save the hassle of having to inject it.

There is a claim in this patent that di sodium creatine phosphate tetrahydate breaks down into creatine+ phosphate ( i think it is a mis type in the intro where it says "" Disodium Creatine Tetraphosphate"" rather than tetra hydrate or he mistyped when he said tetra hydrate later). 

http://patents.com/us-8372821.html

The mechanism for the conversion of disodium creatine phosphate tetrahydrate to creatine monohydrate has not been elucidated but it is believed to be due to the hydrolysis of ester linkage of disodium creatine phosphate tetrahydrate to yield free creatine and inorganic phosphate. The mechanism of hydrolysis may be affected by the ionization of the phosphate group (pKa1=2 and pKa2=6.2). 


The mechanism for the conversion of DCPT to CM has not been elucidated but it is believed to be due to the hydrolysis of ester linkage of DCTP to yield free Creatine and inorganic phosphate. Preparation: Disodium Creatine Phosphate Tetrahydrate Aqueous Solution Concentration: 0.250 mg/mL pH: 3.0 Condition: 40.degree. C. 

Di sodium creatine phosphate has no ester bonds though...

And then chemist Patrick Arnold whom is respected in the body building world for inventing numerous artificial steroids says

https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=359546

anyway, creatine phosphate is the form in the muscle which can regenerate ATP (i.e. create energy). creatine exists in the cell in an equilibrium between free creatine and creatine phosphate

Unfortunately, creatine phosphate cannot be taken orally. It is quickly hydrolyzed in the stomach to creatine and phosphoric acid.

Even if it could be taken orally it can't enter the muscle cells efficiently anyway. If you injected creatine phosphate you would not get a very significant uptake into the muscle cells. YOu may get some indirect ergogenic effects however through effects on cell membranes and stuff. I studied this somewhat. Its complicated

P.S. Creatine phosphate chemically speaking is creatine covalently linked to phosphoric acid through one of creatine's guanidino nitrogens. This is a high energy bond. Creatine phosphate is not simply a salt between creatine and phosphoric acid (like what you have with creatine malate, creatine citrate etc). Creatine phosphate is relatively expensive to manufacture compared to creatine monohydrate 

There is a reason creatine phosphate is injected in hospitals, and not monohydrate, and it must be because the phosphate bonded to it allows it better access to the cells or else it would be cheaper to just inject monohydrate. So Patrick Arnold must be wrong about it not entering cells efficiently. 

And he talks more on it here

http://anabolicminds.com/forum/advanced-discussion-patrick/226423-30-grams-creatine.html

referencing this study showing phosphocreatININE can convert back to phosphocreatine

http://www.jbc.org/content/260/12/7562.long

so even if some phosphocreatine did convert to phosphocreaTININE in the stomach (if that is its only breakd down product), it can convert back to phosphocreatine. 

This study here shows it is pretty darn stable at acid, and alkaline pH

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4986110/

The author of the above study says 

6% H2O2 was performed in the oxidation study and 1N HCl was carried out in the acid hydrolysis. However, HCl had a negative peak which may interfere with the determination of creatinine phosphate disodium salt and similar problems still existed in the usage of H2O2. For the above reasons, H3PO4 and KMnO4 were chosen as replacements. All the results of the forced degradation studies were presented in Table 4. Representative chromatograms obtained under all stress conditions were shown in Figure 8.

He used 0.01 N phosphoric acid for the acid hydrolysis which I'm not sure if is the same pH of the stomach which is 1-2.  Only 1.26% broke down after 40 mins, and in sodium hydroxide 1n after 6 hours only 3.31% broke down.

This means creatine phosphate is actually very stable despite what Patrick Arnold, and that above patent says, and can be taken orally, and presumably absorbed from the guts, and taken up by cells through both creatine, and phosphate transporters which is good not just for athletes but also for the x linked creatine transporter deficiency. 

In all the literature there is only one study on the oral pharmacokinetics of CP, and sci hub does not have the full article ):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8839790#

There is only one supplement company in the world that has it ready to go in a bottle though, and that is biotech, and the noobs put niacin in it, which is well known in the literature to inhibit phosphate (and so creatine phosphate) absorption by 50%. 0_0

Someone needs to to further studies on it to find out how much breaks down in HCL pH 1-2 solution, and the pharmacokinetics of oral dosing. Until then I recommend body builders switch to creatine phosphate from monohydrate, and give it a go. I bought 5kg from Ali Baba/China for 400 AUD inc delivery, and it will arrive soon. 

Some places to get it are- 

Biotechs formulation on ebay or some shops.

Ali Baba/China manufacturers. 

Someone on ebay USA is selling a 5kg lot of it atm but only ships to USA. 

and here http://allcosmeticsource.com/disodium-creatine-phosphate-9851kgbag-p-646.html

di sodium is in it because it takes 2 sodium ions to transport one creatine or one phosphate (or one creatine phosphate) across their corresponding transporters (or one transporter for CP). 

If someone takes it, and it works well, they could start selling it in 1kg lots on their countries local ebay, make some $$$, and allow others to buy it easy."

Reaction of sodium hydroxide and Aluminum,11,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1502900910,True,"I was curious as to how this reaction proceeds, upon googling the equation it is found that NaOH and Al react to form sodium aluminate and Hydrogen gas, however Aluminum forms an oxide pretty fast upon being exposed to air. That being said, upon looking at the reaction between aluminum oxide and sodium hydroxide it appears water is formed in place of hydrogen gas.


Now I dont have a strong inorganic chemistry background yet, so I may already have led myself astray, but is it safe to say the reaction between sodium hydroxide and aluminum foil or piping is actually two part? First the oxide layer is reacted with the sodium hydroxide, producing water, and once this layer is gone elemental aluminum can start to react forming hydrogen gas?


Once again, a question formed from random curiousity, but I cant seem to understand why most sources seem to neglect the oxide layer of aluminum in this reaction, especially since it forms so fast.

Discovery of Photo-Development Anecdote?,3,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1502909418,True,"Hello, 

I need some help determining the veracity  and background of an anecdote I heard. I've developed analog photography as a hobby, and I remember being in Gen Chem in uni when the professor told a story about the discovery of silver halide oxidation which lead to the creation of photographic development. 

From what I remember, two scientists were working in their lab and had spread emulsions of silver and some other chemicals on glass plates. One of the researchers recalls that since he had very little money, he was forced to smoke cheap cigars, and when he exhaled smoke onto one of the plates, he noticed the silver oxidize, producing a dark pattern. 

He supposedly deduced that the sulfur in his cheap tobacco had acted as an oxidizing agent, and from this idea, the first chemical photo development was made. 

I remember one of the slides containing a sourced quote from the researcher in question, but I've no idea the names nor where they were when this happened--though I'd guess it was in Germany. 

If anyone can shed some light on this, I would be infinitely appreciative! "

Can you help me out? I’m looking for ideas on internal standards to use for quantitative phytocannabinoid analysis via split/splitless GC with FID detection.,14,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1503006249,True,"First off, I'm in the USA and working for startup with a state issued medical cannabis license. I’m looking for ideas on internal standards to use for phytocannabinoid analysis via split/splitless GC with FID detection. The method is a high throughput method so I want something cheap and plentiful.

I’m using [this](http://www.restek.com/catalog/view/8496) column to separate the phytocannabinoids. It has good resolution for most samples and the run is complete in under 10 minutes. I'm also considering using an HP-5 or some other stationary phase for confirmation since my GC has dual/split splitless and dual FID. 

I am looking for two internal standards, one that is lighter than all or most phytocannabinoids so it elutes before them, and one that is heavier so it elutes after. Sigma Aldrich sells internal standards but they are expensive for the kind for the kind of sample throughput I’m using this method for. I want to spend pennies per day on internal standards rather than $30-$100+.

Does anyone have any ideas? I was thinking of buying unscheduled, unregulated synthetic research chemicals (drugs), but I’m not sure if i can get them in in a high enough grade. I have accounts with VWR and Sigma Aldrich, and can probably make accounts with other suppliers if necessary.

Thanks in advance for your insightful comments.

What is the symmetry of the final state when an IR transition in the x-direction is allowed?""

Ok, so, my logic is as follows: Transition is allowed if the integral &lt;Psi final | transition dipole moment operator | Psi initial&gt; is non zero.

The integral is non zero if the product of the wavefunctions and operators irreducible representations contains the totally symmetric irreducible representation.

So the integral can be represented as, getting specific to the question now,

(Psi final) * (B1) * (A2) = A1 (Psi final) * (B2) = A1

So I would expect that Psi final would be B2, excep that the answer key says that the answer is B1.

Anyways, I'd like to be able to 100% remove the chemical after as well - needless to say, since this is something my family and I smoke I don't want to throw something like Drano down the tube without consulting some advice first. 

Normally I'd just trash it but since this was a $150 waterpipe that a friend made into a custom hookah for me I cannot let one damn fly be the end of it so I *really* appreciate any advice beforehand."

Glove Box Tips?,35,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1503191856,True,"So we just received a used glove box from another lab, a Labconco 50800-00. It seems to be in really good condition. I have never used a glove box, but since I am the only grad student in my lab I am in charge of setting it up and taking care of it. 
We set it on a table of convenient height, attached an argon cylinder, and I have begun wiping down and cleaning it. However, I am having an trouble opening the outer transfer chamber door. The latch moves as the inner door does, but for some reason it will not lift up to open. Does it maybe need to be turned on for this outer door to open? Any advice? Also this came from a lab doing inorganic synthesis and we will be using it for organic synthesis.


TLDR; Any other tips and/or tricks for setting-up and using a glove box would be appreciated. Again I am absolutely new to glove boxes so anything would be helpful. Thank you in advance!"
Scientist salary negotiation question,37,32,False,False,False,chemistry,1503203800,True,"Hi friends, PhD chemist here a few years out of grad school in my first industry job (US if it matters). I currently work at a large, publicly traded biopharma company and earn a good salary (a bit over 100k), stock, etc as part of my compensation package. But the job sucks and I'm thinking of jumping ship to a startup or earlier stage company. I haven't found a job yet, but I'm hoping to join a company working on something cool and on the order of 10-50 employees in one of the major US biotech regions.

One thing that's holding me back is my concern about a pay cut. I'm likely not senior enough to land anything higher than another scientist position wherever I go, so should I expect to take a pay cut if I want to work for a startup? Also, how does stock work in these situations (I'm aware it may be worthless if the company goes bust)? Suppose I'm a scientist and the 10th employee at a startup, is there any sort of guideline on how much of the company I might own? 1%? 0.1%? 0.01%? I have no idea how to ballpark what is reasonable. I'm curious how to negotiate on these things because it seems obvious that the smaller company would not have the resources to match the larger company's, so I feel like I can't plausibly ask them to match my current salary.

Salary aside, I'm curious what other people's experiences have been like with this sort of transition. I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks!"

Sodium acetate production,10,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1503259914,True,"Hey.

So out of boredom I went on a quest to produce anhydrous sodium acetate.

First step was reacting the acetic acid with the sodium hydroxide. What shocked me was *how exothermic* the reaction was. I have no words. I had to cover the flask with ice packs.

First mistake: I don't have the glassware required to titrate solutions so I'll never know the concentration of my sodium hydroxide. So I had to add the sodium hydroxide to the acetic acid with a syringe until the pH had reached 6-7 (tested with pH paper, so not accurate at all...). Anyway, the reactives are still wrapped up in ice. I have an exactly 250mL solution.

Now I'm curious about the next steps. Can I just boil off the solution? I'm afraid my acetic acid isn't pure (it's sold as cleaning vinegar with 14% acetic acid). By now there's probably a lot of byproducts in the flask. I don't want to boil off any dangerous stuff."
Methanol detection in Gas Chromatography..,33,13,False,False,False,chemistry,1503261115,True,"I don't have much experience with analytical chemistry and having hard time detecting methanol in GC.

Ideally, each lab member could submit their availability to use each instrument, and a fair schedule would be generated from these responses... If a student wants to forfeit a day on an instrument they could put that day up for others to see and take if they want more instrument time. Also ideal if free :) $$$

The group does use google apps and can all see the calendar online for each instrument as well, so I've considered google forms for submitting availability, but that would still require one of us to assemble the responses into a schedule, and it would be a time saver to skip that...

Vinyl dihalide Suzuki coupling problem (following published method),9,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1503449955,True,"I've been attempting a Suzuki coupling reaction for the past 4 weeks and have struggled to get even a mediocre yield. I am following a published procedure from 10.1039/C5TC00354G, a screenshot of the procedure is [here](http://imgur.com/a/0IOD9).


I am using boronic acid to yield tetraphenylethylene (TPE) rather than 2-boric acid-9,9-dioctylfluorene to yield (E)-1,2-diphenylethene-1,2-bis(9,9-dioctyl-9Hfluoren-2-yl) as in the published procedure.


Following the published procedure, I get no formation of TPE as demonstrated by TLC, even after adding more catalyst and boronic acid with reflux for 5 days. I degas and backfill my reaction vessel x3 with Argon, and sparge my solvents with Argon for 30 minutes immediately prior to use.


After 10+ failed attempts using different solvents, 1,4-dioxane/H2O, THF/H2O, toluene/H2O/ethanol, and trying K2CO3 and NaCO3 in place of KOH, I decided to try a Palladium(II) catalyst in place of Pd(PPh3)4.


After using Pd(PhCN)2Cl2, I was happy to see formation of TPE as shown by TLC, however yield was only around 15%. I have also tried Pd(OAc)2 with evident formation of my desired compound also.


A general procedure for my reaction is as follows:


To a 2 neck flask was added 1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethylene (50 mg, 0.15 mmol), phenylboronic acid (80 mg, 0.65 mmol), NaHCO3 (60 mg, 0.71 mmol). The flask was degassed and backfilled with Argon three times. To the flask was added 5 mL of MeOH which had been sparged with Argon for 30 minutes immediately prior to use. The reaction mixture was stirred with heating at 65 °C for 20 minutes before adding Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 (8 mg, 0.02 mmol). The reaction mixture was left to reflux for 3 days avoiding light.


A typical TLC for my Suzuki reaction will look like [this](http://imgur.com/a/W3xcW).


There is a lot of starting material remaining and only a very faint spot for my crude product. Additionally, there is one additional spot which is not phenylboronic acid as it does not move from the baseline.


I found that when I combine NaHCO3, phenylboronic acid, and Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 **without** the dibromo compound, TLC gives a single spot with the same Rf value as this extra spot. It is important to note that the catalyst goes from yellow to black immediately upon addition to the solution containing NaHCO3 and PBA.


My questions are as follows:

Weird NMR integration issue.,23,14,False,False,False,chemistry,1503770914,True,"Hi,

So I did a TMS deprotection of an alkyne using Kcarb in MeOH. Worked up by rotavapping the methanol, diluting with ether, and washing with water and drying over MgSO4 followed by a column. The proton NMR shows all the expected signals, and my C13 NMR is showing the correct number of carbons.  

I also did an HSQC to make sure that the new proton signal was correlating to my terminal alkyne carbon, which it was, although weakly. Additionally, the carbon that is attached to the terminal proton after the TMS deprotection did not show up at all in my APT, but it showed up in a normal carbon.  

When integrating the proton NMR, the terminal alkyne proton is only integrating to 0.5 relative to my other known peaks. This is bizarre to me, and my aromatic region is integrating one less than it should as well. Is this common for terminal alkyne protons, or is something else going on?

I should also mention that in my APT, I saw the correct number of quaternary carbons for my molecule, and the correct number of C-H carbons for the aromatic region. So I'm confused as to why my proton NMR is integrating like this."

Help with nitration of 4-substituted pyridines (using TFAA and nitric acid),8,12,False,False,False,chemistry,1503890526,True,"([link to paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/B413285H))

Hi, there.  This reaction is driving me crazy and I would ***really*** appreciate some help before I go completely crazy.

The product that I'm wanting to make is [3-nitropyridine-4-carboxaldehyde](http://www.lookchem.com/3-Nitropyridine-4-carboxaldehyde/).  Of the various pyridines nitrated in this paper, 4-acetylpyridine was one of them, which I hoped (in terms of functionality and electronics) would be close enough to 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde.

The procedure is pretty simple:

* 10 mL of trifluoroacetic anhydride is chilled (ice bath);

* to the TFAA, 17 mmol of the substituted pyridine is slowly added and stirred for two hours while chilled;

* 1.9 mL of concentrated nitric acid is added dropwise and stirred for 9-10 hours;

* the above is then dripped slowly into a chilled solution of 3.2 g of sodium metabisulphite dissolved in 25 mL of water and stirred for 24 hours;

* solution is brought to pH of 6-7 by addition of 25% aqueous sodium hydroxide, then extracted with DCM.

The first time, I attempted nitrating 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde using this procedure.  When trying to extract with DCM, I ended up getting only about 45 mg of residue.  The NMR was a mess, but I didn't see any peaks for my desired product at all.

I know that our substituted pyridine and TFAA are fine, but I was using the last bit of a large jug of nitric acid which I thought may have been garbage, so I got a new bottle of nitric acid and tried again, this time also on my Schlenk line.  Same results again.  I was wondering if the generated bisulphite might have [formed an adduct](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/112704?lang=en&amp;region=CA) with the aldehyde in my analogue, but for some reason not with the ketone like in the original paper.

**Different approach:**

Since that didn't seem to be working, I thought I'd try nitrating 4-methylpyridine (as they did in the paper in 86% yield), which I could then convert into my desired product using [DMFDMA](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sial/40271?lang=en&amp;region=CA) and sodium periodate (literature: 70%).  Trying this approach, the NMR does indicate that I did actually get some 4-methyl-3-nitropyridine... in far less than 1% conversion; recovered mostly unreacted 4-methylpyridine.

I simply don't understand what I'm doing wrong.  It's an RSC paper with Katritzky's name on it, so I don't think it's a total lie.  I do find two things concerning with the paper, though:

* Despite being published in 2005, there are very few publications that cite the work.  Figured that there would be more.  Some mention how it didn't work well for their fairly unrelated pyridine, a few (two, I think) cite the paper simply saying ""synthesised as published"" with no further details, one cites it saying that they also got 83% yield of the 4-acetyl-3-nitropyridine (technically makes sense, but still somewhat surprising that it's the exact same yield), and some cite it without mentioning any nitration reactions at all.

* They state ""We optimized the relative amounts of the reactants required for the nitration of pyridine (pyridine : concentrated nitric acid : TFAA 1 : 2.5 : 6.0) and the conditions (reaction time after addition of nitric acid 12 h at 0–24 °C and then after the addition to sodium metabisulfite solution 12 h at 24 °C). This standard protocol was then used for the nitration of all the pyridine derivatives described in Table 1. **In the case of pyridine nitration, divergence from the standard protocol described above in some cases led to greatly diminished yields of 3-nitropyridine**.  But then in the procedure, they say that 17 mmol of the pyridine, 36 mmol of nitric acid, and 42 mmol of TFAA were used, which works out to a molar ratio of 1:2.12:2.47, which is significantly off of their ""optimized"" procedure.  Even stranger, they state that they used ""10 ml, 42 mmol"" of TFAA, but with a density of 1.511 g/mL and molecular weight of 210.03 g/mol, this works out to be 71.94 mmol, which makes the molar ratio of pyridine to TFAA as 1:4.23 which is *still* quite far off from their ""optimized"" procedure.  Further, they state that they used ""1.9 ml, 36 mmol"" of ""concentrated nitric acid"", but since *concentrated* nitric acid refers to 68-70% aqueous HNO*_3_* (source [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid#Physical_and_chemical_properties), [2](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/stockroom-reagents/learning-center/technical-library/reagent-concentrations.html)) and a molarity of about 15.9 M, 1.9 mL would be about 30 mmol, which is *still* only a molar ratio of pyridine to HNO*_3_* of 1:1.78.  If you instead used pure 100% nitric acid, then *yes*, it *would* be a ratio of about 1:2.52, but then they shouldn't have used the term ""concentrated"", *and* [another Katritzky paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07370650701204702) that cites this procedure and follows it quite closely up until the sodium metabisulphite part *specifically states* that they used 70% nitric acid, resulting in their molar ratio of reagents as 1:3.50:4.68 and ultimately getting a yield of 30%, so I don't think that the use of concentrated nitric acid over 100% nitric acid would explain the ~0% conversion.  Also, the times in their ""optimized"" procedure don't match the times in their ""method A"" procedure.

So with that second point, aside from finding it disturbing that there is such inconsistency with the calculations, I don't understand how the earlier-mentioned citing papers can pretty much say ""check out that paper if you want to see how we did it"" without indicating whether they used the volumes written or the ""optimized"" procedure's ratios.  And I certainly don't understand how [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040402008000975?via%3Dihub#sec2.4) can possibly get an identical 83% despite this inconsistency, especially if ""divergence from the standard protocol described above in some cases led to greatly diminished yields of 3-nitropyridine"".

Things like this just give me no faith or trust in any published paper.

Is there anybody out there who can give me some advice on how to actually synthesise my desired product?  I'm feeling desperate here.

Thanks so much for reading!"

The molar concentration of helium at the centre of the sun is about 26 kM (I think...).,10,130,False,False,False,chemistry,1503911823,True,"I have a fair amount of wait time before working up my currently-running reaction, there's no more room for any more reactions, and I need a break from trying to figure out why [my nitration isn't working](https://redd.it/6wgto7), so...

* A University of Utah course [website](http://web.utah.edu/astro/sun.html) states that the sun's inner core has a density of 162.2 g·cm^(-3)

* A Stanford University course website states that the core is 65% helium by mass (can't find it right now)

* [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-weights-and-isotopic-compositions-relative-atomic-masses) states that the standard atomic weight for helium is 4.002602 g·mol^(-1)

(162.2 g·cm^(-3))·(1000 cm^(3)/L) = 162200 g·L^(-1) of solar core

(162200 g·L^(-1))·0.65 = 105430 g of helium per litre of solar core

(105430 g)·(4.002602 g·mol^(-1))^(-1) = 26430.3655922 mol of helium per litre of solar core

The solar core's helium molar concentration is about 26 kM.

I don't think that there's anything particularly wrong with that calculation, unless some wild physics phenomena exist that require additional consideration (honestly, at these temperatures and pressures, I'd be surprised if there weren't).

To compare:

* 95 mg of caffeine in an eight-ounce cup of coffee is 0.002 M (2 mM).

* since water at 25 °C has a density of [0.9970479 g·cm^(-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_%28data_page%29#Liquid_physical_properties), and the molar mass of water is 18.01535 g·mol^(-1), the molar concentration of water in water at 25 °C is ~55.34435 M (I want to leave a few decimal places but don't quite know where to round it because I don't know the uncertainty in the temperature reading for these values).

* in British Columbia, [all sorts of bad-yet-appropriate things](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/driving-and-cycling/road-safety-rules-and-consequences/drug-alcohol#roadsidescreening) will happen if I drive with a blood alcohol molar concentration not less than (0.0005 cm^(3) ethanol / 1 cm^(3) of blood)·(0.789 g·cm^(-3))·(46.06845 g·mol^(-1))^(-1)·(1000 cm^(3)·L^(-1)) = 0.0085633443278426 mol·L^(-1), or (lower bound just to be safe) about 8.5 mM.

* if my BAC were the same molar concentration as the solar core's helium molar concentration, it would be unsafe for me to drive, as I would likely be undergoing nuclear fusion and/or violently exploding."
Catalysts for different cross-coupling reactions,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1503917098,True,"So I was wondering what the reason for the use of different palladium catalsysts in various cross coupling reactions is.

Why not just use the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst instead? I can't seem to come up with a reason, other that it might be due to different solubilities of the complexes in varying solvents?

I have my own lab and I am not sure what the hell to do with myself.,15,12,False,False,False,chemistry,1504052628,True,"I recently graduated with a degree in chemistry and soil science and have been working in a lab for over 6 years. I was lucky enough to inherit instruments and I basically have a full blown lab including a HS-GC/FID, HPLC UV/Vis and a RID, FTIR with a reflective scope, couple ovens, hood, centrifuges and other random stuff. I also do contract work with a company that provides microarray services and this basically sustains me financially. 

I am at a lost of what to do with my lab and how I go about providing services. I love analytical work and I want to continue on in this field but it seems difficult to promote myself with so many other labs out there. I am obviously a small lab and want to provide services that go beyond routine analyses. I think the other problem is that it is so damn lonely in the lab since it is just me and sometimes my wife and dog and it gets hard to motivate. I would love another chemist to join in and partner with me but need to make more connections I guess. 

I am located in San Luis Obispo, CA and we have a large wine, beer and cannabis industry here and I am thinking of possibly getting involved in those industries. Anyways, if anyone wants to provide their input I would love to hear it or if anyone just so happens wants to start a partnership in a lab let me know.

Did you experience any kind of hazing at the start of grad school?,32,9,False,False,False,chemistry,1504057674,True,"I did today. For the last 3 weeks I've been working on making 10 g of an Iridium photocatalyst to ship out. It was requested to be at least 95% purity. Between learning to balance that, TAing organic chem, office hours, and my own classes, it's been a rough start. Today I finally finished the photocatalyst and between all the other stuff, prepped an NMR sample with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene to be used to check purity (which we actually ran after already shipping it btw).

After getting back from office hours and class, I could see my lab mate wasn't too happy. He had the proton spectrum open and was telling me, ""Man, this is not looking good. Dr. (Adviser) was looking for you and wanted to ask how things looked."" About that time our PI came out of his office and asked how it went. My lab mate mumbled that it didn't look any better than 90%. I started panicking and slowly told him what I'd just heard. After a minute of telling me it was unacceptable and that maybe he shouldn't have written a previous letter of rec for me, both of them started laughing.

My lab mate had chosen a really old/crude NMR of his, and then proceeded to open my actual spectrum. It was apparently ~99.27% pure, which we do without ever running any column.

Did you ever have any ""fun"" like that as a 1st year grad student?"
Auto-replace to speed up writing chemicals in PowerPoint using AutoHotkey,4,9,False,False,False,chemistry,1504066725,True,"To speed up writing chemical stuff in Word I use Word's autocorrect function to do auto-replace. For example, I have set h2o to be auto-replaced by H*_2_*O. That saves tons of time. Unfortunately, you can't do that in PowerPoint since the autocorrect function in PowerPoint doesn't allow text formatting. There are many programs out there that can potentially allow you to do it in PowerPoint but I haven't found a good reliable one that is free.

Below is the  AutoHotkey code that I use to perform correctly formatted auto-replacements (to automatically capitalize, subscript and superscript) in PowerPoint. Maybe some here might find it useful. Let me know if you have questions!

(For example, in the first auto-replacement, writing ch4 in PowerPoint then hitting space bar replaces it to CH*_4_*. In the second example, writing h3 then hitting space bar leads to H*_3_*O^+ Cl^- .)
(Note: You need to have AutoHotkey installed on your computer, which only works on PCs.)

Help in converting Unflavoured whey in end product,7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1504104829,True,"Good evening 

I had started a supplement company where in I used to get the powder manufactured from a guy and then used to reseal it and sell it under my small brand. 

It was going good. 

The manufacturing guy got greedy and started to reduce the aroma taste of all the products (whey and gainers)  little by little. 

I spoke to him but he is adamant that the quality is the same while I know that he has completely diluted the product with inferior raw materials. 

Fortunately I can procure all the rawayerials required for whey and gainer manufacturing over here legally. 

What I don't know is how does one go about the process required to convert whey from its bland taste to something edible. 
I mean the ingredients ratios etc. 

I want to give quality to my customers and I can't continue with this guy any longer.  I have tried a few other manufacturers but they want stupid high quantity which I can't fulfilled.

The mid masses on my ICP-MS are consistently coming up low,8,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1504135122,True,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone might know why the mid masses such as Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se and a couple others are consistently coming up low on my ICP-MS instrument? We are trying to run a linear range test where we run the highest and lowest standard as well as several in between to show that the values are fairly accurate over the entire curve. Just for reference we run our lowest level standard at about 1 ppb and highest level standard at about 100 ppb. We are trying to show that a 25, 50, 100, 150, 250 and 500 ppb solution will be accurate using these standards. When we ran the same test about a year ago the results were pretty good and all within 10-15 percent . Now we're finding that for the 500 ppb solution almost all of the mid masses I listed are running around 380-420 ppb. At first we thought it might be the solutions but we've tested it using ICP-OES and the solution appears to be fairly close to 500 ppb. Additionally we tried changing the cones, cleaning the cones, cleaning the valves, changing tubing, changing the vacuum pump oil, cleaning the torch nebulizer and spray chamber. We suspected it might be saturation so we tried to decrease the sensitivity by decreasing the flow rate of carrier gas as well as playing around with other settings with no luck. Can anyone think of any specific reason why the mid masses would be having issues or other aspects I could try and troubleshoot? Any advice would be appreciated as we've been trying for over a week with no luck. "

I could use some help identifying a chemical reaction that my family saw so that I can explain how it works to them,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1504208259,True,"I'm a first time poster, please be kind.  I am in the pursuit of knowledge and just want to educate my family.

My family witnessed someone ""empty water from a sealed water bottle into a bowl and the liquid turned cloudy and smelled like roses.""  What type of chemical reaction could fit this description and how do you think the magician's ""trick"" would have been done?

Here are the series of events, as they've been described to me since I was not present:
-magician hands out sealed Dasani or other major brand water bottle to an audience member
-Audience member inspects and states the seal of the bottle is in tact.
-Magician tells audience member to open water bottle and have a sip. Audience member confirms that it tastes like water.
-Audience member pours remainder of liquid from inside the water bottle into a bowl where it turns cloudy and smells like roses.

The water bottle and bowl that are used were provided by the magician so, in my opinion, it's definitely possible he did something to either before the show.  I know there are multiple methods to put clear liquid into the water bottle without the seal appearing broken so let's say it would be possible for there to be another liquid already mixed in with the water and the unknown liquid would have to be clear, tasteless, and safe-to-drink.  Also the bowl could have been a certain material or been coated with a substance.  The liquid did not change color until it was in the bowl so could that mean the chemical reaction needed to be exposed to air to undergo the reaction.  Or could the person have backwashed some saliva into the water bottle when taking a sip?

Basically, I have a bunch of different ideas as to how this could've gone down but specifically what I'm looking for is the names of the chemical(s) that would turn cloudy and release the aromatic smell of roses.  I'd appreciate any help.  Perhaps Phenethyl alcohol?"

The problem I have, though, is that I don't even know where to begin or how to structure my learning. I have the feeling that a college class would move to fast and assume too much about what I already know.  Every resource I try to look into assumes a certain amount of knowledge of the field. Again, I know nothing. I get discouraged when I feel like I have to research everything I am taught, and then research the things I research. 

So, if you knew nothing, and I mean nothing, about chemistry, where would you turn to get the proper sequence of education? I'm looking foe something to take me from a middle school level to where I actually feel like I can appreciate the complexity of the subject."

Please help - Resume style and content for 3rd year chemistry student seeking internship?,3,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1504400003,True,"Hi all, thank you for reading my post. 

I am a third year chemistry student at Boston University and am planning to apply for internships for this coming summer. 

I wish to work in the cosmetic chemistry field, in product development and formulation. So, I have been looking at companies like Chanel, L'Oreal, J&amp;J, P&amp;G, Givaudan, and so on for internships. 

I know a resume will be required, and mine has not been updated (my mistake) since I was an anthropology major 3 years ago. I transferred into BU  officially this past Spring and will graduate with ACS certification in 2019. 

My last held position was working two years as a spa concierge for a world wide luxury hotel group, after leaving my precious college, and before that, Dunkin Donuts. I have not yet done research but taken my biology and chemistry up to organic II courses. I am also an independent perfumer and in the process of starting my own company. I have a 3.5 GPA (major and general) and am a member of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars and student member of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, through which I've published a written article. 

My question to all who are kind enough to offer advice, is what should my resume look like and include that would give me the best chance at making it through the door for a cosmetic chemistry related internship? I would appreciate any advice anyone would have to kindly offer. 

Thank you so very much! I want to be of service in helping people feel as beautiful as possible, and help make products more environmentally friendly and also beneficial rather than detrimental to health. This is my greatest imperative and I hope to do this for the rest of my life. "

I think I know the basics of what is happening, the guy spearates the whey, breaks down the lactose in it, into smaller sugars with the lactase enzyme, and the result  can be fermented by the yeast (used for beers) giving us alcohols and co2 in the process.

I'm really interested in what else is being made in there and how those are made. I'd guess methanol and other alcohols are being made (and if so, how would you guys go about measuring how much is being made). I'm not a chemist (not even close) so I'm only familiar with the homemade - ferment fruits and distill alcohol - way of dealing with methanol, that is the ""throw away the first x ml of the y l of the distillate, and it should be safe to drink"".

I also read somewhere that lactose can be broken down by bacteria  - I'm guessing the byproducts differ by the bacteria (and also the yeast) used - but what byproducts could those make in general?

Hello everyone and welcome back to Week 36 of Synthetic Challenge!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

With the current implementation of the two molecule challenges, the synthetic products will be labelled with A or B and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference if it is a novel technique. You do not have to solve synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

Can someone help me understand something specific when using curved arrows from a lone pair to form a pi bond in resonance structures?,5,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1504503015,True,"Hello. This isn't any specific homework problem but rather general clarification I need for understanding the concept completely.

I'm learning about resonance structures and specifically about the curved arrows. However, there was something that didn't make sense to me in the depictions.

I don't understand how, when you draw a curved arrow from a lone pair to form a pi bond, both electrons are coming from one atom to form it.

I thought to form a bond like that both atoms being bonded must use an electron in the formation of the bond, thus each atom is sharing and receiving one electron for a total of two in its orbital.

For example, in [this image](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/49985/ambidentnucleophile1.png?revision=1) the structure on the right to turn into the structure on the left would have to use two of its electrons to form the pi bond while the carbon wouldn't have to use any.

The reverse is also true. I don't understand how a pi bond between two different atoms can result in both electrons in that bond going to just 1 atom rather than splitting equally between the two.

Maybe I'm overthinking this but I don't understand how one atom can use two electrons while the other uses none. I thought they were always 1 and 1."
The effect of temperature on Nylon synthesis?,5,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1504504136,True,"The synthesis of nylon 6,10 occurs when sebacoyl chloride dissolved In hexane is poured carefully over diaminohexane dissolved in water.

Usually nylon synthesis is done at at room temperature. The question is would there be any change in the structure and properties of the nylon if the temperature of the environment in which the reaction takes place was higher? Would a change in temperature during synthesis cause the nylon bonds to weaken or even strengthen? This is because I am doing an experiment to test this relationship but some prior knowledge, hopefully from you would be helpful as there is no information on this available anywhere."

"If you were to design the introductory chemistry course for college, what would you teach?",48,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1504665465,True,"I'm going through syllabi and books for a project and it's strange to see that many courses ~~go directly into~~ start immediately at orbitals, electron counting, and the theoretical side of chemistry. 

Drawing arrows in a box isn't chemistry. Being able to write [Ne] 3s2 3p2 won't help the freshman student who has no basis to understand [Ne] 3s2 3p2. At best it's meaningless, at worst it's confusing. There's plenty of strangeness in chemistry that they are told not to think about (because it's confusing) and to just memorize the answer.

That's not how you form a good basis of understanding. So I'm thinking about how to make that first course better. How would you design a college introductory course? (Not the 101 course, probably the rigorous 121 for STEM students)

I think I would follow the lead of [this really dope series](http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/great-thinkers-great-theorems.html) on the great math thinkers and their great theorems, and talk about the great chemists. The course would be designed to place the students in the shoes of the early chemists who had no conception of modern theory. What were their struggles? What did they seek to understand? What did they learn rightly, learn wrongly, and learn incompletely? I think following those questions would allow students to gain a better intuition for chemistry. Once you've revealed the role of the chemist, *then* you can go teach the theoretical side.

edit: fixed wording. I'm not arguing against teaching theory. Theory is important.

Here's a reply to a deleted comment: I agree that understanding 'why different things come together in a stable way' is important. I would argue that before you do that, you have to understand what these 'different things' are. For example, if you were to teach evolution to students who don't understand what 'animals' are, you would create confusion. Talking about genetics would heighten that confusion. I'm trying to prevent that sort of confusion instead of trudging through it."

Finding an appropriate (-)-sparteine replacement,10,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1504714959,True,"Hey chemmit!

This fall I'm starting my undergraduate senior project, and as in the planning process I've come upon a problem. There is a step in my synthesis that where I need to asymmetrically deprotonate a prochiral alkylphosphine. The literature calls for using *sec*-BuLi and (-)-sparteine to impart stereocontrol. Unfortunately, there seems to be an ongoing shortage of (-)-sparteine, since around 2010 [as reported by C&amp;EN](http://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i17/sparteine-gone.html). 


There are examples in the literature of sparteine replacements for ring-opening polymerization, but I can't find anything about replacements for asymmetric deprotonation. There is one source, [TCI Chemicals](http://www.tcichemicals.com/eshop/en/us/commodity/S0461/), but it's $100/g and it looks like the sparteine is used on a stoichiometric scale. Even if I can retrieve some of the sparteine in purification, I'm still going to be losing some, hurting my ability to reproduce the synthesis at larger scales.

Essentially, I'm wondering if anybody has encountered this problem and found a good solution. If not that, I was wondering if one of you fine people could point me in the right direction.

Chemistry vs pharmacy vs biochemistry,6,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1504727327,True,"Hello all! 

The ""Weekly Careers/Education Questions Thread"" seems to have disappeared so I'm sorry if this post is not allowed here...

I'm kind of stuck deciding my education. I am currently second year pharmacy undergrad student but I'm getting second thoughts about this. I'm sure that I won't be working retail and I chose pharmacy because of possibility for research career.
I'm mostly into chemistry and I thought about changing to chemistry. I chose pharmacy at the first place because I thought it would be good way to get into med chem as we don't have separate degree for that.

Still I'm not sure if that is good option because I have read so many topics that there is no ""good"" work for (med) chemists anymore. Then I thought about biochemistry as well. Do you have any thoughts about biomedicine research etc? Is that better (for future maybe?) than just plain (organic) chemistry?
I know pharmacy might be the best salary if you are working as pharmacists but I don't care about that. So should I continue to get master and maybe PharmD in pharmacy or is the chemistry major/biochemistry major + PhD for research career? And I heard chemists don't get good salary? Is biomedicine careers better paying?
I'm also interested in physics and physical chemistry, maybe theoretical chemistry but I think there is not so many careers on those...

So my options are continuing pharmacy but I fear that I get stuck on retail or some (pharma)agency... I hate that our courses aims to retail work and that is why I would like to leave. Second option would be the chemistry and probably organic chemistry. Third would be the biochemistry. Is there any other choices maybe? I'm thankful for any replies!"
chemstation software and issues with 1100 series,2,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1504728732,True,"Hey y'all.  Our HPLC computer died awhile back, and we are trying to replace it.  We were able to borrow a disc that has Chemstation B.04.03 on it (we originally had A.06.01).  I have revived the communication between the computer and the LC:

1) I can ping the IP that bootp assigned to it
2) I can operate the LC via agilent's Lab Advisor software (e.g., turn on and off the pump and other modules).

However, when I load Chemstation, it says that no modules can be found.  I have tried reverting the firmware to older versions.  It seems the only module able to change is the autosampler (this is where the LAN is connected).  The others ""timeout when going into resident mode.""  That being said, even when the autosampler does change its firmware successfully, it still doesn't show up in Chemstation.

Any ideas?  I'm having trouble finding much information on the internet.

Also thank you.,87,363,False,False,False,chemistry,1504765785,True,"After 6 long years I have finally made it to the end of my PhD program (organic synthesis). I have since graduated and started working at a wonderful job that I could not possibly be more thankful for. 

I have wanted to be a chemist since I was very little, and I decided in high school that I was going to get a PhD. Why? Well, I liked chemistry, it was natural that I would learn as much as I could and continue to push the boundaries of knowledge. Little did I know how challenging it would be. I had an amazing adviser and a great support network, but I was severely marred by mental health issues and a project with challenges that just happened to poke at my insecurities more than others would have. I almost didn't make it to the end and wanted to give up countless times, but I held on because it's the only thing I knew: keep trying. The end DOES exist, and you *will* make it. Do not throw in the towel after your oral prelims. Keep chugging away as you've put too much time and effort into this.

I know this doesn't really ""capture"" the gravity and message I want to convey, but it's the best I can do. I'd say more but it's best not to give too much detail. If anyone is struggling with their PhD (now or in the future) and wants an ear/advice, or just wants to hear my story more, feel free to shoot me a PM and I'll get back to you when I have time.

I also want to say thank you to this sub. Several times over the years here I have reached out and posed some scientific road blocks I hit and wanted to query a broader knowledge base. I got lots of helpful responses, and it ended up being helpful in each case to varying degrees, and ended up acting as a grounding tool.

Realistically, do you guys know if a 175 in verbal and a 179 in math is good enough? With a essay score of I think 4.5 out of 6.

What would be the best places for him to go if he wants a phd and would that be possible given his scores? 

Let's say he has a 3.2+ GPA (I'm not entirely sure of this). 

Also I'm sorry if I didn't give all the necessary info.

[LabStory] Better Red than DEAD.,23,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1504956122,True,"Prelude: With regards to [the fellow chemist that needed stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/6yw76c/what_are_some_of_the_biggest_mistakes_you_or/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link), I felt that mine would be lost in a sea of 'You shouldn't feel bads' 

Storytime!
Last year, the second of my 4 year bachelor, I was following a lab course in spectrometry. One of the experiments I had to do was a glucose test of AA-drink with [o-toluidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-Toluidine). (I Will never forget how to spell that amine). Anyway the test involved a full rack of test tubes filled with that stuff, some high molar acedic acid (and some methanol I belive). 

Interlude: My (3 month) ex girlfriend was behaving weird, pushing me away. The day before the accident she suddenly snapped at me to a degree to where I stopped. Saw that I had one class left for the day, Walked out and took the first train to my grandparents (where my grandfather was recovering from surgery to an anurism). There I had a mental recovery good enough to go back to school with, still sleep was rather lacking. 

Back at the tube rack, my lab partner heated the tubes in the rack to about 60-80°C using a waterbath.
While hot, I had to pipette a dye into some of the tubes. I grabbed a large autosampler from the rack at the back of the fume Hood. And without paying enough attention, I pulled a sampler with the tip still on it, over the rack. The tip being transparant and virtually invisible, kicked the rack on its side. Spilling the entirity of its contents over my labcoat and left leg. 

I stood there, rooted for a second, next to the broken glass and fumehood not knowing what to do. 
And then I felt a tingeling on my leg that gradually kept getting warmer and hurting me more and more. I shouted at the labtech that I was covered in this stuff, went to the Sink at the far back, undressed to my underwear, ditched my labcoat next to my pants and sat in the sink. Running cold water over my left leg in only my T-shirt and [FERRARI RED underwear](http://www.colorhexa.com/ff2800.png) for over 20 minutes. 

During this time I talked to my prof, who stressed me that these things happen, she talked me into going to the closest clinic after I was done hosing my leg. 
During this eye opening one to one with me and the sink, the class was still going. Classmates taking a look, and a good friend taking Pictures of unknowing me in the sink, what good Friends are for. My prof handed me my phone so that I had something to do and to distract me from my leg getting numb from the cold water. 
I texted a friend of mine who was doing tox studies at the time. I told him what I got over me and he said that he'd take a look in his databases. 
2 minutes later I was laughing at 12 messages of ""Cancer of x in bodypart y"" 

After this I was handed [a white overall](https://www.thaly.eu/media/catalog/product/cache/2/image/750x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/m/i/microgard_2500_plus_overall_wit-826657100.jpg) and directed, through the entire school wearing a tshirt a semitransparant white overall and RED BOXERS to the car of my labtech, who took me to the clinic. Where ,suprise suprise, the doctor didnt know jack about what he could do. He tapped my knee to see if the nerves were dead and told me to stay off alcohol for the rest of the month. (incase the liver took a beating breaking all that I absorbed up). He told my I was lucky to be quick about it, as there was now certainly a werid striped scar on my knee. I phoned my mother, went back to school and collected the remains of my pants. [This is kinda what they looked like](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4b/b6/c2/4bb6c2fb96bb8ce6c96f3786c64d568b--ripped-jeans-style-very-ripped-jeans.jpg) but I don't look nearly as good in them as her.

Lessons Learned:

* Eat and sleep well before going into the lab, leave all your troubles at the front door, how hard that might seem.

* Don't be afraid to dress down. yes the entire classroom saw me in my beautiful red loincloth. But I'm more reliefed about the fact that I only have a scar the size of a pencil and not something worse. BETTER RED THAN DEAD.
 
* Friends are assholes, but you'll thank them later for the documentation.

* Appriciate your lab techs, you'll need them someday. 

Oh and don't wear red underwear..... ever"

Msc is considered to be closer to Bsc and an Msc is typically not considered for entry level PhD jobs regardless of years of experience. The thing is some of these things don't line up with ACS statistics. According to their statistics PhD has a lower unemployment rate, and Msc can make in the low 6 figures which is above PhD starting salary. Can anyone clear this up for me? Also if a Msc is considered to be similar to Bsc is it even worth getting or can an Msc reach higher ranks and pay then a Bsc with experience?"

covering large ppm ranges in NMR,5,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1505067556,True,"I've been running some paramagnetic proton NMR that results in very large ppm ranges for my resonances. My understanding is that pulse NMR targets the central frequency and using the time-energy uncertainty principle irradiates all resonances simultaneously. This seems to be fine in a typical experiment, but if I want to measure (say) from -100 to 100ppm will there be fundamental limitations of the pulse to effectively irradiate at large frequency ranges? Will the pulse maintain proper intensity across the whole range such that the integrations work properly?

heteronuclear NMR runs over large frequency ranges which suggests this shouldn't be a problem but I have been seeing bizarre spectra and want to knock out possible experimental issues.

I am trying to find a quotation from the early days of the development of quantum mechanics.

Not sure who it was by either, although I am pretty sure it was one of the giants of physics from back then.

I haven't had any luck with Google or my textbooks. Anybody know the quote I'm talking about?"

Hyperconjugation as one of the reasons accounting for lower energy for staggered conformation of ethane,6,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1505300799,True,"So I learnt previously that one of the explanations for the lower energy of the staggered conformer of ethane is the stabilizing interaction between the C-H sigma and C-H sigma* to form an extended molecular orbital.

The purpose of this is to become less isolated, and speak my mind and concern in an anonymous fashion to address what my next step should be.

I am an international student, I did my BA in Chemistry in the midwest, and entered a PhD program in a decently ranked school. Something to know about me is I am naively idealistic to a fault. My undergraduate experience was great and I had come into grad school with great momentum, truly wanting to help make the world a better place by being part of a team that solves real issues from a chemical stand point.

My idealism and naivety clashed hard with the reality of grad school as it might have happened to those of you who are reading. I joined a young faculty member who wasn't tenured and was submerged in the world of publication culture and the toxicity that comes with that. Long story short is I am incredibly jaded, I almost quit several times and I am truly exhausted mentally. Most days I want to wash my hands and soul off of all that is associated with the academic world and chemistry (but I can't due to being an international student, visa issues etc.), which makes me sad because it is truly something that I loved and still love to some extent. But the reality is I have become a shell of who I was. The biggest challenge in grad school was not the science but dealing with unhealthy people and the anxiety filled environment they nurture. 

I'm in my 5th year, my confidence has taken a beating and I'm supposed to be looking for jobs soon. I am reaching out to get advice on what to do. Government is a little challenging to join as an international student, industry is usually profit oriented (I'm hoping someone can refute that) and academia is ego oriented.

Question about HF acid safety?,9,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1505404684,True,In my lab we have an ion stock solution that contains 2% v/v HF acid. I rarely ever use this stock solution and when I do it's usually simply pipettinf 2 mls of the stuff into 100 ml volumetric flask for dilution.

Furthermore the standards I make from the 0.06% HF solution are diluted at a minimum by 200x so I'm most often using standards with 0.0003 % v/v HF. Should I be concerned about handiling 0.06 % or 0.0003 % v/v HF solutions? Is that enough HF to for example lead to long term exposure.

I was offered a funded masters position, with works out to about 22k / yr after everything, which is pretty good for Canada. The project would mainly involve organic synthesis, for the production organic electronic materials (OLEDs). 

For those of you with a masters, do you think it was worth getting?  I have read a lot of you are very happy after graduate school because you are able to do what you love. I did a few research placements during my undergrad, and while I did enjoy it, for the most part, I definitely didn't *love* it. 

From my undergrad experience, although I would be fine with it in the short term, I felt like I wouldn't want to be stuck working in a lab forever. I felt like I was more interested in consulting for something like environmental chem.

Do you think a synthesis oriented masters would hold value outside of lab work? Is the 2 years dedicated to a masters worth the investment at all in terms of opportunity and earning potential?

Quick disclaimer, I recently got my BS in chemistry and I'm the only chemist at the company I'm working for, so my experimental design tends to be only a small step above amateur.

I'm troubleshooting an issue where a mixture involving citric acid (not 100% sure this is even the problem ingredient) is interacting with inks on a package.  I wanted to try and understand which pigment(s) are being affected.  For my experiment, I added citric acid to a green ink that is made up of 3 or 4 different pigments, and what I was hoping would happen is that the inorganic pigments would bond with the citric acid and precipitate out and the organic pigments would stay in solution.  What ended up happening, though, is that everything precipitated out of the solution (ie I've got green solid precipitating out).  I tried this on a number of different inks, some of which I'm pretty sure are organic compounds, and same result each time.  Am I missing something here?"
Chemistry is my dream. But fate had another plan.,16,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1505434292,True,"Hi guys. I do not know if this is the right subreddit to post this,but I hope my post gets accepted. 

Well,I have loved chemistry since high school,I was excellent when it came to understanding the principles,I liked doing experiments in the lab and I love watching videos on youtube about chemistry.

So,when I had to decide in which university I'm going,of course I wanted a chemical department. But,sadly, (actually it's pretty complicated as I should explain the school system in Greece,which is something I'm not going to do) I couldn't be accepted in any department of chemistry ,but I am now in an applied mathematics & sciences department of the polytechnic school. 
I am pretty disappointed as there aren't any subjects related to chemistry and I have a strong feeling that I won't like these studies. 
You see,studying chemistry has been my dream for so long, and I want to pursue it no matter what. 

But,I'm a bit concerned when it comes to finding a job related with my field after getting a degree ( and a master probably). I honestly don't know which choice is the best when it comes to it. 

Right now I am seriously considering trying again this year and studying even harder so as to be accepted in a chemical department of any university in Greece. 

I would like your thoughts on this. Do you think I should go for it? 

I know that at the end of the day I should do whatever makes me happy. However,I would like to hear your opinion from a more subjective point of view. "

In order to know this, I must know the rules behind a chemical reaction being explosive. For example, h2o2 and acetone make a bomb not ethanol and h2o2, silver nitrate and ethanol too but silver nitrate and acetone dont. From what I see most cases require an oxidizer and a fuel. However, so many cases of fuel + oxidizer dont make any explosion. 

I'm not planning to make an explosive, there's no reason for it. I want to make sure I dont make one, and in order to make sure an explosive isnt made, I wanted to know how one can be made"

Cathode rays??,3,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1505564823,True,"If I've posted this in the wrong section, please tell me where I should go!

We're learning about cathode rays in school but I just can't seem to get my head around them so I'd appreciate any help I can get. I really don't want to be falling behind so early in the year.

So basically I'm wondering:

Are cathode rays invisible to the eye? Can we only see them if a fluorescent material is in place?

Since the cathode rays are coming from the cathode, is the anode necessary or will the cathode emit the rays without the anode?

Is the beam we see the cathode rays?

Do the cathode rays just travel between the cathode and anode? If so, how does the ray pass through the hole in the anode in Crookes' experiment??

I basically have to do 1 to 2 step reactions and isolate/purify the product and I have to achieve a certain yield and purity of the product. Simple undergrad stuff, right? While my yields are acceptable, it doesn't matter because I seem to be always messing up the purity. The melting point of the substances deviates by like 5-6°C from the normal value. I've been really trying my best to follow every instruction as carefully as I can, been paying extra attention to make sure my glassware is clean, but I just can't seem to get things right.

"Chemists working in academia, what is your current computer setup at work?",24,36,False,False,False,chemistry,1505581930,True,"Hey /r/chemistry,


I'm curious about your computer equipment at work, especially in academia. The background is that many programs in chemistry work better -- or even only -- on one specific operating system. For example, my preferred crystal structure visualiser (Diamond) only works in Windows. But Wien2k (electronic structure calculations of solids) runs best on Linux (or so my PI said). Then there is Topas academic for Rietveld refinements which again runs on Windows. 

I do realize that there are many many programs for each individual task and I'm not asking for ""is there a program like X for Windows"". But people have their own preferences. Maybe the group you worked in for 3 years worked on Windows and now you have to work on Linux and you have to get accustomed to very different programs?

That said, I've come across people who prefer to use their own PC over one provided by the university and vice versa., which is a whole other point. 

So my questions are:

1) Do you use your private computer/laptop or does your university provide one?

2) What is your operating system, do you use virtual machines?

3) What do you use your computer for? What are your most used programs?

4) Do you feel your computer is sufficiently powerful for your tasks?

Literature/resources on reaction conditions optimization? (Experimental design for synthetic chemists),16,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1505594940,True,"Hey all,

I've working on optimizing reactions for several years, everytime you ask someone how they do it, they usually take on the challenge in very different manners... Some just run experiments one after the other, and the information they get leads them to the next test, others just run a massive amount of paralel reactions at the same time, some like keeping X, Y and Z variables constant, others A, B and C, etc. 

So I am surprised that I had never come up with a paper on ""experimental design"" for synthetic chemists while developing/optimizing a completely new reaction. I know there is plenty of research about that in analytical chemistry journal, but I find all of them ""extremelly analytical"" (if you know what I mean), it is really hard to believe that there is no kind of ""guide"" of organic chemists, which actually let's you come up with a series of optimal experiments or ""plan of action"" for tackling new problems.

Let me know if you know any resource like this! I'd love to compare any approach with the one I use."

How to choose a research topic?,3,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1505753931,True,"Hello everyone! 

Long story short, I've found recently that in Bucharest (only 60km from where I live) there is a small research center for high school students (and the only one of his kind in my country) with very good results in science Olympiads. I've talked with the professor that organizes this activity and he told me that if I send my CV until the end of the week, I would be accepted (because I've got a bronze medal in the International Earth Science Olympiad)... but, here is the problem, he said I have to specify what would be the topic of my research.

I have no idea what to choose and I don't want to regret working for 1-2 years on a project I don't like because I made a rush decision, but on the other hand, publishing a research paper in high school seems an amazing opportunity. The only thing I know it's that I want to do something related to organic chemistry/biochemistry and I struggle finding a very specific topic. Also, looking at the titles of research papers published last year by other members (""Combating cancer with magnetosomes"" or ""Lipid structures in microelectronics and the transportation of drugs"") it's very intimidating...how can I come up something something so wow?

My ramblings about chemistry and why I love it.,15,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1505791776,True,"I pause and smile. Try to contain my excitement and the thousand thoughts that resonate in my head when someone asks me, ""So... why chemistry?"". My first thought, my all-encompassing thought is ""how could I ever not choose chemistry? It is mystery, it is life, it is haunting, it is surprise, it is just beauty, it is chaos and order all mixed up into one, and all that is fascinating and bridging between the living and the non-living world. It is what is directly responsible for our happiness, our beating heart, the viscosity of paints, the allure and beautiful scent of perfumes to basically all the comforts of the material, geological and biological world. It is just...so many things."". But I can't start there. Where do I start. I never know where to start. The truth is, I didn't choose chemistry as my first. I even used to hate it in high school, the reason was simple: I just didn't understand the point of it. That changed after I took an organic chemistry course as part of the pre-med program I was enrolled in. I remember sitting in the middle row of a lecture hall with 200 or more other students... the lecture began and the professor made a chilling introduction ""What is chemistry? Chemistry is...whatever you want it to be."". As someone who always wanted to independently trek her own path to the trails least traveled, to explore and to feel absolute freedom in her pursuits; that comment stuck with me. The idea that with my own hands I could make something that has never been made before. After delving through the subject more, reading page after page after page and absorbing all that I could about the subject, I knew that that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. So I made the change. The journey could be described as blood (literally), sweat (literally) and tears (literally)....but absolute bliss in the end. And I'd do it again if I had to.

You see, chemistry is real-life magic when you get it right. It is as much of a science as it is an art and a craft. It is a field with so little restriction... where the literal world is your playground. And your main boundary is whatever your creative limit is. When you get it right, when you make a difference with it, you make something great or discover something phenomenal...you are on an absolute thrill ride. And then it comes back at you...to humble you and crack your soul...and remind you that there is still so much left to learn. So you pick yourself up, dust yourself off and look past that tidal wave because at the end of the day you know that there is something great behind it. A discovery. It is a never-ending journey. And that's why I love chemistry."

Strange film/ bubbles when separating isopropyl alcohol into layers.,1,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1505803577,True,"I had made some dilute isopropyl alcohol a few weeks ago and I recently needed it a bit more concentrated. Since I don't have a way to safely distill it, I opted for using table salt to create two layers. I added enough salt to force two layers and, strangely, between the two layers, this thin film formed. Even more strange is that when the layers are shaken, these bubbles form that I can't explain. When the bubbles rupture, the membrane like exterior floats to the top of the aqueous layer. The ones in the picture have a grain or two of undissolved salt trapped in them, which is what I assume is weighing them down. I had diluted over the counter 90% isopropyl alcohol to about 50% with some distilled water. The table salt only contained salt and calcium silicate. Everything was added to a clean glass bottle and was stored in a cool, dark place for maybe 2 weeks. I'm not sure what's going on, but I thought it was interesting.

"How I learned not to smell stuff, a story about boredom and benzyl acetate",9,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1505804003,True,"Hey. I originally posted this a while ago in /r/TIFU, and stripped some stuff to post it here.

Happened a few months ago. Basically I'm learning chemistry by myself, since I'm studying computer science which doesn't involve chemistry lessons. I'd love to mess around a bit more, but eh French regulations make it illegal for private users to purchase useful compounds. BUT, when you're like me, there ARE exceptions. Like staying late in chemistry classes. (EDIT: I'm not in HS anymore :( )

Anyway, it's a H-O-T Tuesday. After class, I decide to stay in, so I can you know, enjoy the cold atmosphere with 2 of my friends and our Physics+Chemistry teacher. He was a chill dude, the funny teacher kind, but also a really experienced chemist with decades of experience. It was his last year before retirement, and as such didn't really care about getting ""kicked away"" or whatever, so our after-class thing wasn't really something he cared about.

So, quick presentation of the characters. I'm 17y old. I want to stay in class for the cold atmosphere. My first friend is 18 and also happens to be the *best* student in the entire freaking school. My second friend is... more lax to say the least. I don't recall seeing him open a book during the year. But eh, all three of us graduated with honours.

I had read a few days before an article on Jasmine oil. It's that amazing plant that smells amazingly amazing. Because of **Benzyl acetate**

Anyway. We want to synthesize this crazy thing. I mean, it'll take A LOT of time, but what's more rewarding that creating your own scent from scratch? Probably lots of things, but who cares. To synthesize Benzyl acetate, we need to make some benzyl alcohol undergo an esterification process with acetic acid. Benzyl alcohol is one hell of a toxic molecule for us, beginners. To quote Wikipedia: *Very high concentrations can result in toxic effects including respiratory failure, vasodilation, hypotension, convulsions, and paralysis.* We do not mess around with that. The teacher briefs us a bit on the thing, opens the window (unleashing hellish temperatures inside, but we already got all the stuff we needed out, we won't stop until we have the damn molecule synthesized) and gives us some safety equipment. But benzyl alcohol is only one of the two reactives, the other being acetic acid. So we don't really have to worry about it. Finally, we use a reflux heating system as well as some *sulfuric acid* to act as a catalyst. Note that we also use some cyclohexane instead of water to dilute everything.

So it's late, we're melting in this desert-like atmosphere, and we're mixing a bunch of dangerous (for us) chemicals together. What can possibly go wrong? Well after about 30 minutes of refluxing, we pour the resulting products in a separatory funnel and add some concentrated salt solution, so we can clearly separate everything once we're done, shake it a little, and WE'RE DONE. FINALLY. After some chromatography tests, we realize there's still some benzyl alcohol left. But, I mean, we're 17, we're not going to synthesize such complex compounds in such conditions. So we roll with it. Once it's done, I reach for the beaker, have a look at everyone, and get it closer to my nose.

And that's when the fuck up happens. I instantly regret my decision. This thing smells like a billion, rotten baby corpses who died from testicular cancer. I feel like a dark god is pulling my lungs into an infinite maelstrom of nightmares, my nose is clenching so hard I fear I'm going to die suffocating. Thisester isn't smelling sweet at all, it's torturing every single one of my smell receptors.

Now, now, you may think it's okay, we didn't make much. But NO. WE MADE 50 FREAKING MILLILITERS OF THIS GOD-FORSAKEN CHEMICAL CANCER. THIS THING SMELLED SO BAD YOU COULD QUARANTINE A GODDAMN CITY BLOCK. EVEN THE SYRIAN MILITARY WOULDN'T USE IT.

**TL;DR: Used leftovers chemicals after class to synthesize a benzyl acetate. Unleashed smellpocalypse.**"

The closest I have found so far is ""nutritional chemist"" but that seems to not include the fieldwork of a farm.

Perchlorate crystals dissolving in air,15,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1505929822,True,"This is a very generic and uncomplete question, as I cant disclose the counterion structure, so I know your answers can't be fully accurate. I would still appreciate if you threw ideas at me. The counterion is an heterocyclic N-rich molecule.
Alright, my question is as follows: why do you think that those crystals are stable in a diluite perchlorate solution but slowly dissolve (over 1-2 days) when in air?
What do you think might be the reactions involved?
I'm asking this because before resolving the crystal structure through diffractometry (is that even a term in english?) I was quite sure it was just water molecules leaving the crystal lattice. But we found no water molecules in the crystal lattice, just the perchlorate.
Thanks for any answer!

EDIT! Dissolving is not a correct term. The crystals remain solid but do not extinguish under polarized light, i.e. they are no longer birifrangent. They also look coated in a fine powder."

/r/chemistry book recommendations,15,27,False,False,False,chemistry,1505951095,True,"Hi /r/chemistry. I have a question about the book recommendations in the sidebar.

I'm a layperson with kind of an odd interest in chemistry. I'm legitimately interested in the topic, but in kind of a pop-sci way; much more about qualitative than quantitative. 

It isn't that I can't handle the math or the the other aspects (in fact I'm perusing a STEM career path) but simply that I'm more interested in broad principles than anything else. I just don't get a big thrill out of chemical calculations or drawing molecular diagrams, and since I'm a layperson, I'm not under any obligation to do that if I don't want to. So it sounds like the book list is ideal for me.

At the same time, I am interested into going into some depth if possible. Of course, there are always trade-offs of rigor when studying something without really putting the time in, but ideally I'd love to find something that goes a *bit* deeper than a really handwavy pop-chem book for the total layperson. Is that what I'm going to get from the booklist? If not, does anything like that even exist?

"Why is copper the only metal with its color, and would it be possible to make it ""redder""?",36,79,False,False,False,chemistry,1506007673,True,"I've been making jewelry - particularly rings - for a couple years now and have a crucible in which I can make my own alloys.

I've tried gold, zinc, and tin, and am considering getting some zirconium copper stock since it softens at about 250C lower than pure copper even at less than 1% zirconium content. 

Anyway, no matter what elements I add, it only detracts from that distinct warm copper hue, and I was wondering if there is anything I could add to the mix that would help negate the lightening of that color by the silvery elements.

I'm a first-year chemistry graduate student at a top 15 institution and of all the things that I braced myself for with graduate school (poor pay, long work hours, etc.) the only thing that has completely thrown me off guard is the amount of students in my sub-discipline giving me a hard time about the amount of time that I work or study.

What I find particularly confusing is that these are largely older students and not my immediate cohorts where I could perhaps see more competition. For clarification, these are all people that I've gotten to know through looking at potential labs or as roommates and so on and not department strangers. I'm starting to get sick of comments like ""Why are you studying so hard, that class isn't even that difficult"" or ""Why were you on campus this weekend when you haven't even joined a lab"" etc. 

Up until this point I've tried to be diplomatic since these are people that I'll be working directly with or among for the next 5+ years and graduate school is already toxic enough in terms of a work environment.

BA vs BS- in the job world does it matter?,11,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1506114342,True,"TLDR is the title

Background on me:
I'm looking to finish my BS chemistry degree and either work in formulation or get my master's degree in chemistry to do research in bioorganics. My GPA without math is a 3.5 and with the math I've taken I have a 2.77. 
Math. Is. Killing. Me.  Calculus 2 was the hardest thing I've ever done. I would rather have my teeth pulled than do that again.
And people say oh well you need it for chemistry so you may not be a chemistry major. I disagree, I can do all I need to do for q-chem, organic, inorganic and the general chemistry with little issues. I also did very well in stats so I'm ok with that end of things. 
I still need to take calc 3 and 4 if I'm going to stay a BS chem in order to take the harder version of physical chemistry. If I switch to BA chem I'm done with math and I take the easier version of pchem. 

I feel like given I'm not trying to work in the more mathy chemistry fields, the distinction between the two may not matter to a company. Is that correct? Does a BA put me at worse odds for getting into a master's program? 

Since I'm almost done do I suck it up, chance it, and hope I don't further wreck my GPA? Or is it time to accept my limitations and go BA?

5th Year Floater,9,17,False,False,False,chemistry,1506117029,True,"Hi folks, 

Writing to essentially vent frustration, ask for advice and explore other options with respect to my pursuit of my PhD in Organic Chemistry. 

Forgive the text wall. Trying to give sufficient context. 

Some important details about me:
-Just started fifth year in an organic synthesis research group, we also dabble in physical organic. 
-I am the only graduate student in the group for the last two years. We intermittently have an adjunct professor and a postdoc who do independent work under the guidance of the PI. 
- I have no first author publications, and I was gifted a second author on a paper I did nothing for. I also have very few promising projects at the moment. 
-I spend 50hrs in lab per week +/- 15 hours depending on a few factors. 
-PI is retiring due to age (in fine health afaik), and has not been much help to me personally since the start of my time here. 
-I was never offered by my previous labmates to work on a project with them, while they regularly worked with one another. Admittedly I arrived less skilled, but I had no prior training and received none from my peers. 
-I can satisfactorily duplicate published reaction, come up with novel research projects (not good ones, it seems), and otherwise feel that I have self trained to a point that I have the skills to graduate but no time and no satisfactory thesis/dissertation material to put together. I have hundreds of failed reactions all related to about 10-15 projects that have ranged between ""not working at all"" to ""working but unpublishable"". I will say that I could intake more of the literature, but I peaked two years ago and have since declined to looking at the ASAPs every month or so. 
-My personal diagnosis is utter lack of support, bitterness towards my ""chemistry luck"" and not enough time. I am expected to graduate at the end of Summer 2018. 

In general, I would appreciate some advice from fellow chemists who experienced similar things. Is it unreasonable for me to want to abandon everything at my current university and look elsewhere? Can I somehow throw together a dissertation with one weak publication (if I can get some of my current projects to start working)? If so, what should I start putting together?

For the courses I have taken already, I have taken organic back at my community college and enjoyed it a lot, I am taking inorganic and instrumental analysis and not enjoying either that much, and I am taking P. Chem and really enjoying it. Here is my predicament, I enjoyed organic from a while ago, but now P. Chem is looking very interesting to me because I love math and missed it from organic.

I have been reading online about job lookouts for P. Chem students and most people seem to say that they aren't the best. I really do enjoy it, however it is only my first course in the subject. I do have a time limit of two months for this decision so I do have time to decide, but I am just getting worried over the potential job outlooks for the future of my career.

So, are there any people out there who have been in a similar position as me, or even someone who is a P. Chemist and could comment on this? Maybe even a chemist who loves math and what they did with their research and degree. Any advice would be appreciated!"

I have an idea I'm working on getting patented but I have yet to make a working prototype. Regardless, I have so many preorders and interested businesses.

However the problem is I have yet to find a way or a lab that is capable of encapsulating marquis reagent or even concentrated sulfuric acid. These capsules need a proper shelf life and a high content of the reagent. 

Does anyone have experience with this line of work? I've already acquired 98% sulfuric and 37% formaldehyde that's stabilized with methanol I think at 15%. I've found very little information online about the chemistry of this reagent. I know each of the companies that sell it (way over priced) have slightly different formulations. If there was something I could add to make it still react as it should but easier to encapsulate? I also can't find it in bulk (1+ liters) so any leads on that would help. Though I don't mind mixing it myself. Any and all help finding variations on the formula for the reagent as well as microencapsulation would be very helpful.

It's been puzzling me for a while now, and the best explanation that I could think of is that it is mainly just the fact that hydride anions have a small s orbital that surrounds the hydrogen and is too small to interact well with carbon's orbitals, so it interacts with other hydrogen orbitals easier, but NaBH4 has its hydrides covalently bonded to the boron, with partial negative charges, so they have their orbital a bit ""stretched out"" towards the boron, so they can react with both earlier discussed things easier.

There are some impurities in the product and I ran a TLC today with 95 DCM and 5 MeOH, the plate did not look very good separation wide. I also tried 90/10 but still nothing solid. I was thinking of going with 60 Ethyl A. and 40% hexane. I am also adding a .1% of tryethylamine to neutralize the gel. My only gripe is the higher boiling of them being around 70 celcius. and being harder to rotavap out. Will that cause any trouble to my compund that has a bp of 100+ when I NMR or GCMS?

I was also reading some lit, and it said I should aim for a midpoint rf of 3.5 since I have two things I am trying to separate so I aiming for that.

Sorry if it sounds dumb, just getting the hang of this.Thanks in advance"

First of all, i know it's dangerous. I do that outside and with gloves, glasses, and mask.

The bleach I used has sodium hipoclorite.

Bleach residue and vinegar,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1506422043,True,"Hey Chemists, so I have an ongoing mildew and or mold issue. The short story is a attempted to disinfect a contaminated concrete closet floor with bleach and water (1/4 bleach) 

I wore a vapor rated respirator for this with a large fan blowing air out the bedroom window. 

After applying the bleach/water mix I dried the area out with a heater for a few hours and still smelled mold or mildew in the closet. 

I decided to try vinegar and sprayed it all over the closet and concrete floor. I did not wear a mask this time... 

I was wondering if I possibly created a hazardous gas situation due to possible residue left by the bleach that would've mixed with the vinegar? I still had the fan blowing air out the bedroom window though. 

For what it's worth the musty smell is way less than it was, I'm going to have to tear down the wall (there is a bathroom on opposite side) as I'm sure there is a water leak there but I was just wondering... Does dried bleach leave a residue that would mix with vinegar and create dangerous fumes? 

I do have a slight headache but I've been cleaning a gross basement suite for days, working nights, stressed out and a whole bunch of other issues that would cause a headache. No respiratory discomfort though."

I had to delete some base pairs, and the whole structure got messed up. Some existing loops got destroyed, and the whole structure looks... janky. I can no longer fix that with GaussView, I think, and Chimera isn't working either (Modeller keeps throwing a weird ""protein isn't there"" error)

In my lab (and in previous ones) convention seems to be vacuum on top, gas on bottom. However I feel that the vacuum on the bottom would be the better choice because you'd get less ""suck-back"" as there's less volume (lines to the taps are shorter) when purging, Obviously with a large container this will be negligible but if you were purging a 10 - 25ml RBF (which a lot of my reactions are done in) it'd probably be noticeable?

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

With the current implementation of the two molecule challenges, the synthetic products will be labelled with A or B and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference if it is a novel technique. You do not have to solve synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

Did you seek employment in that same area or another area? 

How long did it take you to become employed after graduation (undergrad and grad)? 

What type of positions are available in this job field?

What is it like to work in these positions based on your experience so far? Pros? Cons?

Is there growth and demand in this field?

Reaction heat of a LiNiMnCoO2 (NMC) Lithium-Ion Battery,0,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1506597151,True,"Hello, 

I'm trying to calculate the reversible reaction heat during charging and discharging of a Lithium-Ion Battery. Additionally Im trying to calculate the irreversible reaction heat of a battery that occurs as a result of high current. 

The positive active material of the Battery is LiNiMnCoO2 (NMC). 
The reaction equalation ist (M = Metal: Ni,Mn,Co): 

https://img1.picload.org/image/dgolrpdi/1.jpg

For the reversible heat during charging and discharging applies Q = dS * T. To calculate dS I need the Standard reaction enthalpy and the Gibbs free energy for Li Ni Mn Co O2. I would do it like in this picture: 

https://img2.picload.org/image/dgolrpww/rev_waerme.png

Here is an other example for calculating the heat during charging and discharging of a Nickel-Metalhybrid (NiMH) battery: 

https://img2.picload.org/image/dgolrwiw/nimh.png

https://img2.picload.org/image/dgoldgal/nimh_2.jpg

Result: 

dS * T for 25 °C Q1 = dS * T = 29,3 kJ/H2 mol 

They also calculated the irreversible heat, as a result of reaction of the electrolyt with the electrons occurs as a result of high current: 

https://img1.picload.org/image/dgoldrow/nimh_5.jpg

Results: 
Standard reaction enthalpy dH = -285,9 kJ/mol 
And for the reversible heat T * dS = -48,6 kJ/mol (bei 25 °C) 

They also use this equalation, I'm not sure why: 

https://img3.picload.org/image/dgolddgw/ninh6.jpg

To calculate the reaction heat that occurs as result of high current, they used dH: 

Qreact = dH 

Gibbs free energy: dG = dH - dS * T. 

dS * T describes the Transformation of during charging and discharging emerging Energie in heat and dH the Transformation of the energy in mechanical work. I think this is the reason why they used dH. 

Chemistry is not my strongest skill, so i would be glad, if someone could help me.

"If you were to colour in the Periodic Table with the colours of the elements themselves, would a pattern emerge?",9,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1506609211,True,"Inspired by reading this from the [Wikipedia article on gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Color):

&gt;Whereas most metals are gray or silvery white, gold is slightly reddish-yellow. This color is determined by the frequency of plasma oscillations among the metal's valence electrons, in the ultraviolet range for most metals but in the visible range for gold due to relativistic effects affecting the orbitals around gold atoms. Similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic caesium.

Of course, an element might be different colours depending on whether it is solid, liquid or gas.  So let's imagine we do three charts, one for each state, and let's suppose we use the most stable isotopes.  Would we see a lot of things with a golden hue in a line?  Would the greyish elements be clumped together?"

I am currently involved in a discussion about how to move forward with a project.

Alright. So, I thought that spatially-resolved XPS (the vendor claims a spot size of 10 um of the x-ray beam) might be accurate enough for this, but my collaborator is adamant that XPS has no spatial resolution and that this is impossible.

"How to think about reaction mechanisms, and a question about an NMR of the Sn1 mechanism protonated OH or carbocation intermediate?",2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1506869039,True,"So, most of us here probably know that, even with factoring out the error in human perception, there is a lot of controversy, mainly through opinions in science, on theories, and/or what is and isn't proven.  Chemistry is included in this, but it fortunately is a very provable field of science in many ways, as, for one, you can do a reaction in front of you, get the results you predicted from previous experimental data and/or experimental data made laws/rules, even without doing that reaction itself before, and, if following the same procedure, keep getting the same result, which is a large basis of science.  You can use all kinds of devices, like thermometers, pH testers, or even NMR Spectroscopy or X-Ray Crystallography, etc., to figure out the composition, and even structure of your products.  On the topic of reaction mechanisms, they are important especially for rate laws in general chemistry, and some pure chemistry, but are not just for rate laws in organic chemistry, they are also for reaction prediction, pure chemistry, and many other both pure and applied science things.  I have seen many papers written on the following topic: Virtually anyone learning organic chemistry learns mechanisms, and are commonly told, or realize, to see them as theory, but theory that has very heavy basis in previous experimental data, especially ones that make up the bulk of scientific laws/rules.  They are also commonly told to see mechanisms as the most likely possibility, as scientists before have worked to rule out other possibilities, which is normally counted under the ""proven"" category, to get the final solid theory that is the approved mechanism, from the earlier proposed mechanism.  Now, I'm not saying that some tiny amount of weird intermediates won't form and/or some tiny amount weird products may form in almost any reaction, mostly through some one-off mechanism/pathway, but the approved mechanism, like SN1, Aldol Condensation, the Mannich Reaction, E1, SN2, Fischer Esterification, etc., is, from the previously stated scientific laws/rules from experimental data and other scientists experiments to rule out other possibilities, the most likely possibility of what takes place most frequently in the real-life reaction.  Another note to add, many mechanisms, like in the case of how either H2O, HSO4, alcohol, and another carboxylic acid molecule could all remove the hydrogen in a reaction, with varying degrees of possibility, but only one is normally shown in a mechanism.  Although true, this is not necessary to show in a mechanism, as this can typically be figured out by whoever is looking at the mechanism, and it is nitpicking on my part.  Also, most people who have an interest in chemistry, especially organic, likely think mechanisms are really cool, it's really neat to see how reactions take place at the molecular/atomic level, I know I think that it's one of my favorite parts of chemistry.  So, to cut to the chase, I was wondering if anyone knows of a fast NMR done on an SN1 mechanism that shows a protonated OH group or a carbocation intermediate, I just thought that it would be pretty cool.  **TL;DR:** Reaction mechanisms are theory, but aren't just willy nilly, they normally have great basis in experimental/observational data and scientific rules/laws done by scientists, and are to be looked at as not the only path that molecules could take to form products, as some strange intermediates and products may be found in miniscule amounts, but mechanisms are the extremely likely path that will mostly be happening in a reaction, this is all referring to approved mechanisms of course, such as Fischer Esterification, after the other ones have been proved to be ruled out, or realized to be less probable.  Either way, it is really cool to know what is happening between most molecules on the molecular/atomic level in a reaction that I can do in front of myself, that is my favorite part of mechanisms.  Anyone else here like that that too?  Also, this got me thinking, does anyone have an NMR of an SN1 mechanism reaction that shows a carbocation/protonated OH?  I think that would be pretty neat.  **Significantly Mentionable Edit:** A note, if anyone is wondering why what you are reading may sound familiar, a lot of the discussed concepts are from a lot of different papers that I've been reading recently, but especially from this one: [ACS Link](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed086p551) and [Direct PDF from ACS Link](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed086p551) Edit 2: Sorry, I had a lowercase n in the places were I said SN1 and SN2, it's fixed now, besides the title, obviously."
What are my option to move my career forward as a synthetic chemistry? (Boston),6,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1506873189,True,"Hi guys, 

To cut a long story short: close to the end of a year long full-time internship in synthetic chemistry, 1-2 years of somewhat minimal experience in undergrad in synthetic chemistry as well. GPA is north of 3.5. 

Have had no luck securing a job in synthetic chemistry. Rarely get to the interview stage, never got the offer. 

Are there any resources available for me to gain additional lab experience in synthetic chemistry? Preferably in total synthesis, methodology, chemical biology or medicinal chemistry locally to Boston? I understand that ""go to grad school"" is the most reasonable answer here - but I would really like to wait at least one year to go - for several reasons. 

Some institutions have post-bacc programs (such as Broad Institute) - but those are specific to biology, it seems. I haven't easily found anything else. Seeing as I am recently graduated, I don't qualify for co-ops or internships at this stage (most require that you return to school in the following semester/year). 

My current plan is to reach out to professors in the area, but I need to pay for at least my rent and I doubt professors have the funds to take on research assistants (maybe I'm wrong?). Are there other avenues I can explore here?

Otherwise, I'm going to have to take whatever I find (non-chemistry if need be) in order to just put food on the table and keep a roof over my head.

Major in computer science or IT. Hell, if you love life sciences and want to be a doctor, major in biomedical informatics! At least you'd still work in a hospital, maybe. I regret not choosing to major in computer science, and now I'm trying to correct my mistakes. I have learned a few languages and plan to go to graduate school for bioinformatics.

**Nucleophilicity in polar protic solvent**


I- &gt; Br- &gt; Cl- &gt; F-


So generally, the more electronegative the element, the weaker is the nucleophilicity (as in F- &lt; OH- &lt; NH2- &lt; CH3-). If this is the case, why is F- more nucleophilic than I- in a polar aprotic solvent? Is there a sweet spot for polarisability versus electronegativy?"

Is it possible to get into a decent PhD program with my background?,7,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1507004163,True,"Hello everyone,

I am applying to dozens of chemistry graduate programs in the US right now but I wonder if my application has any chance of being accepted by a top 50 program.

My GRE scores are: V-160, Q-154, AW 3.0

TOEFL: 113/120

GPA: 3.1 general, 3.6 in chemistry

I have been involved in research since sophomore year in college and I hold a MS degree in chemistry, but my home institution is small and unfortunately I couldn't make any publications out of it, only presentations in small symposia. I can also get 3 good letters of reference from faculty members and my advisor. Another plus in my application is that I have studied one year in the US as the recipient of a scholarship (studying abroad is really rare in my country) and receive other small scholarships throughout my 'career'.

Is there anyone who have been in a similar situation and got in a decent PhD program? Do I stand a chance?

ps.: my research interest is in the field of organometallic catalysis and new synthetic methodologies

pKa in organic acid-base extractions,9,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1507038406,True,"Hello everyone, I am having a bit of trouble understanding this so some guidance would be appreciated. It was discussed in lecture that pKa and pH have a relationship such that an acid with pKa 10 will be acidic in solutions of pH &lt;10 and basic in solutions with pH &gt;10. Thats fairly simple enough and straight forward. But now that I am doing acid-base extractions in lab I am slightly confused. Upon adding an organic acid and base, wouldnt the pH inevitably cause at least one of the compounds to dissolve in the aqueous layer? or is the addition of acid in this case not to alter the pH pKa equillirbrium, but to simply cause an acid base reaction and from a protonated organic base.

The question arose when I was considering that the organic base, organic acid, and neutral compound have three different pKa's and I was curious if one should try to manipulate the pH to pass the pKa threshold of one compound but not others.


Basically, how does the pH and pKa relationship matter than the compound isnt in solution in one form?

Thinking about getting either an ozone generator or a hydroxyl generator - both air purifiers. Ozone is way cheaper and covers a lot more space. Seems like $70 USD for 4,000 sqft. The ozone downside is that you cannot be in the area - it's toxic. Hydroxyl is expensive ($350 - $450 and covers maybe 1,500 sqft) but can run while you are in the area.

How to corrode bronze?,2,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1507080887,True,"Hello chemists of /r/chemistry,

And let's say the university's faculty is about as evasive about answering: Who has the authority to take the statue down? How do we petition, assemble, etc. against the statue's standing on our campus? Why won't they take it down? Additionally, let's say that in one of her deflections, the university's Chancellor mentioned that one way the statue could be taken down (if not the only way) would be if the State inspector deemed the statue was a public safety hazard, i.e. if it rusted to the point of potentially falling over.

Welcome back to Week 38 of Synthetic Challenge!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

With the current implementation of the two molecule challenges, the synthetic products will be labelled with A or B and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference if it is a novel technique. You do not have to solve synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

Question about the Aqua Regia solution,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1507412121,True,"I was looking through and reading some materials about Aqua Regia and how the combination of Nitric Acid and Hydrochloric Acid can dissolve Gold, Platinum and other sorts of noble metals.

I understand that Nitric Acid is fully required as it is what oxidizes and dissolves gold in the first place. However, my question is: 

Is it really necessary for the HCl to be present? That is to say, can another source of Cl^- perform the same functions as HCl?

Of course, perhaps having the additional H^+ ions from HCl may help accelerate the process, but my question is on the **necessity** of the HCl. Can the dissolving of gold still proceed with only Nitric Acid and a different source of Chloride ions?

Question about ionic radii size,1,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1507579953,True,"The size of a lithium cation is 76 pm, in my chemistry textbook or 90 pm on wikipedia, which is about approximately half or so as small as a neutral lithium atom. Electronically, lithium+ is similar to helium where it has 2 electrons, or a filled 1s shell, so wouldn't one think that lithium+ should have a smaller radii size that helium from the greater coulombic force of the 3 protons of lithium+? However this isn't true since helium has a atomic radii size of roughly 32 pm. Why is it that lithium+ is bigger than helium?
I asked some people and they said that empirical measurements of ionic radii size is not consistent, for example, in x-ray crystallography, if you chose a certain element as your basis, it can change the measurement of ionic radii size of the thing you're trying to measure. That's why lithium+ has various sizes. But looking at all of the different empirical numbers, lithum+ is still bigger than Helium which I think should be theoretically smaller unless I'm neglecting something.
The only other thing I can think of to explain this is the difference in principle quantum number of helium and lithium. Helium has n=1 and lithium has n=2, and the principle quantum number, I believe, attributes the average distance of the electrons from the nucleus. If an electron was ionized of off a neutral lithium, it's principal quantum number will still be n=2, but have one less electron. So since it's still n=2, it will be larger than helium which is n=1?

Electronic Band Theory,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1507604282,True,"I’m struggling to understand how an electronic band arises, to give rise to a valence band or conduction band.

My current understanding goes like this(Let’s start out with 2 atoms):

When both atoms are isolated, their valence electrons occupy an energy level depending on the subshell they lie in. When the valence orbitals of both atoms overlap, an energy split is occurs where there are now two orbitals: one of lower energy level and the other of higher energy level. The valence electrons thus occupy the lowest and fill to the highest level. In this sense, there are only two energy levels available(lets give them arbitrary values of 10 for the lower energy level and 20 for the higher energy level.

Hi everyone and welcome back to Week 39 of Synthetic Challenge!!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

With the current implementation of the two molecule challenges, the synthetic products will be labelled with A or B and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference if it is a novel technique. You do not have to solve synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

Should I trust current/former group members to tell the truth?,14,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1507705750,True,"Hi, r/chemistry. Let me first say, you all are an inspiration and seeing the amount of advice that gets put on here is amazing considering how busy all of you likely are. 

I'll be frank, I just got out of a somewhat toxic/unhealthy lab environment. The bad experience I had while in that lab has taught me to research a PI as much as possible to see what I am getting into. 

I applied to a new lab today and got a response within 2 hours. Awesome! I also messaged a couple of people in advance to see how the PI was as a person/mentor and the responses were pretty favorable. They said the PI was supportive, helpful, reasonable about hours, can be tough but  overall a good PI. Their responses were fairly detailed too.

That said, others had a different view. The main thing they had to say was that the PI was hard on undergrads. I didn't contact these individuals directly but someone who interacts a lot with chemistry alumni threw it in when I asked him about the lab I was applying to. 

So, can I trust any of these evaluations? I've read on here to exercise extreme caution whenever someone says that their lab is perfect because they're trying suck you in so they can leave. I personally would never lie about my feelings toward a PI at least in private. 

Sorry if this comes off as neurotic and being worried about nothing but I had one bad experience and I don't want it to happen ever again. Thank you. "

Job qualifications,11,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1507848729,True,"Hello,

In your experience how many employers have asked to see transcripts as part of a job application? Furthermore how often have you applied for jobs that specifically asked for a B.S. instead of a B.A.?

What I'm curious about is how relevant those two things are once you've been working in the field for a while.  

For me I did not achieve the greatest academic success, I was jaded in college as far as my ability to be focused on grades, I ended up with about a 2.7 in chemistry classes. I also switched to chemistry after two years of pursuing a different degree. 

I did however work hard to find my way into becoming a lab assistant within the first few months of switching to pursuing chemistry. I then was approached by a professor who saw my potential to join his research group, applied and made it in. I spent about 10 months working in his lab every week. Sometimes I would put in 30-40 hours a week. 

After funding ran out I got myself an internship at an analytical lab during the last year of school where I worked for a year.  

Two days after graduating I landed myself a job as a lab technician doing basic analytical chemistry and have been working there since. I am approaching two years at this job.  

Recently I applied for a job and it happened to have already been filled. In the email I learned that there would be a job opening for somebody with a B.S. in Chemistry. For me the difference between getting my B.A. vs a B.S. was two physical chemistry lab classes and having a 3.0 in gen chem, organic and calculus. 

Outside of the requested degree type I believe I could do the job. 

Would it still be reasonable to apply? Do you think my effort and real life experience would carry more weight than the grades I earned two years ago? "

I made a post a while back about possible career possible opportunities in chemistry. I'm looking for more advice!

Since then I've graduated and am gearing myself towards patent law.

I am aware this is a highly competitive field so I'm looking for ways to bolster my CV towards these opportunities.

Thus far I believe my options are:    
1) Take the GDL (Graduate Diploma in Law for my yankee friends) this is more viable than 4 since scholarships are available.    
2) Advance to PhD in Chemistry (I specialised my masters in computational chem.)    
3) Learn another language    
4) Pay for and sit patent designations  (To my knowledge these are expensive and best done once the graduate position is achieved)    

Out of these (of which, 3 I plan to attempt simultaneously) which option would provide me with the best career prospects in this field? I'm grateful for any advice you guys can give which includes options that I am perhaps unaware of.

* When people keep leaving graduated cylinders in the base bath, so all the markings have been etched off.

* Removing DMF of DMSO or some other high-boiling-point solvent.

* When your institution doesn't subscribe to a certain journal, and Sci-Hub for some reason only gives you the SI and not the actual paper.

* You're reading a paper that is riddled with obvious mistakes and skimps so much on the details, it's about as good as used toilet paper, when suddenly you get an email saying that the paper that you worked your ass off for was rejected.

Are there any alloys that are made stronger by the addition of silver?,9,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1508060198,True,"I've been playing some video games (mainly The Witcher 3) and done some research on my own.


Silver is a very soft metal and you wouldn't really be able to make a sword out of it.


You could plate a steel sword with silver, but after even a few parries and blocks you'd need to re-plate it, making plating a very poor (and expensive) choice for silver swords.


I also read that hitting metal with a hammer repeatedly makes it very tough, like gold, you have to re-heat it every so often to make it malleable enough for jewelry. But monster hunters encounter all sorts of creatures, including ones that get hot, so cold tempered silver isn't a viable option either.


My last thought was working silver into the metal, like damascus steel, a single layer of the damascus process would be silvered, but that would compromise the structural integrity of the blade and it'd be more likely to bend in a wrong place or shatter altogether.


Is there any alloy or other process in which an effective silver sword would be viable other than those I've already mentioned?"

Tips and Life lessons for a new PhD student ?,23,55,False,False,False,chemistry,1508088939,True,"Dear fellow Chemists

After a BSc and an MSc in chemistry and in the chemistry of polymers and materials respectively, as well as various internships, I am finally starting my PhD in applied Materials Chemistry. This is a position that I have wanted to have for many years due to the skillset required and expected to have to do good research, the creativity and knowledge required to be able to propose my own projects or research routes but also to quench (somewhat) my thirst about making of novel chemical technologies as a full time job.
My question to you PhD holders and current PhD students is: what are the best lifehacks and life-lessons that you acquired during your PhD that made your life better and more effective as a researcher and more specifically in the following areas:
1. Literature reading
2. Lab note taking
3. Experiment design and creation
4. Start of new projects
5. Frustrations and hardships
6. Any other category you may think of

I highly appreciate your opinion and concentrated wisdom.
Best to you all!!

Lately I have started using Gaussian (with ChemBio3D) for calculating HOMO-LUMO energies. I am using B3LYP/6-311++G** for most calculations and it appears that most energies that I am getting are positive, which is weird to me since most papers I've seen show both HOMO and LUMO that are negative.
From looking that up I read that negative energies are considered to be bonding, while the positive are anti-bonding orbitals. Is that actually correct?
That made me wonder - what is actually the zero point? By that logic it sounds that non-bonding orbitals are zero, but isn't zero supposed to be vacuum? How can I use those calculation to compare with other systems (experimental or theoretical) that are normalized to vacuum?

Looking for high efficiency quantum dots/ SS phosphors for attempt at world's brightest flashlight (450nm -&gt; 555nm),8,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1508166893,True,"So over a year ago I had the bright idea (hehe) to build a big ass flashlight that involved dumping 200W of blue laser light into a vat of fluorescent chemicals in order to make the world's brightest flashlight. In short, I wanted to use green light because it is much brighter to the eye per watt than white light, and green LEDs currently suck in efficiency so converting the output of very high efficiency blue laser diodes seemed like the best idea. I tried fluorescein, but it has the unfortunate property of falling into a metastable triplet state that kills emission when you pump it (like seen in dye lasers)

Here's a vid of my first attempt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8csTQLw1rM

Now I want to try something that isn't solution based, because I'm afraid I'll see these triplet states in about any organic dye I use. I'd like to try either quantum dots or a solid state phosphor suspended in liquid, like maybe one of these from sigma:
http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/900437?lang=en&amp;region=US

I am having trouble finding relevant spectra (excitation/emission) for the phosphors from sigma though. Does anybody have any recommendations for a SS phosphor or quantum dot that absorbs strongly at around 450nm and emits near 555nm (photopic peak) ? 

I will also say that if you work in a lab that makes a quantum dot / SS phosphor like this, I would happily accept a sample for use in a video that could get your lab some extra publicity... :)

It is normal iodized table salt. The water was straight from the tap and was microwave for about minute to make it hot.

Happens w/ internal mouse, and 2 other external mice. I disabled the onboard mouse, as well, and it sill happens will only 1 external mouse connected.

Photoshop drop down menus stay open, and so do websites.

I'm currently attempting to check for the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons via fluorescence, but there isn't a whole lot of info out there (probably for a reason).  I found a 1976 article and another from 1986.  

I understand that I can't verify individual species, but is it possible to tell if it does have aromatic hydrocarbons using fluorescence spectroscopy?  I filtered the sample with a glass fiber filter and ran at various excitation wavelengths (242, 253, 266, 375nm) and got back some data, but I don't really know how to interpret it.  

Interestingly, every excitation wavelength had an emission peak at ~420nm.  There were others as well for each individual excitation.  

I understand that this is not ideal; this is just a learning free-time project for me and I am using the equipment that is available to me.  

Might it be better to concentrate the samples into an organic solvent using a C18 cartridge?

Seems TG and water have a non zero summing volume relationship?  
  
The error is not major and probably could compensate in a trial/error way but...   
  
Wondering if I have missed something or if there is a way to compensate for this in a formula?

Volume formula v/v%:  TG 20%, H2O 80%

SPE Question Regarding Wetting/Detwetting,4,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1508465850,True,"Hi gents,

I'm having to develop my extraction abilities to an area I'm unfamiliar with and that's SPE! In this context I'm talking about commercial silicon based or polymer based cartridge columns that are to be used with a vacuum manifold. My reason for SPE is extracting various biological compounds from tissue matrices. 

When it comes to adding solvents are you supposed to chain solvents in a manner that keeps the sorbent covered with liquid at all times?

Ie do I need to stop a column from fully eluting a wash buffer before I add my elution buffer? Or can I pull the wash buffer through, stop cock the column, then add elution buffer and reverse the stop cock?

I'm really confused about the period a column sorbent can be left without solvent, or under vacuum, without de-wetting. Also the difference in dewetting times of silicon vs polymeric sorbets have between them.

She warned me about an issue that various scientists/researchers (and the company she worked for I guess) had been struggling with and that the majority of Silicone manufacturers/engineers do not mention (she couldn't say whether this issue was solved for obvious reasons but just that it took several years)

The conversation was very technical so I might miss something out (we were on the phone for an hour and five minutes!)

Essentially she said to me that due to the layering system I am intending to use with different shore &lt;0 hardness, RTV2 addition cure, medical grade Silicone gels that I would run into the same problem these people had using the same method (layering and curing different gels on top of each other inside a mold).

She mentioned the different molecular weights between the gels caused each layer to swell or shrink. So the top layer would shrink/wrinkle out of it's moulded shape because the layer below it had swelled, also out of it's shape.

She never stated how much swelling and shrinkage occurred but she sounded like it was a very serious issue to overcome. I remember mentioning that this sounded similar to osmosis but in a different system with no membrane, she wouldn't confirm or deny that.

From my limited knowledge of chemistry I've acquired so far, what this lady is describing sounds like osmosis but not. It sounds like, over time (days, weeks, months?) post cure the different Mwt* of the silicone gel layers in the casting are trying to achieve equilibrium between them, with the higher Mwt gel losing atoms to the lower Mwt gel causing the shape of the silicone cast to warp/deform.

Does this sound close at all? Would anyone like to share an opinion on this and how to stop it happening? My first initial thought to ask her was, ""WHY not just paint a thin barrier of something in-between the layers to stop this transfer happening?"" It can't be that simple though? Plus there's the added problem of finding a similar material to the gels that will bond with them, is flexible/stretchy/soft but that isn't silicone itself.

Thank you for reading! Any help on this would be greatly appreciated as it's for a good cause! (I am trying to develop a more realistic mammary prosthesis prototype to help mastectomy survivors and the transgendered.)

*If Mwt=molecular weight=molar mass...Aren't weight and mass mutually exclusive?

Why chemistry?,29,12,False,False,False,chemistry,1508533054,True,"I’m currently a graduate student in the masters of chemistry program and I will graduate next semester, however, I still plan on pursuing my PhD. I’ve been thinking a lot about what drew me to my field and why I love it so much. For me it began my second year of college when I realized just how much chemistry is involved in an array of both real world and theoretical applications. I saw chemistry everywhere and I was stunned by the sheer power of it. I didn’t fully decide to major in chemistry until I saw Breaking Bad. Wait- don’t get any ideas, I’m not a chem major because I want to make meth or explosives. Breaking Bad was a turning point in my indecisiveness to which major I should claim. I knew it had to be science. I loved science and I thought it would lead me to become a med student some day. Time passed and I continued to take more chem courses: Ochem, Pchem, etc. Along with watching Breaking Bad something clicked. I fell in love with the pure science of chemistry and not so much it’s applications in medicine. I wanted to know as much as Walter White in the show. I wanted to know how to transform matter and truly understand it’s “mechanisms” so to speak. I’ve fallen in love with chem and I know that’s all I want to be, a chemist. I’ve been studying it for years and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. So my question to you guys, is why did you choose chemistry as your major, career, etc. What drew you to this central science and what do you love most about it? "

Predicting NMR spectra/ Am I on the right track?,5,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1508612739,True,"1. Vinyl bromide . I predict that the first peak would be 3 peaks for the carbon that is attached to bromide, with area of one. And the second peak after that to be the other carbon with 2 peaks and area of two.

2. 1,1,4-bromobutane

I would insert a picture if I could but I can't seem to find out how. I predicted that the first peak would be the carbon attached to 2 bromides and have 3 peaks, then the second peak to be the carbon next to the one with 2 bromides , then the next peak would be the one with one bromide, and the last peak to be the one next to the carbon with one bromide . 

My question is is my order of peaks right ? Or would it be 1. Carbon with 2 bromides 2. Carbon with one bromide 3. Carbon next to carbon with 2 bromides 4. Carbon next to carbon with one bromide . Or something else ?

Making rust out of steel wool.,4,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1508706367,True,"I don't know much about chemistry so I'll have to ask you guys for advice. As you've guessed I'm making rust. Which is to be used for my plastic models. This is what I did ==&gt;
1. I thoughrally cleaned the steel wool to get rid of the soap.
2. I let it sit in for 24 hrs in a plastic container with water just water.
3. Unsatisfied with the speed of the oxidation, steel wool looked unchanged, so I added salt to begin with. Things close to the sea rust faster so a good start.
4. Know comes the part I'm unsure about. I added an amount of bleach( it said sodium hypochlorite on the back) to the solution and let it sit. I read it releases oxygen into the water when it ""decomposes?"". Great! But I also read it can release harmful gases, whops should probably take that outside. 
5. This is the next step, when the steel has actually formed rust. So I plan to let the water evaporate and then I have  my rust powder. But does the bleach go away? I can't find anything on the internet that suggests it will, or do I have to neutralize it?

Non-spectral interference by eie in ICP-OES,0,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1508852292,True,"Hey,
I'm working on the effect of eie especially on the determination of K. For that I made a synthetic sample majorily containing Li and Ca that both affect the sensitivity of the determination significantly.
I am able to obtain the true value using an ionization buffer but also tried to dilute my sample to attenuate the effect of eie. If I plot the obtained concentrations vs the dilutionfactor I get an exponential fit that approaches a certain value that I expected to be the true value. Sadly that is not the case. The concentration for hypothetical infinite dilution is significantly different from the true value. 
Is my assumption wrong that I can estimate the true value this way? "
I seriously need help and I don't know where to turn,24,11,False,False,False,chemistry,1508852602,True,"I posted in the general thread and I just had people telling me to get therapy (which I'm already doing) but I need actual academic and career advice or I'm going to explode. I'm in a really dark place and I could use some advice because I feel completely alone. I'm 20. Junior in college studying chemistry. I'm currently doing research in a lab and it's basically my own project, which is nice. I've wanted this, and I got it. But today was my first day at the facility running samples with this instrument (I've done a lot of similar work, but never with this) and I forgot my notes from last time and oh my god, did I get a ribbing. The head of the lab basically kept asking why I even came, or if I even cared, and I was seriously on the verge of crying the entire time. I fucked up, I know, but I felt so trapped and he literally wouldn't stop insulting me over it the whole 2 hours.


So there's that. I learned my lesson. But I just feel like I'm fucking up everything in my life right now. This is my third undergraduate research lab so far. The first ended up being a field I didn't enjoy, the second gave me no project or anything, just had me doing grunt work, and I'd already done a great project at an internship and I couldn't go back to doing nothing, plus I'd really like to have something to show for my work (or a presentation, or publication, or anything, like all my friends have), but it was a prestigious lab so I should have stuck around.... they also didn't give me hours and I was required to have hours for my credit. Like, I needed 15 hours and I got maybe 2 a week. I found another lab over the summer via networking, started in there, and I'm basically continuing the summer work now with a collaborator. And it's mine.


I've not published. I've had one internship, one which I got an offer to go back to and turned down because I'm the world's biggest dunce and I thought that it'd be a bad idea to stay in one place. Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. I seriously fucked up, and I don't know what to do there. I've applied to different jobs. I interviewed with a startup today and I don't know how that went, but they want someone year round and I can only do a summer gig because I'm working on a project right now. I want to work in industry, but I already let go of my only industry connection I had. I want to publish. I want to present my data at a conference. I want to be *good* and everyone around me is being good and I'm running out of time.


I feel agonized. I don't know how else to put it. If it were capable, I would legitimately beat myself up. Literally, that's how I feel. I have never hated myself this much in my entire life. I'm a B student (3.1 and rising, but probably not by much), my grades aren't even that good. I also have two Ws (one was because of a major switch, the other was death in the family... excuses, I know) and two retakes (new grade, which is good, but the bad grades, one which was failing, are still on there, just not in my GPA. But grad schools consider those and they'll fuck me). So grad school is out. I used to be good at so much. I started in the lab in high school and I was taking college courses and giving talks and I was on top of the world, but that version of me is dead.

Is my experience I have so far even worth anything if I don't have a paper/presentations? I'm hoping that this year is the year that I can actually at least *try* to publish and present my data at a conference/forum, because I'm literally the only person in my circle who hasn't done that despite working in a ton of labs (for nothing, as it turns out). I'm terrified that my degree will be worthless and that I'll never have a real, stable career. I don't think that I'm being irrational here, and I need advice moving forward before I ruin my life even more than I already have. "

Anyone know a good exothermic reaction with relatively safe products (and catalysts),5,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1508854226,True,"So I need a good, safe, exothermic reaction for a club project I'm doing. The products need to be relatively safe at high temperatures. I basically need to get whatever I'm heating up to around 70-80 degrees Celsius (or higher) for around two minutes. 

We've tried and tested a few reactions that we were able to dig up, the most promising of which was a reaction between ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite. That one got us the heat we needed and had safe products (NaCl and N2 gas) but the problem is we had to catalyze it with an inorganic acid, and the amount of HCl we ending up needing just isn't safe to be heated to those temperatures.

So I thought I'd ask if anyone on this subreddit has any suggestions for a safer reaction that produces a decent amount of heat? Or if anyone knows a way of catalyzing the NH4Cl + NaNO3 reaction with something that isn't so nasty when heated that would be great."

Who here has experience with JEOL NMRs?,8,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1508859306,True,"I recently moved from a small CRO that had a nice Bruker to a large, global company who has an aging Varian/Agilent system.

My dilemma: I cannot find anyone with experience on a JEOL system. I'm curious to know how running compares to Bruker and/or Varian/Agilent systems as well as data reprocessing. I quite liked Bruker and Topspin at my last job and hated our Varians in grad school and still hate our current Varian/Agilent but JEOL seems like an unknown quantity. With the price being quite a bit cheaper for a 500, I'm wondering if it's still worth considering. JEOL also offers a free site-wide license and telephone support for the life of the instrument as well as a much longer warranty, which is a nice feature.

Question: Heating liquid with Sulfur Dioxide...,1,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1508939473,True,"Hoping this is not inappropriate for this sub-reddit...

Question: If sulfur dioxide is used as an additive in liquids (specifically coconut milk or coconut cream in this case), will cooking it help remove it? If so, how long should I cook it for? 

I tried googling it but only came up with some studies that dealt with foods that were not liquid (squash, hamburgers). 

I just bought a case full of coconut milk that is labeled as ""100%"" coconut milk BUT apparently in the EU it is labeled with E220 which is Sulfur Dioxide (I guess the FDA did not require this labeling here...). 

I found this dude asking about Sulfur Dioxide a few years back, but it was specific to dried fruit and doesn't really help....

And yes, I know it's ""mostly harmless"" but it CAN cause issues in people with asthma (not me) or intestinal sensitivities (me).... And I'm only asking because I already bought the damn milk. :(

Position #1: DuPont
-Good pay and benefits (I like)
-Morale at an all time low (Dont Like)
-Working conditions are terrible (Dont Like)
-Equipment is outdated (Dont Like)
-So much restructuring of the company that its insane (Dont Like)
-The job concerns synthetic organic chemistry (Not really what i'm into)



Position #2: Eurofins (CRO) at a big pharma client
-Higher pay (but hourly) with lower quality benefits (Im ok with)
-Morale is high at both the CRO and client company (I like)
-Working conditions are much much nicer (I like)
-Equipment is new and I have the opportunity to learn many new ones (I like)
-The job is more process chemistry and QC (Thoughts?)
-My offer letter says the client can terminate the position at anytime without notice or cause (Really don't like, but the guy I am replacing had been there for ~3 years)

My career path is not to stay in the lab for very long. In 2 years I would like to get my MBA and move onto a more managerial style position and slowly edge my way to the business development aspect of pharma.

It isn't at all fleshed out yet. Basically it's a game where you use the periodic system, to 'craft' other substances. With that you can then again build other substances. Then you'll learn where it's used for, what it is, etc.

My chemistry knowledge is quite limited. So a lot of research will still have to be done. But my most important question is: would it be realistic?

What are some simple combinations that can make up bigger substances each time? Like eventually you can create glass, though starting at the periodic level.

Some games that inspired me were 

https://littlealchemy2.com/

https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust2/

(Though, these games lack the educational element)

**Edit:**

Fleshed it out a bit more. The first stage would be a discovery stage. Maybe in a way like Minecraft and Terarria does. You search through the world for substances and learn about them. So mainly collecting at this stage.

Then the 'crafting' stage. Here it's education that counts. You must create new substances with what you found and the machines available. Since I've seen in the comments it isn't just A + B, Maybe I can add some Math instead. 

The reward for actually doing those formulas is that you can now 'create' stuff. This is more a fun part again. You could either blow things up (Think of powder game), or really create something nice. 

The name would be; Madscientist - The world where knowledge is power. Since the only ones actually being able to create a lot of cool stuff, would be the ones with the highest knowledge of Chemistry."

The Periodic Law,46,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1509294175,True,"Hello,

My name is Justin Colburn and I have some concerns about the Standard Periodic Table of Elements that are often not addressed. The Periodic Table of Elements has become an icon of science as one of the greatest comprehensive discoveries of mankind. But is it accurate? The greatest deceptions contain Elements of Truth!

As you know, the Periodic Table of Elements is actually based on The Periodic Law, which was discovered in 1867 by a Russian Scientist named Dimitri Mendeleev. The Periodic Law has been used to accurately predict new Elements and remains a foundational LAW and a staple in Chemistry.

Unfortunately the LAW has been misrepresented in a broken system. 30 Rare Earth Elements are commonly placed out of order and omitted from the nomenclature for no better reason than ""Neatness"". In the age of widescreen smart phones and monitors, ""saving paper space"" is a poor reason to break logic and butcher The Periodic Law. 

There is a more accurate numbering system that can be used which reflects the True quantitative nature of our Universe. Every time the Standard Periodic Table is used people are likely missing the bigger picture. The Periodic Law is a fundamental Truth that should not be arbitrarily changed. 

Again, there is a bigger picture that is being missed concerning the nature of our Universe! The order of the Atoms are of great importance and will become more relevant as Anti-Matter creates a mirror reflection. I will go into much more detail in future posts about how we can improve the Periodic system and accurately reflect The Periodic Law in a way that provides a timeline of the Elemental creation of our Universe. 

I have been developing a flip-book style system for the last several years that I believe is going to prove a more effective and more accurate way to learn crucial information about the Elements and The Periodic Law.

This is my first post on here and I appreciate you all taking the time to read this. I would love to get some feedback about this topic and if you would be open to a revised Periodic System with a more accurate nomenclature? 

Thanks for your time! 
God bless

Was wondering if any of you had any experience in Retention Time Locking. I Currently use an Agilent 7890A-Dual Gc-FID along with Agilent Openlab Control Panel (Product version: A.01.09.126). I've followed the software's internal instructions for retention time locking. Found the retention times for my desired compounds at the 5 different pressures and produced an RTL calibration file and yet when I go to rerun the same sample with the supposedly locked method, the retention time of my compound varies quite a bit from the desired retention time.

Have any of you lot successfully locked a compound on this system/software? How did you do it? Where might I be going wrong. I cant seem to find anything online for this particular software."

Now it's blue. Now it isn't. Aaaand it's blue again.,2,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1509401583,True,"Ok, so this is a process based on thin films. Can't specify the hows and whys due to a NDA.

The sample starts with a glass substrate on which aluminium is deposited. On top of this aluminium, an alloy (CoCrPt) is deposited and defined through ion milling (argon ions). All dandy so far, except the sample comes out with a yellow-brownish colour.
The aluminium is to be removed through a chemical bath. Which is slowly successful.
Since this part needs to be monitored, the bath only lasts some seconds on each run. To stop the reaction, the sample is submerged in water.

And it turns blue.

I remove it from the water, rinse with isopropyl alcohol and let dry. As soon as it dries, it reverts to a darker shade of the yellow-brownish colour. More to the brown side after each bath.

My guess is that the yellow-brownish colour is a cobalt oxide. My guess for the blue colour is that it's actually cobalt aluminate (cobalt blue pigment).
Why both things happen are mysteries to me.

DIY carbon fiber?,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1509481678,True," You can find many videos on the net of people using carbon fiber to form their own lightweight boat, car, bike, parts etc.

 But I'm asking something more basic than that. I want to make the carbon fiber *itself*. The reason is for an aerospace project I'm involved in that needs carbon fiber for its lightweight. But carbon fiber is expensive in the range of $20 per kilo. Compare this to the cost of aluminum alloy in the range of $2.50 per kilo.

 The precursor material for making the carbon fiber is polyacrylonitrile (PAN). This costs in the range of $2 per kilo when purchased in large bulk sizes.

 Here are some references for the production of carbon fiber from PAN:

Sources of Error in Cyclic Voltammetry. Underpotential deposition?,11,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1509523709,True,"Hey Everyone!

Some background: I synthesize and characterize (potential) electrolytes for batteries in my lab. For the past year I have been synthesizing electrolytes, taking painstaking steps to make sure they are pure, then putting it all to the test in a 3 electrode cell to test their reversibility. (Cell is metal counter electrode, platinum working electrode, metal reference electrode).

Here's where my troubles come in. Recently a tried and true electrolyte we make in house that has been published, and continues to be studied by the electrochemistry community extensively has stopped displaying reversibility in our cyclic voltammograms. We observe deposition (reduction) of metal via a current response, but rarely stripping (oxidation). This has become a major problem not only because the electrolyte we make is expensive and synthetically challenging, but now i am doubting whether my past novel electrolyte failures, which display deposition currents but no stripping currents, may actually work. 

I started suspecting something may be very wrong just recently when observing current response relative to the metal at ""underpotentials"" in some new materials I have been testing, that is positive voltages before you would expect the electrolyte to be reduced. These can be seen up to almost a volt before I would expect reduction of the electrolyte. Of course, I observe no stripping current responses in one of the materials I observed the underpotential in. In another material, I observe reversible oxidation through multiple cycles, but at very positive voltages (+2.0V) and with very little current response.

Is anyone familiar enough with CV to have observed false underpotentials and determined the cause? Could there be some other experimental error I'm missing? apparently underpotential deposition is a thing, but not typically at the voltages I am observing.

for reference, these are the steps I have taken to decrease error in my CV.

1) recrystallized my electrolyte material multiple times before testing + examined HNMR for any obvious impurity

2) examined my electrolyte solvents for water content (&lt;3.0 ppm) and impurities (also by HNMR)

3) examined purity of starting materials prior to forming product

4) attempted a synthesis of the ""tried and true"" material multiple times (going on 5 or 6 now) with only 1 success.

Theory: I have been testing some of the new materials I make at somewhat low concentrations (0.15M) and the volume of solvent hasnt been been very high either. Its a challenge to submerge the counter electrode into the electrolyte solution fully sometimes. perhaps I need to make more concentrated, larger volume solutions to test in order to avoid this?

If anyone has any insight into this problem or can at the very least help me escape tunnel vision I thank you dearly in advance for your help. This has grown into a major headache for me.

I have a few grams (4~5g) of steel powder from grinding down steel scraps, and I have a small amount of aluminum powder. They are about the same weight. 
So, my question is, is it possible to separate the iron from steel? I know that steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, but I am not sure if it's possible to separate them without melting them to liquid, but using conventional chemical reactions. 
I should've probably asked before I did this, but I currently have the steel powder sitting a solution of 30% H2O2. I put about ~30ml with it. Is there any way to separate iron from carbon?"

Wow its already November! Welcome back everyone to Week 42 of Synthetic Challenge!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

With the current implementation of the two molecule challenges, the synthetic products will be labelled with A or B and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference if it is a novel technique. You do not have to solve synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or is too complex to explain in words.

Element,7,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1509625866,True,"note (Im 14 and English isn't my main language, so my context may not be the best, neither my knowledge in this field)

I recently made a short presentation on the periodic table, its concept, the structure of it and its history. I also researched the structure of elements and their individual characteristics. It was very interesting and i also learned allot, but due too the short amount of time i had (1 week) and my low chemistry knowledge, it wasn't easy to study, especially cause Wikipedia usually build on concepts which are meant to define a specific field at its maximum potential, and isn't really helpful for people who can't want to learn this concept, but can't comprehend the concept yet, this isn't only an issue that Wikipedia especially has, but most sites start from a certain (excepted point of knowledge, concept comprehension), and their information, isn't guaranteed to be accurate (correct). 

Anyways back to what this was referring to, i googled ""is it possible to transform an element in another one"" some sources like quora said it was possible, but is it also possible to transform an actual chunk of an element (iron for example) into another element (copper for example)?"

I already have anxiety (diagnosed, constantly pervasive), but I dread OChem lab because no matter how much I prepare, the second it starts my anxiety shoots through the roof and it makes things even worse because I make dumb mistakes. 

My grade is fine, an A, even if my yields vary (in fact, between very good, high yields, and bad to none due to having screwed up numbers or accidentally spilling things). But I make a fool out of myself. My TA rolls their eyes when I ask questions because I ask so many, and again, I've cried way too much in this lab. What's going on? I should be good at this! Great, even! But everyone thinks I'm incapable of anything (including myself :( ) because of the mistakes I make under pressure. 

So I ask myself ""How will I ever be a chemist?"" but the thing is... I have. I had a successful analytical chem internship (analytical is my prospective field, *not* ochem/synthesis), did an IS project, am still doing independent research, and have been fine in all my other labs. Synthesis inherently makes me anxious. The thing that bothers me is the weighing errors, which I should *definitely* not make as an analytical (prospective) chemist. But I do. And I freak out. 

So what do I do? Is this it for me? I've tried getting a handle of my anxiety, including meds, and nothing has worked. Labs are just stressful. I don't care about the rest of my life, how can I manage labs *alone* so I can stop making a fool of myself (again, my grade is fine)? It's getting to be pathetic. "

You see in my country college degrees are just pieces of paper. Like yeah sure they get you better jobs and better paychecks but the thing is everyone can get them. They're not really a measure of your knowledge, if you apply for college there's a 99% chance you're going to get that degree. The coursework, the tests and exams and even the professors are not really challenging or doing their jobs well. And if let's say for example i wanted to go study or work abraod I'd find myself so embarassingly and pathetically behind.


I love chemistry, and i really do want to do something with my life that involves it. I try to find online resources to help me better myself at it but theres so much to learn and i never know where to start so i quit way too quickly. (Consequence of being the product of a messed up unchallenging educational system). The fact that I'm really interested in and good at understanding the theory behind it but very bad at memorising that information doesn't really help with my self-esteem issues.

I just get so worked up over the fact that i should be able by now to call myself a chemist, to talk and think like one, to be vastly knowledgeable in the field, or at least in my branch, but i don't and I'm not.

Absolutely hate the lab portion of my chemistry classes.,14,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1509660925,True,"So I am in my third year of university and have just come to hate my chemistry labs. I am a chemistry and math dual major and I have found myself just wanting to do research with my math professor rather than working with any chemistry professors because I don't find enjoyment in doing any lab work. I get anxious about messing things up in lab or breaking some expensive glassware and I don't even find enjoyment in learning about the different machines and what they do. I much rather enjoy lecture and just like learning about the theory and the math and reaction mechanisms than actually doing the labs. Are there any jobs out there for chemistry that don't require you to be in lab or will I be miserable working in a lab my whole life. I already took organic and loved  the theory portion of it so it seems stupid to give up on the Chem major as a whole.

Blackening titanium- can somebody explain what happens?,6,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1509673513,True,"I tried asking this over on an engineering sub,  then someone suggested I ask here, so here goes.
I've discovered it's possible to turn titanium a very dark grey/black by heating (1400-1700 degrees F estimated) and quenching in oil multiple times. The resulting black seems to be some sort of oxide that forms, it's quite tough and holds up to abrasion surprisingly well. I don't think it's just a carbon layer.

Can anyone explain (or offer a theory) what is happening during the process, or what the black layer is?


One possible answer was suggested, maybe someone can confirm? 

""I like the idea of carbon being present, but I think it might actually be doing chemistry with the titanium oxide. When you heat up the Ti initially it forms a transparent TiO2 oxide film. Then, the carbon from the oil possibly reduces the TiO2 to a suboxide phase (Ti4O7 or the like), which is black. On repetition you probably are building up more of the reduced oxide.

You could measure the surface conductivity of bare Ti, heated Ti, and oil-quenched Ti. TiO2 should not be conductive but the suboxide is. A test you could do is heat the oil-quenched sample for a while in air and see if the color/conductivity switches (oxidizing atmosphere).""

But true vanilla extract is really expensive in my country, and I'm kinda a keto/paleo guy, so I don't want that filthy vanillin thing. Oh, but apparently Pandanus is the new hot thing in hippie foody culture, and its taste and aroma is very comparable to vanilla, so what if I make the extract myself! It's native to my country, so I can get the fresh Pandan leaves very easily from the farmer's market.

But what solvent to use? I'm aware that the cottage herbal extract industry in the west normally use ethanol-water mixture, but this is a muslim country, and there's some difficulty in getting a bottle of vodka, not to mention the hefty tax on it and the social reception to my hypothetical vodka-laced cheesecake.

So I reviewed the alternative solvents that I could use. Glycerol is an option. It's non-toxic, has good taste, I can synthesize it myself from oil and lye if the supermarket don't have it, but supposedly it's not as good as an extractor as ethanol-water. I'm gonna try it out, see what happens.

The other option is acetone. Very good solvent, awful smell, mostly tasteless, I can synthesize it from calcium acetate (buy, or make from eggshells and vinegar), but the toxicity is uncertain.

Hazard.com: ""generally recognized to have low acute and chronic toxicity if ingested and/or inhaled""

EPA classifies it as ""Generally Regarded as Safe"" ""at concentrations ranging from 5 to 8 mg/L""

Various other forums about herbal extractions (mostly weedheads) warn against it, citing ""liver toxicity""

Toxipedia: ""In no circumstance should it be consumed directly or indirectly"". It also lists some scary effects of prolonged exposure to acetone, including reproductive issues.

"Is there any way of visualising the tabulated results of DFT geometry optimisation calculations, as they are published in SI?",7,4,False,False,False,chemistry,1509754841,True,"So I'm reading [this paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b07388) on the total synthesis of Pavidolide B (which is very good, by the way), in which the authors describe some DFT calculations they have performed to explain the selectivity of a key radical cascade step in their synth. I'm just wondering if there is any way of visualising the results of their geometry optimisation calculations as they are published in the SI?

When functional group present:

Alcohol R-OH:
Number from end closest to OH

Aldehydes and Ketones R-COH &amp; R-CO-R:
Number from Carbonyl Group unless COOH present

Carboxylic acid:
Highest prioritization and count from the C in this functional group

Ester: 
C of Ester is C number 1 in the chain
Begin name with alkyl group attached to O

Amine:
Begin name with alkyl group attached to N

Ether:
Begin name with alkyl group attached to O

Functional Group Prioritization when there's multiple of them:
Carboxylic Acid,
Ester,
Amine,
Aldehyde,
Ketone,
Alcohol,
Amines

Wondering about solvent effects on reagent boiling,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1509935244,True,"Typically, one reaction I run has one of my reagents boiling quite vigorously, and quite a bit of my reagent is dripping back down into my reaction from a condenser.

 This puzzled me since it is the exact same reaction vessel and condenser, and since this was a larger reaction size, I expected more boiling.

Online I saw papers that said cypermethrin is hydrophobic, but ""likes"" to attach to flocculants or whatever, small particles, in water, so you can get it out that way.  Will the rubbing alcohol get most of it off the interior surface of the jug?

I'm not terribly worried about this, but I figure it would be good to try to clean the jug out.  If the rubbing alcohol won't clean it, what should I do?

Looking at the requirements, it would be nearly impossible to double major in chemistry and physics/computer science at this point. However, I only need ~30 more credits for a math major.

Osmosis: Why it happens,1,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1510083791,True,"Osmosis is not only often misunderstood; many don't try to understand it at all. Here's a simple description of the exact mechanics.

(Quick jargon repetition: solution = solute solved in solvent. Solvent passes through semipermeable membrane, solute doesn't.)

The important thing to notice is, there's not just gradient equalling happening. There's actual momentum produced, capable of overcoming other forces.

This momentum is translated from the movement of the particles in each solution, not caused by some external force on the solution.

Remember: one solution moves freely. The other bounces off a surface, causing movement in the opposite direction.

The momentum ""into"" each side is equal to the reflection momentum of the particles of solute that hit the membrane. It is proportional to kinetic energy in solution.

The concentration gradient equalling is a secondary effect of this momentum. Solvent particles move along the pressure gradient caused by reflection momentum.

Calling osmosis a special case of diffusion, is wrong. Diffusion does not generate pressure."

Capabilities of a Mass Spectrometer,7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1510148158,True,"I work for a detergent and sanitizer manufacturing company.

Specifically this product is a detergent that is composed of 6 compounds.  At this point we are not certain if a chemical was left out, if a chemical that wasn't supposed to be used was used, or if a chemical was added with an incorrect amount.

How likely is it that using a mass spectrometer on a mixture of 5-6 chemicals would have been able to determine that the product was bad prior to approval?

"I'm feeling overwhelmed and intimidated by my organometallic undergraduate research, is this normal? Also I feel clueless on inorganic chemistry, any advice?",23,32,False,False,False,chemistry,1510164453,True,"A little background: I am in my junior year of college working towards my BS in chemistry and hopefully moving on to grad school. I've taken two organic chemistry classes, one organic lab class (the higher lab class for chemistry majors vs the normal orgo lab class for non chemistry majors). I've taken one inorganic chemistry class and am currently in a class called advanced inorganic. I am also currently taking an inorganic lab class. I've also taken my general chemistry classes, analytical, and physical chemsitry, but I don't think those are quite relevant here.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, this semester I've started my first semester of undergraduate research. I'm working on a project about synthesizing organic reductants for early transition metals, followed by reducing said metals. I've been talking with my professor since about April about working with him, and he has given me plenty to read since then. My problem is I don't have a fucking clue what I'm doing. I've read SO many papers from journals, and they're so dense its almost like I haven't read them. Or if I do understand it (which is happening more and more, practice makes perfect) I don't know how to apply it to my project.

&amp;nbsp;

I think a lot of my problem is I don't get inorganic chemistry like I get organic. Organic chemistry is my favorite. That's why I decided to work on this project, it involves organic synthesis. Now that doesn't mean I don't like inorganic. I think its interesting and I want to understand it. I just don't. I figured I could learn inorganic on the fly since I understood organic so easily. Turns out I was wrong. Like I said I've already taken one inorganic class, and am currently in another inorganic lecture and lab class. But I still have yet to have it click. I understand a lot of the subjects brought up in these classes. I understand the gist of molecular orbital theory and symmetry/group theory applied to chemistry, but I don't fully get it. Like I can't look at a molecule and sketch a molecular orbital theory diagram. I don't know if that's super important to understand inorganic but I feel like it is. I get trends of the periodic table. I understand the splitting energy idea from crystal field theory, along with the high spin low spin complexes. I understand counting electrons. I just can't understand inorganic like I understand organic. In organic carbon behaves in specific ways (usually), functional groups can make a carbon electrophilic/nucleophilic, and so on and so on. I understand the mechanisms and can predict how reactions work. Once a transition metal is thrown into the mix, it's like it all falls apart. I don't understand how organic molecules react with transition metals. I don't get how inorganic molecules react with transition metals. I just don't get how transition metals react. This is a problem since my research involves transition metals. I don't really understand my reactions. I'm just following the procedure more or less blindly, and I hate that. I want to understand what's happening. What should I read/do/try to learn to understand inorganic better?

&amp;nbsp;

Because I don't understand inorganic chemistry, I don't understand the literature I'm assigned to find and read, and I don't understand the reactions I'm doing. This makes me feel really overwhelmed and intimidated, like I'm the dumbest one in the lab holding everyone back. This also scares me because I want to go into grad school and keep doing research. I worry that if I can't handle this how will I handle grad school? Is this a normal feeling for undergraduates in research? How do I work towards overcoming it?"

Things to consider if you are in or are planning on going to graduate school,4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1510168336,False, 
"Feeling lost, need advice on what to do next.",9,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1510171296,True,"   I am a sophomore undergrad reading chemistry at the moment and I am starting to doubt if I should go on.

  My original purpose was to be a researcher. I've always been into science and with chemistry it seemed as though I could fulfill my potential. I knew it would be hard, but I believed I could overcome any difficulties by staying passionate and motivated.

   I am definitely talented: I aced all of my freshman exams and during the last year I managed to greatly improve my lab technique and eventually became comfortable with handling lab equipment.

   However, I've started to doubt that I could be a researcher for life. I only had limited exposure so far to actual chemical research, but I already have mixed  feelings about it. More precisely, I hate working with (potentially) toxic , dangerous solvents/reagents/products and dislike the trial-and-error approach (for example,  changing proportions of reagents or ligands to synthesise a complex). I find satisfaction in a  successful synthesis and in visualising things like crystals/ cells on a microscope), but It's the end result  I am more interested in and not the reagent handling/ pipetting/ filtering/ heating  required to get there. Also, while the main advantage of academic research seems to be freedom, it requires you to know exactly what you need to do/ what specific topic to choose and be certain it would not fail. Yet I feel disoriented about picking a certain topic. 

   I used to be keen on becoming a synthetic chemist, but in my country ( and  apparently elsewhere) this is only possible in academia and requires a PhD, which is not worth spending 5 years in  if I don't absolutely love research . That lead me to consider working in the  industry before jumping into grad school. 

   The problem is that most jobs in the industry  seem to be analytical. I actually like analytical chem, but everyone says it becomes mundane eventually and is poorly paid. 

  If I could choose, I would like to work in drug design/ formulation as a med chemist. I'm also considering biochemistry, but I don't know if it would be relevant in the industry.

   The reason why I prefer industry over academia is better pay, more career options, safer environment and having a more defined research goal.

   I have narrowed it down to two options: either finish my BSc and a relevant MSc or go to  Pharmacy School and finish my BSc later.The latter would open up the pharmacological  part of drug design, not just the chemistry.

   Tl; dr: Which is the best career path for a career in  industry over academia,  ? Is a chem Bsc + Msc worth it or is a PharmD or something else a safer bet?

Graduate School Personal Statement,4,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1510191033,True,"Hi,

I've been working on my personal statement for applying to graduate schools. I've had two people whom I trust (and have earned their PhDs) look at it and offer me advice.  
One of them said it was good, and to add more detail to the research I did in my undergraduate research and also my internship.   


The other person, however, said that ""I gave a lot of details of what you did in your research, but it's not supposed to be a scientific report, it is a *personal statement*"".  
And she thinks I should emphasize instead what the research taught me as a person (not as a scientist). 

I think the best, and most obvious thing to do, is to do both. Be succinct in what I accomplished, but also what it taught me as a person. 
Another thing, though, is that one of the reviewers said:
&gt;  ""If KU specifically requested that you tell them who you are willing to work for and why, then great keep all of paragraph 4.  But if they asked you to talk about yourself, then only mention those professors who intrigue you because you feel they are in line with their passion.  Don’t summarize their research.  The department knows what they do and what the applications are.  It is enough for you to say that you think it is cool.""

The thing is, KU didn't really give a prompt for the personal statement... they really just give you a link that says ""personal statement: upload"" (highly recommended but not required). 

Is it better to talk more about myself entirely... or should I also talk about my interest in the school and their researchers? 

Thanks for any and all help. 

Additionally (long shot here), if anyone would be willing to take a look at my personal statement, I would be more than appreciative to send it to you for comments.

My goal is to distinguish differences in the planar and non planar conformations of my compound of interest. When I initially ran the calculation, the log output file gave me the compound with a 22 degree dihedral angle. From there I obtained the HOMO-LUMO orbitals as well as their corresponding energy values. Now I need to obtain these values for the planar conformation. Are there any experienced computational chemists who could assist me? It would be greatly appreciated!"

"SOPs versus Integrated Work Documents (IWDs). A quick google makes me feel they are very similar, but not quite. Advice?",4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1510334347,True,"SOPs (or Standard Operating Procedures) are listed in many jobs for chemists. [IWDs](https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/06/f23/P300%20Integrated%20Work%20Management%2001.22.2014.pdf) (or Integrated Work Documents) are the documents used at National Laboratories (specifically LANL, is what I'm familiar with). 

If I have experience with one, how much experience can I justify with the other categorically? [Here](https://ehs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/lines-of-services/workplace-safety/46labspecificsops.pdf) is an SOP info doc from Berkeley. To me they both seem to aim to provide a set of *rules* that designate the work being done, its hazards, and the precautions that should be taken. 

At LANL, if you worked with a dangerous chemical, you had to have it on the IWD, and if you didn't a new one would have to be written to justify its use. This also went along to say that it also required basic *On The Job Training* or courses to not only relieve the lab to some extent from being indemnified, but also to prevent workplace injuries (I could be wrong and please correct me if I am, but I think this paraphrases it well).

To what level do we have experience with SOPs if we have experience with things like IWDs or say just a ACS certified degree? How about GLP experience. Obviously we wont know the exact regulations, but to what extent is a Post-undergrad capable? I know these are subjective, but jobs are scarce and justifying an application to a job is sometimes obfuscated, but that doesn't mean we aren't qualified? Maybe we didn't pay attention to jargon on the review before the quiz. Any way, I hope this inspires some good discussion and some genuinely pragmatic answers"

I am involved in the tea enthusiast community where there are many - many - myths and anecdotal stories going around. Some of these regards to water. We've also seen these things repeated in the mainstream media on a regular basis.
The most common idea is that you should never boil the same water more than once. The reasons given can be categorized in three groups: 1) obvious superstition, 2) dissolved oxygen and 3) other things. I am asking for help with 2 and 3. Here are my specific questions:  


**Is the amount of dissolved oxygen in water reduced further by boiling the water multiple times, i.e. is it lower if boiled twice than after being boiled once?**  

**Can you think of any other effect on boiling water multiple times that might affect the taste of the water? Minerals or sodium being concentrated? Anything else?**

So I ask, how safe are Silver Nitrate sticks?? whether I apply it to the canker sore on my tongue or even lip? Is this safe? Am I going to turn blue indefinitely??

There are four ingredients. The first is water. The second is phosphorescent powder which I'm fairly certain is copper-doped zinc sulfide.

The third ingredient is thickener which I think might be guar gum. It's a fine, off-white powder, with a slight grain or bean smell.

The fourth ingredient I'm not so sure about. The company just calls it crosslinker. It's a clear, colorless liquid, slightly more viscous than water, that has a slippery feeling and a slight citrus smell. I don't know if that's its natural smell or an added fragrance. My only guess is that it might be sodium tetraborate solution.

The slime that is produced is a translucent light yellowish color.

Question regarding using Ka and finding percent ionization,2,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1510518327,True,"When it comes to trying to find the concentration of H+ and pH from Ka, I understand that you have to use a table and whatnot to get to an equation that generally looks like (x)(x)/(acid concentration - x) = Ka and you can end up ignoring the ""- x"" part because you can make an assumption that x is much smaller than the acid concentration. if at the end the percent ionization (H+/acid concentration * 100%) is less than 5% doing this is okay, otherwise you need to go back and do the quadratic formula from the equation to get the right H+ concentration. 

What confuses me is that I've only seen this used with weak acids. if the acid mentioned is a strong acid like HCl, would i be obligated to do the quadratic formula in the first place since all strong acids ionize 100% in water? Or is the first method still okay? Is there a percent ionization rule i should know for strong acids?"

How do I not kill myself from mystery herbal supplements?,6,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1510717278,True,"Hi everyone, 

First of all, I apologize in advance for how naive and dumb this may sound. Biology/chemistry is not really my wheelhouse and I haven't done anything related since high school. I used to take this herbal medicine called rutaecarpine and it really helped me metabolize caffeine. It helped me sleep; noticeably after drinking too much coffee.

Why does a strong dipole moment result in a high bond disassociation energy?,11,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1510722106,True,"My question relates to the carbon-fluorine bond having a high dipole moment due to the electro negativity between fluorine and carbon. I looked it up, and C-F BDE is greater than a C-C bond, meaning there is more energy in the bond, right? Meaning the molecule is more stable.

What about this bond makes it so stable? I know, it's the ""polarity"", but what about that makes it so strong? I guess a positive gets to be next to a negative?

Another question: Hydrogen and Fluorine also form a very strong bond, apparently the second most strong single bond in organic chemistry. And generally, strong bonds result in little reactivity. So, why is HF an acid? If the bond is so strong, why would Fluorine be used as a reagent to donate protons?

Thanks.

Is it worth doing a double major in biochemistry if Im a biology major with a chem minor?,4,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1510785848,True,"Im currently working on a degree with a biology major and a chemistry minor.  I was considering changing that minor to a major in biochemistry as it would only require an additional 22 credits.  The unfortunate thing is  8 of those credits are from calculus 2 and 3, and I would be required to do university physics (200 level)  instead of general physics (100 level).

A major in chemistry would require approximately 36 additional credits, and would encompass the classes required for biochemistry due to elective requirements.

The additional chemistry classes to do a major in biochem would only be intermediate biochemistry, biochemistry lab, and two physical chemistry lectures.  Plus a seminar.

A double major in chemistry wouldn't be feasible simply due to time constraints, but I could manage biochemistry. I would have to restructure my course selections now in order to finish on time.  

Im wondering if it is worthwhile given it doesnt seem to require too many additional chemistry-centric courses.

The goals I have in mind are able to be met with a biology degree, but I do like to keep my options open and feel that saying I completed a biochemistry BSc would look better.

"Question about acids/bases and ph: does equivalent ph mean equivalent ""danger""?",4,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1510789077,True,"Alright so, taking chem 2 now and weve been learning about acids and bases and all that, mighty interesting, but im having trouble finding an answer to this one question: if two solutions have the same ph, even if they have like different acids in them just in different concentrations, will they have the same ""danger"" or ""damage"" level? Probably a better word for that, but. whenever I try looking it up I just find health articles about ""your body's ph levels"". 

Im assuming its a lil more complicated than that, but to simplify it: I already understand that ph level is a measure of the concentration of H+ and all that, does it directly correlate to how much damage it can do? 

Just considering the acidity, if you diluted a strong acid to the level of say, some type of soda, would it do just as much damage as the soda to drink it? or would it be worse?

And of course does what the actual acid/base is effect it? Like, same ph, but because this ones orange juice and this ones (insert same ph acid here), so you'll die if you drink that. I'm assuming the answer is yes, but would that just be how the components affect you or (like x acid contains poisonous to humans chemical) or what?

Sorry if this is worded weirdly i just got curious and i was wondering how much ph tells you danger levels n stuff"

HP/Agilent 5890 TCD solenoid valve,1,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1510934177,True,"Hello there,

I am currently rebuilding an HP 5890 Series II GC. The GC originally had an ECD, which I am replacing with a TCD from GOW-MAC. Most of it has gone fairly smoothly, except that when I started the TCD, I couldn't get a signal. However, the FID (which is in series with the TCD) recorded peaks.

Apparently, how the TCD works is it uses a solenoid valve, which switches between column+makeup gas and reference gas ~5 times per second. 

My question is: how exactly does the TCD circuit board send signals to the solenoid valve? I'm getting a 12V and a 24V DC signal off the board, but when I attach a solenoid valve I had lying around, it opens and stays open. Should there be a square wave (i.e. 0V-24V-0V) at a frequency of 5Hz firing the valve?

"" will not stand on equal footing and you will need to provide solid lab evidence or credible sources to support you're claim and if not you will be called out. Thank-you 

Also as a note please I am posting this topic as a curious question, please do not attack me personally for my claims I'm not an expert nor posses a degree of any sort but I do consider myself pretty well rounded when it comes to the sciences and judging reason from just people's personal fancies, factual evidence and exsperience from just trolling or pretentious false knowledge.

I am interested in this topic because from either points of view weather it be supports of this theory to the Deniers of it there is no factual evidence by either side presente that I have not found. 

It's like there is the crazy supporters of Atlantis, alchemy, Aliens and energy channelers to just the outwrite beligerant deniers who don't give any credible eveidance but just talk crap without eveidance.

However again please people don't take things so seriously let's just have a rational discussion. 

Personally I feel I am a little knowledgable in this area of the physics of atoms, however I am normal sure about the physics of gold and if it could be dissolved to either a monoatomic or diatomic state and be mix in salts to provide any real healing. 

I don't believe the claims around this theoretical substance nor do I believe in alchemy,  transmutation, ect.  I am a open-mindedness skeptic in this.

Buchwald-Hartwig Amination Solvent Choice,4,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1510986228,True,"Hi guys!

I've recently been working with buchwald-hartwig aminations and have been wondering about the scope of solvent choice that this reaction is able to tolerate. I've mostly only seen toluene, but it seems like 1,4 dioxane is also a suitable choice.  However, for the system I am working with, my amine is very polar, and not soluble in non-polar organic solvents like toluene, and is only soluble in more polar solvents, such as DMF.  I've attempted this reaction with no luck so far, and thought that the poor solubility could be part of the reason why the reaction yield sucked. 
I've found a publication where there are a couple examples of DMF being used as a solvent, with Cs2CO3 as a base, (Angew. Chem. Int . Ed. 2006, 45, 6523 –6527, doi: 10.1002/anie.200601612) but this seems to be one of the few examples that uses DMF as a solvent for B-H aminations. Is there any reason DMF, and other solvents havent been explored more in the literature? Is it best to use toluene despite the crappy solubility?

Thanks

Does OsO4 under Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation conditions prefer to oxidise conjugated or non-conjugated olefins?,8,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1511010042,True,"I'm working on designing a synthesis for discodermolide, and one question that popped up is whether you can selectively oxidise a non-conjugated olefin in the presence of a more conjugated one. There are some parallels to say the mCPBA epoxidation of olefins (which favours the non-conjugated olefin, all else being similar), but I'm not sure if the parallel extends to Sharpless AD.

The molecule to be subjected to dihydroxylation is [this](https://imgur.com/a/iEbnk). It seems like, crudely speaking, the preference for dihydroxylation is roughly trisubstituted &gt; trans disubstituted &gt; terminal &gt; cis disubstituted, so oxidation of the internal cis alkene seems unlikely, but now the issue is chemoselectivity between the two terminal alkenes, one conjugated and one not. It's not really a huge issue - I can simply protect the aldehyde instead of directly converting it into the cis diene, but just curious if such a differentiation would be possible. 

Does anyone have any experience with similar molecules or have read any papers dealing with this? It shouldn't be that difficult to find precedent, but I've been googling for 2 hours without learning much. I've read the [1994 review](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr00032a009) from the Sharpless group, which is incredibly comprehensive, but it doesn't really address my question. "

Origin as a point on a calibration curve?,10,9,False,False,False,chemistry,1511058804,True,"I have been having a disagreement with my colleagues.

One dial is used to set transmittance to 0% when the light is blocked by a spring-loaded beam stop.  Another dial is used to set the transmittance to 100% when a blank is used (e.g. deionized water in a cuvette).  

So with this procedure, is it proper to include (0,0) as a point on a calibration curve?  I say it isn't, since that zero was used to define the calibration.  My colleagues disagree, although they do say that the point should be given the same weight as any other data element and we should not force the calibration curve through zero.  Would it make any difference, if we took the blank out and then popped it back in to ""measure"" the zero after setting the calibration?  (I think that's cheating, but asking to be sure.)

WTF is MRET Activated Water? Please explain in layman's terms HOW this can be a scam,8,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1511108967,True,"Hello Chemistry world,

I have a friend who believes and has heavily bought into this MRET (Molecular Resonance Effect Technology) Activated Water. They purchased some device that looks like a Brita Water Filter, and claims to use this technology. You fill it with water, plug it in, and then it uses ""MRET"" to ""activate"" your water. It also makes absolutely no noise, so you just sort of assume it's doing its thing. 

One paper writes: ""It was discovered in detailed experiments that under the action of this activator there are very essential modifications of the basic physical-molecular properties of distilled water (decrease of viscosities, electrical conductivity and permittivity by several times, sharp increasing or oscillation of pH exponent etc.)."" Most if not all of these papers are written by a Dr. Igor Smirnov, and a few others, which leads me to believe there is a heavy experimenter effect.

There are numerous claims online of it curing cancer, diabetes, joint issues etc. To me this seems bogus, but as a scientist I would like to know why, scientifically speaking, it may be bogus. It sort of reminds me of Masaru Emoto and others claiming water has memory and that ""intention setting"" can effect it.

[QUESTION] Half-chair conformation of cyclohexane,6,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1511111886,True,"Reading on the ring-flip phenomenon in six-membered cycles, I noticed that the half-chair conformation is depicted a little bit differently in different sources. Like [this](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/~gablek/CH334/Chapter4/CH_HalfChair.png), which has a more cyclopentane-like look, or like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HY88Ha6.jpg), with a more twist-boat-like feel.

Texts also describe this conformation in different ways:

&gt; *""In the half-chair conformation of cyclohexane,* ***four*** *adjacent carbon atoms are in one plane with the fifth above this
plane and the sixth below it. You will meet this conformation again later—it represents the energy minimum for
cyclohexene, for example.""*

Or:

&gt; *""Another conformation which is important in any conformational analysis is the transition state, or maximum energy conformation on the rotational path. For cyclohexane this is the so-called ""half-chair conformation"", in which now* ***five*** *carbons are co-planar, and only one is puckered out of the plane.""*

I know that the half-chair conformation is a transition state with a global energy maximum, so it hardly even matters which is the right one, but the nerd in me keeps asking these questions:

So is it four or five carbon atoms that are co-planar in the half-chair conformation, and why? Which of these is the real transition state?"

(141.4) 12:9.3 Mathematics, material science, is indispensable to the intelligent discussion of the material aspects of the universe, but such knowledge is not necessarily a part of the higher realization of truth or of the personal appreciation of spiritual realities. Not only in the realms of life but even in the world of physical energy, the sum of two or more things is very often something more than, or something different from, the predictable additive consequences of such unions. The entire science of mathematics, the whole domain of philosophy, the highest physics or chemistry, could not predict or know that the union of two gaseous hydrogen atoms with one gaseous oxygen atom would result in a new and qualitatively superadditive substance — liquid water. The understanding knowledge of this one physiochemical phenomenon should have prevented the development of materialistic philosophy and mechanistic cosmology.

(141.5) 12:9.4 Technical analysis does not reveal what a person or a thing can do. For example: Water is used effectively to extinguish fire. That water will put out fire is a fact of everyday experience, but no analysis of water could ever be made to disclose such a property. Analysis determines that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen; a further study of these elements discloses that oxygen is the real supporter of combustion and that hydrogen will itself freely burn.

Recording NMR spectra for aryl boronic acids - overcoming oligomerization,12,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1511264922,True,"I am currently working on synthesising a number of boronic acids such as p-tolyboronic acid, for which I am following a published procedure. 

NMR data usually accompany published procedures for aryl boronic acids, although it is my understanding that boronic acids tend to dimerize/oligomerize which leads to unintelligible spectra.

Is there some trick to overcome this issue? Perhaps running super low concentration samples with higher scan counts? 

For example, from 10.1016/j.tetlet.2010.05.104
NMR for p-toylboronic acid
δH (400 MHz; CDCl3) 8.13 (2H, d, J = 7.7 Hz, ArH), 7.32 (2H, d, J = 7.7 Hz, ArH), 2.45 (3H, s, Me).

Otherwise, is there another easy way to confirm the identity of my synthesised boronic acids?

The compound is a planar molecule (&lt;300 g/mol) with some heteroatoms, can't give away much more than that I'm afraid, and is insoluble in anything other than DMSO.  The compound contains a secondary amine that I wanted to functionalise by bubbling HCl gas through it in MeOH in hopes to form a secondary ammonium cation with chlorine as the counter ion. The mixture went from opaque/cloudy solution to transparent after passing the gas through it, increasing the solubility in MeOH at least and showing that the reaction has most likely worked. However, when I try to dissolve it in water it doesn't go in at all, even with 5% DMSO. I thought that if it formed a salt structure it would go into water readily but that doesn't appear to be the case. Would anyone have any idea of what do to or what might have gone wrong?

The new **non-polar Di-Methyl silicone backbone** of this formula would guarantee a super hydrophobic finish with 100+ degree water contact angles and further improved durability.
We will also be adding in 2 new wax groups for added shine and gloss which will further add to the flexibility of this all in one wax.

A part of my job involves making up batches of metal etching solutions, some for in-house work, some to give to a customer who transports it offsite to a third-party lab.  This most recent job was a bit unsettling though, and although I performed the work safely, the customer handled it poorly.

What i had to make up was 2.5 gallons of a ferric chloride based etchant.  It is essential 3kg of anhydrous FeCl3, mixed into a little less than 3L of water (oversaturation, like 50.5%), then added to a surplus amount of concentrated aqua regia.  The amount of heat and fumes all of this puts off is insane, so much, that part of the procedure is letting it vent for 24 hours in a hood in order to weaken the solution.

Again, I did all of this to the best of my ability wearing enough PPE to pass for a Darth Vader stunt double and no one in my lab was affecting in any way upon me making it.  Until Monday.... This is what the report says:

""The customer came to pick the chemical, and the contents of the smaller container was poured into the larger container outside of the office door at ground level. The smaller, unlabeled container was left on the floor and the larger container was brought upstairs.  The landing on which the etchant was sitting smelled the same as downstairs and was positioned next to the HVAC units supplying the downstairs offices. ""

The end result of this, is my manager telling me that I am now fully responsible for training our customer (a chemical engineer with 40 years of experience) in how to handle chemicals properly.

Is this bullshit?  I mean, car salesmen don't teach people how to drive.

Chemistry Stuff for a Super-Science RPG,5,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1511549980,True,"I'm writing a tabletop role playing game about super-scientists called **Spark of Genius** (think Big Hero 6 meets World of Darkness). Player characters can choose to specialize in different fields of super-science like Omni-Mechanics, Temporal Manipulation, Bioengineering, and Dynamic Energy Physics, then can make inventions and gadgets with those fields, like time machines, robots, clones, laser guns, etc.

One of the fields is **Metachemistry**, which is all about non-organic chemistry, but I need some help. I'm trying to think of what kind of inventions and gadgets I can write up as examples. Each field has five levels to it, here's the general idea of what Metachemistry can do at each level:

* **1:** add or remove a property a substance has, but it has to stay within its type (you can give iron different properties that other metals have, but not make it bouncy like rubber).

* **2:** change the shape of a substance (turn a steel bar into a sword or a shield or metal threads)

* **3:** change a substance into a completely different existing substance of the same type (turn lead into gold, coal into diamonds, air into mustard gas).

* **4:** add or remove properties that substance has with no limits on type (make a bouncy metal, gas that's heavier than water, etc.).

* **5:** change a substance into literally any non-organic material imaginable. Rocks that levitate, gas that changes color based on brainwaves, etc.)

If anyone can help give other examples of cool stuff a super-chemist can do it'd be a big help. Thanks in advance!"

Hybridisation of C-O-C bond in Methyl Methanoate vs. Diethyl Ether?,7,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1511568823,True,"After having recently covered M.O. theory and atomic orbital hybridisation in 'Why Chemical Reactions Happen', I was presented with a few examples in which the HAOs (hybrid atomic orbitals) of each atom involved in bonding was identified. However I came across an organic compound, methyl methanoate, in which there seemed to be a discrepancy in the rules and I was wondering whether someone could explain it to me.

I would have thought that the oxygen involved in the C-O-C bond of methyl methanoate would form sp3 hybrid orbitals. This can be reasoned via steric numbers. There are 2 sigma C-O bonds and 2 lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen. Thus SN = 2 + 2 = 4. A steric number of 4 implies that sp3 hybridisation will occur in which two of the sp3 hybrids will be involved in the C-O sigma bonds and the remaining two unused sp3 hybrids will act as the lone pairs on the oxygen.

Despite my reasoning, the book says that the C-O-C bond angle at the ester oxygen is 127 degrees so sp2 hybridisation is the most appropriate choice. Using this model with have an sp2-sp2 and a sp3-sp2 sigma bond between the two Carbons and Oxygen atom of the ester with a sp2 and a 2p orbital lone pair on the oxygen.

When comparing to other compounds containing a C-O-C bond, I came across diethyl ether. Diethyl ether followed my reasoning in which 4 sp3 hybrids were formed in the oxygen involved and a model as explained above was used. They did not use the sp2 hybridsation model with an sp2 and 2p orbital lone pair on the oxygen as outlined in the paragraph above.

Could anybody explain why this book has used the sp2 hybridisation model for the C-O-C bond in methyl methanoate rather than the expected sp3 hybridisation model?"

So I'm a Sophomore who's on the path to getting their B.S in Chem.  I've heard from several people that a bachelors simply isn't enough to make a decent salary or work a job with benefits.

So my question is, is a Masters worth it?  Med School simply isn't an option, I don't have the passion to pursue that field, and for me, I want to be able to use my 20's to work in the field of Chem, doing work so I can make a salary that can support myself and a partner who is also employed.  
I also don't see myself working towards a PH.D, as time is extremely important to me, and I am reluctant to spend 4-6 years getting a PH.D when the payoff is relatively low.

a) charge a larger sum of money to formulate your product and give that formula to you to manufacture with someone else, or
b) charge a less large amount to formulate and manufacture your product, but the company would own the formula and require you to purchase it for $$$$ if you want it, if they offer that option at all

His research was into analysing DNA and the method blew me away. Apparently protein ion channels were extracted from staphylococcus bacteria and placed in a lipid bi-layer in a &lt;100nm hole in a glass tube which is then suspended in a DNA and KCl solution. Then DNA with a double helix and single helix structure was placed into solution and a charge applied across it to stimulate the DNA to move through the ion channel to the positive electrode. The part that astounded me was the fact that this ion channel was just the right size to allow the single helix part of the DNA strand through but the double strand would get stuck for a matter of seconds! What was even more amazing is that the resistance of having this DNA stuck in the ion channel could be measured in the circuit and fluctuations in the resistance allowed them to analyse this single molecule of DNA as it was trapped. 

Apologies in advance if this post seems tedious as it is coming from the perspective of a naive first year undergrad but I just thought that the concept of trapping a single molecule in such a way was fantastic."

Need a business partner for a lab startup,15,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1511719150,True,"I started a lab in San Luis Obispo County and have been providing various lab services for various industries. I have an industry partner that I work closely with and help sell their instrumentation (this pays most of the bills and is helping fund the lab). The lab is being set up as an analytical lab and a microbial lab (my wife is a micro/molecular biologist). My wife took a second job at an ELAP certified lab to help pay the bills (sacrifices are being made to make this happen) and we also hope that she gains some invaluable knowledge in quality control management and government accreditation and also make great industry connections. I am reaching out on Reddit because I have reached a point where I can no longer handle all this work and responsibility on my own and would like to find a business partner.

The lab is small but is capable. There are ovens, a furnace, head space for a GC with an ECD and FID detector, an HPLC with a UV-Vis detector, UV-vis 96/ 384 plate reader, FTIR with scope attachment, a double stack CO2 incubator, two centrifuges and plenty of glassware. I am currently purchasing an ion trap GCMS with a head space attachment and should be getting a microarray scanner soon. 

Where am I trying to go with the lab?

I have started working with a brewery in San Luis Obispo and spending lots of time setting up the lab to perform QAQC work for breweries. I am also wanting to get into the cider and wine industry and have already made connections with companies. I also partnered with an individual heavily involved in the cannabis industry and I am planning on getting involved with that (I can give more details in person). Other industries I have been working with and will like to continue working with is the cosmetic industry (I find this work fun and I think it can be lucrative). I want the lab to be ISO 17025 certified and I have started this processes so far by research. Oh yeah...food safety and microbiology.

What am I looking for?
I am looking for an individual that has a similar mindset as me. Willing to make sacrifices by moving to a town and willing to start a lab as a business partner and not an employee. I would prefer an individual with at least a masters but a bachelors is totally fine if you have the experience. Experience in QAQC and analytical chemistry is very desirable but other chemistry fields could also work. The individual must LOVE to science and have the desire to improve the world around them. A high ethical standard is a must. You should also like beer and wine since this is going to be a big part of the lab. The individual must also know how to handle stress and turn off (This is going to be an adventure for the both of us and there will be very stressful times. Being able to turn off, step away, go surf and take care of your mental health is very important). But most importantly I want to create a lasting friendship with a nice individual who has a desire to create something.

A little about me. My name is Forrest and I am married and have a dog named Jerry. I am 27 years of age and have a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and soil science. I have experience in analytical chemistry and government contracting/ sales. I surf a lot and love the coast and where I live. My wife and I started this lab together and enjoy the idea of being self-employed and helping our community. I am close to my brothers who run a surf shop in Morro bay. I love beer and wine especially the local stuff and want to see these industries grow in my town. I sometimes can get overly focused on a problem and forget to step away and stress myself out but I am constantly working on this problem.

Selectively Dissolving Metals with Acids,5,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1511817379,True,"Hello folks of r/chemistry, 

I've been looking all over the place trying to find information about which acids dissolve which metals and have not been able to find much on the topic, even in a few textbooks. This came into question because I was trying to think of ways to take my old guitar strings and repurpose them. On the Ernie Ball website, it says that the regular slinky's (the strings I generally use) are made of either nickel-plated steel wrapped around a steel core or tin-plated high carbon steel. I thought it would be cool to maybe use some HCl to dissolve the tin plating and make a stannous chloride solution, which I could then electrolyze to form tin crystals. However, I could not find a solid source that stated that HCl would not dissolve high carbon steel. If anyone could provide any information about this specific situation or, preferably, about the topic of acids and metals in general, it would be greatly appreciated!"

I have worked in my lab for over a year and a half. I don't enjoy the position I'm in. I'm an undergrad research assistant and pretty much a glorified experimenter. I run the same old experiment over and over... Actually, here's a pros and cons list, can someone please advise me on what to do?

Pro:
1. 2~3 publications total (hopefully, 1 down right now, preparing the other)
2. really nice PI (writes me letters for fellowship and recommend me things)
3. pretty stable position
4. everyone is super nice and look out for us undergrads (our lab has a rather unique friendly atmosphere)
5. only lab I've been with, I can stick with it for 4 years to show consistency? 

Cons:
1. always behind, always catching up with my post-doc mentor 
2. don't have any original thoughts (always listening to what post-doc says)
3. completely different field than what I'm interested 
4. not really enjoying my time here
5. scared to voice my own thoughts at this point... a lot of pressure working with a post-doc who doesn't joke around and is serious all the time 



I'd really appreciate any suggestion.





*after reading through the comments, I have decided to consult my post-doc first about a little independence. Now, I do have some additional questions if anyone sees the edit.

1. Undergrad is for getting used to working in lab environment right and learning research methods (baby-steps), right?  Its okay even if I most likely will change my field once I get into grad school, right?
2. When does everything sort of come together for you all? I.e. the moment when you can independently put a project together, plan experiments...etc. rather than be guided every step of the process"

Best polymer to use to re-coat a silnylon rain-fly on a tent?,2,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1511930696,True,"Hi everyone, this might be an odd question, but to me this seemed like the smartest place to come to get an answer. I don't have a very good background in chemistry, hence me being here. Anyway...

I recently picked up a used 4-season tent, the [Exped Orion II Extreme](http://www.exped.com/international/en/product-category/tents/orion-ii-extreme-terracotta). Got an awesome deal and it is in good condition, but I noticed the rain-fly seems to be degrading a little in some places.

I contacted the company and asked them what type of coating they used on their rain-fly, and they told me they were dipped in the silicone at the factory, and that they do not use any DWR coating.

I also asked what product they would recommend to re-coat the rain-fly and they recommended a wax-based product, after the guy I was emailing with apparently asked a co-worker/someone else. This didn't make a lot of sense to me, and I didn't like this answer because I know a wax coating would have to be re-applied annually, if not more frequently and may not be as durable compared to some other products out there.

Particularly, I am curious if it would make sense to re-coat the fly with a fluorocarbon-based product, such as [Fabric guard 503](https://www.amazon.com/303-30674-Upholstery-Protector-Repellent/dp/B0000AY1W7). I know this would add a ""DWR"" finish, but from what I've read and the few videos I've found on it, it seems like this product might be the best at repelling water and still retaining some breathability. And maybe a DWR coating is what I am after?

I guess my question is: what polymer/product should I use on my silnylon rain-fly that will net me the most durable, hydrophobic coating that will retain (at least some level) of breathability? 

I have no idea if applying a fluorocarbon polymer on top of a silnylon material will create a condition that would be detrimental to the fly, or if it would even bond to the silnylon.

Adding flame colorants to nitrocellulose,1,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1511984971,True,"I’m wondering if this is possible and safe to do so (I have a fume hood with scrubbers).

I would take cotton balls and let them soak in 70% nitric acid on an ice bath for a few hours (days? Not sure of the kinetics).  After they finish nitrating, I would wash them with water while adding sodium bicarbonate.  Always add acid to water so that means I’d dip the cotton ball into the water.  Once they’re neutralized, I’ll wash it in distilled water to get rid of sodium.  Then I’ll let them dry.

That’s a pretty standard DIY procedure for making nitrocellulose/guncotton from what I’ve seen on the net.  Here’s my question.

Could I make saturated solutions of strontium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate?  Then I could dip my nitrocellulose balls in these solutions and let them dry.  My thinking is that the water would evaporate away, leaving a fine coat of flame colorant on the fibers.  When I toss them into a fire, would the resulting fireball be colored by the strontium (red) or the copper(II) (green)?  Or would the fire from the nitrocellulose overpower the color?

Also, would a different salt of strontium be better since I might be adding too much nitrate with strontium nitrate?

Most importantly, is this safe?  Not just for me but for the environment as well.

Now, if those are solvents, they quite surely can penetrate the skin within less than 15 seconds, so I fear that right now I have some Methanol and Propylene Glycol + possibly other toxic chemicals in my bloodstream, that could cause toxicity.

I took a brief look at the ingredient list and while I didn't see Methanol being listed, Propylene Glycol was definitely listed. I might have just read it too fast, and thus have possibly missed the Methanol mention, though.

Using tetrafluoroborates to precipitate diazonium salts,21,26,False,False,False,chemistry,1512138018,True,"Hi! I'm a chemistry undergrad and I'm currently working on a research project on the process of precipitating diazonium slats with sodium tetrafluoroborate. I seem to have hit a wall that I just cannot get past. The successful completion of this project is really important for my grade in synthetic chemistry.

The whole problem had begun whilst I was researching and looking for literature on this topic as there seemed to be very little published information. I found a certain article describing a process of firstly diazotisating the aromatic amine and then reacting it with a source of tetrafluoroborate ions. The article stated that the stable diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt will precipitate out of solution, but when I tried to recreate the procedure none of the precipitate formed. 

The procedure goes something like this: Firstly weigh out the aniline and transfer it into a round bottom flask. Submerge the flask in a ice bath. Add 1 M solution of HCl. Then slowly add a solution of sodium nitrite. And finally slowly add a solution of sodium tetrafluoroborate. The precipitate should form right after the addition of the last solution.

And now onto my question: Does anyone have any advice or has personal experience working with diazonium tetrafluoroborates? I have tried many different combinations using different concentrations of reagents, but they all ultimately failed. What could I be doing wrong here? *(So far I have had 5 failed syntheses)*

I thank each and every one of you that will reply to this post as I really don't know what to do.

The first couple of hours worked just fine, a Gas (oxygen) bubbled at the Anode and the copper kathode kept growing (with copper),
while the blue color of the solution fadet away.
But then I started noticing a Gas appearing at the Kathode, it smells like ammonia and is colourless. Could this possibly be SO2?
But why is this happening? I want to get Sulfuric acid and Im concerned about this contaminating my product with H2SO3.
The Kathode is still growing with copper and Solution is still a little blue, so not all Cu2+ Ions can be reacted already.

I have a question about water pH,20,10,False,False,False,chemistry,1512316018,True,"Hello real scientist. I know very little about chemistry outside of what I learned in high school and on the job training while working at a water treatment facility several years ago. My question is, would water with a pH of 6.0 be acidic enough to corrode stainless steel? If not, would heat make a difference in how fast corrosion takes place? I’m asking because heat exchangers in our 17 month old tankless water heater keep rupturing and the manufacture is telling us that our water is too acidic at 6.0 (according to them our water is 6.0, according to my pH meter it ranges from 6.8-7.2). It’s become rather frustrating as this is the 3rd heat exchanger in less than a year and a half. Thank y’all.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded. I wanted to add that we are in well water rather than municipal water so there’s no chlorine present. Our water, per testing, is also not excessively hard. I honestly do not believe it’s the pH at all. My thought is it’s the stainless itself. I’m a welder by trade and a major issue with welding stainless is contraction at the weld joints after it’s been heated. Basically, stainless in general is a pain to deal with when you start heating it and cooling it. It makes me wonder is a stainless steel heat exchanger is a bad idea to begin with because of excessive expansion and contraction."

To me the only thing this will accomplish is bubbling and a release of heat, which should be minor in relation to what you can presumably get from the faucet if you own a bathtub. Is it to add a mild grit? Is it just a psychological thing where the bubbles make it look like it's doing more?"

A bit of background;
I am due to graduate with a Master's in Chemistry (MChem) from a Russell Group university in June 2018. I have decided I want to do a PhD in medicinal chemistry as I find this area really interesting and enjoy working in research. 

I did a year abroad at a small university in the US doing research on a drug discovery project working in synthesis which is due to produce two publications.

So far I have had a fair bit of analytical experience (for an undergrad) with 1D and 2D NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS."

"Making ethyl acetate, the long way.",7,9,False,False,False,chemistry,1512337548,True,"Hey.

So I got myself on a quest to produce (low purity and yield, I'll give you that) ethyl acetate, from household chemicals and basic glassware (no distillation / reflux) and through a Fischer esterification.

So far, I made a solution of sodium acetate from sodium bicarbonate and cleaning vinegar, then boiled down the excess water. I hot filtered everything to remove insoluble impurities (the reagents weren't clean) and boiled off the rest of the water. I then extracted my sodium acetate crystals and got them to dry.

Now, I'm left with quite a lot of crystals, but I need to reacidify the acetic acid. I couldn't use the ~10% ""cleaning vinegar"" as the tremendous amount of water would have made the esterification impossible, so I had to make more concentrated acetic acid. So, normally, I'd acidify it with sulfuric acid and distill off the acetic acid to proceed on with the esterification, but I want to do this without a distillation. So I was thinking about the following:

- Insert the sodium acetate crystals in a container and seal it (we want to keep it dry)

- Turn on the heat to decompose the salt to its anhydrous form

- Add the sulfuric acid slowly: we're now left with sodium sulfate and acetic acid, and the H2SO4 is also a catalyst for the esterification.

- Hopefully the sodium sulfate will pull off some water.

- Add the 95% ethanol and turn on the heat.

- Tricky part: use a flask filled with ice cold water to seal the container. Hopefully it will condense the vapours acting kind of like a reflux condenser.

Basically, to keep the whole synthesis ""ghetto style"", I'm combining the acidification AND esterification. I'd like to hear what you think of it, because to me it's a win-win situation: the sodium sulfate will act as a drying agent in the water sensitive esterification, and I don't have to distill the acetic acid."

I was looking for some advice on a job. I'm a recently graduated Master in Biochemistry &amp; Biotechnology with a strong interest in analytical chemistry. Previously, in internships, I worked with HPLC, GC, MS, NMR and so on and I hope to continue working in the field of instrumental chemistry.
What interested me most of all was always the technical part, not so much the research part. Therefore, I hope to become a service engineer in this field (preferably High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, HPLC and/or Mass Spectrometry, MS). An additional draw of becoming a field service engineer is the ""field"" part, I love to work in an ever changing environment and going to a variety of companies.
Are there any FSE's in this field here that can possibly give me advice? If yes, what would you say are the pro's and the con's of the job? Also, I have very limited experience, is it something that you can learn on the job easily?

A gift for a distance-learner struggling to keep his passion alive,2,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1512437653,True,"Hi all,

Since I can remember, my younger brother has always had a passion for chemistry. As a 12 year old he would read out chemical formulas from many products, talking to me about the active ingredients, what they interact with, etc.... He had the chmiestry bug.

Unfortunately, when it was time for him to go to Uni, life threw many curveballs at him. After a good long 4 years he's finally been able to enroll in a Chemistry B.Sc at a distance-learning program. 

I'd like to help him out and get him something as a present. I know that something he would truly enjoy are lab classes, and being able to see cool chemical reactions happen.

Is there any home mini-lab kit I can get him? Something where he can get some cool experiments done on and truly see that hands-on side of chemistry in first-person?

**TL:DR best home mini-lab kit (w/ a 25 year old's budget!).**

Thanks

 

To the admissions committee,

 

I am writing on behalf of my application for the Doctoral program in Chemistry at the University of X. I have earned a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the Federal University of Viçosa (Brazil) in 2015 and a Master's degree in Inorganic Chemistry from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in 2017. The strong research on catalysis and new synthetic methodologies conducted in your institution made me very interested in pursuing graduate studies at your department.

 

Since sophomore year in college, I have been involved in research projects in the interface between organic and inorganic chemistry, studying new ways to transform abundant and cheap substances into valuable compounds using less toxic reagents and generating less waste. In my Master's thesis I managed to transform compounds extracted from pine trees into biologically-active amines in a one-pot procedure using ethanol instead of toluene as a solvent, a greener approach to the synthesis of amines that led to higher yields and selectivities than the traditional systems already used. In addition, I had the opportunity to take graduate-level courses about group theory, advanced mass spectrometry, nanotechnology and experimental nuclear magnetic resonance which contributed to my understanding of core concepts of my research area. I have also spent the 2012-2013 academic year in the U.S performing research at the University of California Davis as a recipient of the Science Without Borders scholarship. Studying abroad has introduced me to state-of-the-art science and allowed me to operate new instruments and learn new techniques not available in my home institution, besides the rich cultural exchange. In 2016, the American Chemical Society awarded me with a scholarship to travel to Panama, where I received intensive training on scientific outreach and communication. This opportunity has  impacted the way I think chemistry can serve our society and made me realize I can do more for my country than I ever expected through science. Brazil has numerous economic and social inequality problems,and I think one of the most powerful ways to overcome them is through international scientific cooperation and knowledge exchange.

 

Research experience combined with extensive theoretical and practical training received during the baccalaureate and graduate-level courses encouraged me to take a step further in my career as a scientist. My professional goal is to become highly qualified in the field of catalysis and teach at an institution committed to social, economic, environmental and scientific development in my country. The PhD program in Chemistry at the University of Utah is a very good fit for me since it has a structure with all the resources I need to advance in my research, with Dr. X and Dr. Y and Dr. Z groups being very active and relevant to my field. The NMR facility have the capability of multinuclear detection, which is indispensable for my work in the frontier of organometallic chemistry and synthesis, as well as modern mass and optical spectrometers.

 

I am confident that the aforementioned characteristics make me a viable candidate for this graduate program. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my candidacy with the department faculty and provide further information. Thank you for your time and consideration."

How to Avoid Bumping in Steam Distillation?,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1512638954,True,"Within a Soxhlet apparatus, I extracted oil from spent coffee grounds using d-Limonene as the solvent (this is a study comparing it to n-Hexane). The extraction went well, and I now have a mixture of coffee oil and d-Limonene. Due to the high boiling point of d-Limonene (176 °C), I cannot use rotary evaporation to separate it from the oil (my equipment has a max temperature of 80 °C). In the available literature, most authors utilise steam distillation to conduct the separation, followed by phase separation of the d-Limonene and water. The advantage of this procedure is that it can be achieved at the boiling point of water (100 °C).
 

So... here's my problem. I am currently utilising a Dean-Stark apparatus to conduct the steam distillation, in addition to a condenser, heating mantle and round-bottom flask.

Why do Cr and Cu have particularly low first ionisation energies?,1,8,False,False,False,chemistry,1512641124,True,"I was doing some research on Ni and Pd/Pt in the Suzuki reaction when I kind of digressed to look at trends in the first ionisation energies of the transition metals. I plotted a relatively crude graph comparing the actual ionisation energies of the transition metals with the 'ideal' values (just drawing a straight line between Sc and Zn) [Link](https://imgur.com/a/nmjpi). 

Looking at the graph, I'm able to explain why V/Co/Ni have IEs well below the line, because of the exchange energy they gain upon ionisation, since all 3 of them change electron configuration upon ionisation to maximise exchange energy gains.
V goes from 3d3 4s2 to **3d4** in V+
Co goes from 3d7 4s2 to **3d8** in Co+
Ni goes from 3d8 4s2 to **3d9** in Ni+

This rearrangement in electron configuration *doesn't* happen for Sc, Ti or Fe (3d1 4s1, 3d2 4s1 and 3d6 4s1 respectively), so they're much closer to or on the line itself. Mn is also unable to rearrange its configuration, going from 3d5 4s2 to 3d5 4s1 upon ionisation, without any real way to rearrange to gain exchange energy, so it's also relatively close to the ideal line. 

However, I'm stuck trying to explain what happens for Cr and Cu. Both of these elements seem to deviate to the greatest extent from the 'ideal' line, but if we look at the exchange energy gained by both elements upon ionisation, neither of them should stand to gain any exchange energy at all upon ionisation! 

Since the ground state for both Cr and Cu has already rearranged to take advantage of exchange energy, the first IE for both of these elements simply involves removal of a lone 4s electron to give 3d5 and 3d10 electron configurations respectively. There is no stabilisation by exchange energy upon ionisation. 

If we think of it in terms of a Born-Haber diagram, it should look something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/je65V). For V, it hasn't yet 'gained' exchange energy in its ground state as an element, so its actual ionisation energy should be somewhat lower than the 'ideal' IE due to the gain in exchange energy upon rearrangement of its electron configuration as an ion. However, for Cr, they have already gained exchange energy in their ground state, and the difference due to exchange energy in the elemental form should cancel out whatever gain in exchange energy going from 3d4 4s1 to 3d5 in the Cr+ ion. Or more simply put, there is no change in the number of d electrons going from Cr to Cr+, so there should be no change in exchange energy.

Furthermore, the first ionisation for all the other TMs involves removal of a paired electron whereas that for Cr and Cu do not, This seems to suggest that they should be closer to the ideal case, as more energy should be required to ionise them, yet the opposite seems to be true. 

Perhaps the exchange energy is greater for ions, or perhaps there is an energetic benefit to shift electrons from 4s to 3d in the metal ion (presumably the 3d orbital, being more penetrating, is stabilised further by the greater effective nuclear charge in the ion than the 4s orbital) - after all, V does not exist as 3d4 4s1 in its elemental form but exists as 3d4 in V+. But even if there is one, it doesn't really explain why Cr has such a low ionisation energy, since the same effect also benefits V. 

Am I making any mistakes or incorrect assumptions here? 

EDIT: Perhaps one thing missing in the energy level diagram would be the change in shielding effect on ""reconfiguring"" Cr from 3d4 4s2 to 3d5 4s1 in the elemental form? Doing so effectively ""adds"" two d electrons (coming from V, 3d3 4s2) but only one proton. That would lead to significantly increased shielding for Cr as compared to V, which is probably more significant than the difference in exchange energy gained by V/Cr upon ionisation. "

I want to use soils in an Aquaponic setup as I am just not sold (at all)on the actual effectiveness of growing fruiting plants and trees in water alone being nourished by any reasonable amount of fish to do so. Hobby setups are just not viable by any standards in my own opinion. So my idea (roughly) in doing this was trying to unify the two; Aquaponics and Traditional Gardening.  
  

The idea reduces down to just recycling water that's picked up lots of minerals, ions, particulates in Garden beds and fish wells...however, this is not my question. My question(s) arises from the fact that as time goes on and plants are watered from various water sources sodium ions will eventually be left behind as water evaporates from the soil. This sodium that is left behind after each watering builds up in the soil and then dissolves back into the water each time I water my plants. This issue is two fold becasue...plants don't discriminate in ions, they just uptake them until they suffer from various ill effects from toxicity. Also obviously fresh water fish wont enjoy excess sodium either. RIP  

My first solution desperate was to perhaps change it's chemestry, perhaps maybe make it into something more manageable. I was just daydreaming ideas. I thought perhaps using (a dangerous amount of) Ozone in this cycle would create lots of oxygen dissolved in the water as well as Single oxygen atoms too...I then leaned the product of this would not be helpful (maybe).  

1. Would The free atoms from unstable ozone molecules A.) bond with other oxygen atoms to create O2 molecules B.) Bond with Sodium ions to create Sodium Oxide or C.) Both ?  
* If Both, would there be a difference in tendency for oxygen atoms to bond with other oxygen atoms over various ions in the water?  

2. I see many videos where people have said their PH levels dropped as they tried to dissolve more oxygen into the water. I was curious if this was the case where oxygen atoms are creating various hydroxides from various metal ions in the water? I don't think these people are using Ozone in such a case but I do wonder becasue I see it all the time. Something goes wrong in the system then people instantly think, ""oh, it must be the oxygen levels"", and then PH ends up all sorts of out of control. There is very little chemistry DATA and info that I can find in this area.  

3. IF anyone has any idea on how to remove Sodium from water in large quantities via chemestry I'd be open to suggestions. I do not like the mechanical options at all. Distilation. RIP my patience  Reverse O$mosi$.

I don't understand Chemistry but, I've looked around and there isn't much info on this...especially in Aquaponics circles. I've seen various methods to create Sodiumhydroxide but not so much as how to break it down or convert into something not so corrosive it doesn't seem to have any use case other than being destructive. This doubles for Saline water from Gardens, it's like no one has ever thought to recycle that water that has a lot of good things in it for plants but, just a lof salt as well.

How can organic chemists do research in the pharmaceutical field? Or  was it just a rare eventuality? How can I improve my chances to do that? (In Pavia, where I want to go There is a merit College where I would have to do addition  exams of my choice,  should I do biochemistry? )

Help with reducing elemental sulfur,16,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1512694894,True,"**TL;DR**: Does anyone know of alternative reducing agents that I can use to reduce elemental sulfur to sulfide? My current method is briefly described below.  

I need to synthesize [34S]-dimethylsulfide (DMS). To do this, I reduce [34S] elemental sulfur to sulfide with DTT under anaerobic conditions. Next, I acidify the reduced sulfur with HCl to liberate the H2S from the solution, and the H2S(g) is trapped in 0.5M NaOH. This solution is transferred to a round bottom flask, and iodomethane is added in order to methylate the sulfide to DMS. Finally, I distill the [34S]-DMS from the methylation reaction.  

Using unlabled S0, I am getting ~40% yields of sulfide. This isn't great due to the price of labeled elemental sulfur. I suspect that my yield would be much higher if I didn't have to acidify the sulfide and recapture it in NaOH. It is my understanding that the acidification is necessary to purify the sulfide from the DTT. Is there another reducing agent that I could use to convert elemental sulfur to sulfide that would not interfere with the methylation reaction? I have been having trouble finding this information online.

Anyway, I [26F] will be transferring into UCSC (undergraduate) next fall as a chemistry major (concentration environmental chemistry). I feel like I have chosen the right major for myself and do not plan on changing it, I was hoping to get some advice on what to expect as an environmental chemistry major in my academic and professional careers. 

No one in my family has gone to college, and there are not a lot of people I know personally that I can ask for advice on this topic. I am hoping to have an industry job where I can work in a lab and possibly do field work as well. I have researched the major some and discussed with one of my chemistry professors, but I would like some personal responses. 
Has anyone on here graduated with an environmental chemistry degree? 
Was going into the workforce after graduating difficult? 
Is the school material/career what you expected? 
Do you enjoy what you do?

I am highly considering going to grad school after undergraduate (probably not right away) either to further my career as a chemist or possibly to go into environmental engineering if possible. I am very interested in environmental engineering as well. Does anyone know if it is possible to move into graduate school for environmental engineering with an undergraduate degree in environmental chemistry?

MaSO4 • 7H2O more soluable???,7,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1512766020,True,"So makeing scented bath salts with my daughter using distillate waters. Noticed that the MaSO4 dissolved more than it should have. So i looked it up and turns out epsom salts were a monoclinic crystal (water of crystalisation). (I had no idea). I couldn't find out how much would dissolve so i did the math. Found about 200 grams per 100 ml would be just over solubility for 100°c. But when i added it, it dissolved readily. So i added a bit more in. And more and more and it kept taking it. I finnaly got to about 450 grams before the mixture became cloudy and particulates began forming around the center and wouldn't dissolve.  

So if MaSO4 is supposed to be around 50 g per 100ml @100°c. Why was i able to dissolve 450 grams of MaSO4 • 7H2O?

Somebody on another forum said i should figure out the lattice constant of MaSO4 crystals but i'm not a real scientist and anhydrous MaSO4 isn't a crystal, so i wouldn't know where to start. Plus i'm adding in energy to the reaction with heat already so i wasn't sure why energy from crystals dissolving would play a big part. Especially if thermal energy already bad a clear effect on the solutions ability to absorb material.

Any helps figuring out why this happens would be a big help. Not that it is a problem, it means we got a higher yield of scented bath salts, but it is something where she was like ""so the internet was wrong?"" And i was like, ""that can't be true!""

Tl:dr why does 450 grams of MaSO4 •7H2O  dissolve in water at 100°c if only about 200 grams should be able to?"

I'm proposing on comparing different condenser types in terms of Liebig, as it is one of the most often used condensers in chemistry and many people are familiar with it. So if a 10cm condenser would be equivalent of using a 30cm Liebig, we would say it is 3 times as efficient as Liebig, and we could start comparing even weird condensers to each other by a simple number."

What to major in to become a pharmaceutical scientist?,21,14,False,False,False,chemistry,1512927959,True,"Hello, I am a junior in high school interested in entering the field of drug creation or the like. Pharmaceutical scientist looks like it fits what I want to do. However I don’t know what to major in if I were to become one.

• Chemistry
• Pharmaceutical Chemistry
• Biochemistry

Which one of these three (or any other major that I probably don’t know about) would be the best? I’m assuming Pharmaceutical Chemistry?

However, if I were to change my mind, which major would offer me a viable backup career?

[Story] Why I hate thiols,19,20,False,False,False,chemistry,1513112538,True,"I was working in the lab at my university for a project in my second year. We were working with benzenethiol. I was warned that this chemical smells terrible, so I worked very carefully and kept everything I worked with under the fume as much as possible. When weighing samples, I was extra careful to check if everything was sealed off properly and everything went pretty well for the most part. 

The first time I was introduced to the terrible odor of this chemical was when I was making some dilutions and I had some vials where I would put a droplet of benzenethiol in and dilute it with something. I was not entirely sure if one of them was empty or if it already had a droplet in it. So, I thought it would be a good idea to see if I can smell if there is anything in there. Very cautiously I try to smell from the vial, but I did not smell anything. I presumed it was empty but I thought I should give it another try, so I put the vial a little bit closer and smell again and ""AAggghhhhh!"". The most nauseating stench I have ever smelled penetrates my nose. It was so bad, I even got a bit dizzy from that and had to get some fresh air before I could continue working.

This was not everything yet, because when I decided to clean my workspace, I used tissues to clean up spilled bits, collected the plastic pipette nozzles and without thinking threw everything in the regular contaminated trash bin. It did not take very long until I realized what a terrible mistake I made because within minutes the whole lab was filled with a terrible thiol odor. It smelled so bad that we needed to take regular breaks to get some fresh air because the smell was so nauseating. My poor fellow students and I had to work for two days in that lab with this awful scent.

I have asked around the chemistry department and a professor has highlighted a Summer course in a department in Germany which seems really interesting. 

So my questions for you all are: 

- Did you have a summer job relevant to Chemistry?

- At what point in your degree did you undergo this placement?

- What kind of options are out there? I know of some few and far between R&amp;D internship opportunities in companies and then University courses like the one I mentioned above in Germany

- What was your experience?

- How well did it set you up later on in your degree/ career?

I made A’s in both accompanying labs on the first try, but when it comes to the lectures, I can’t even squeak by.

These were nearly a $1 a piece and from what we could see they'd could probably pull a car let alone hold up a lowly tree.

Now the Institute has perfected a beverage which is expected to revolutionise human society. It is a pink liquid and after a glass of it you feel rather seedy. A second glass and you are depressed.

In fact, I've gone through a few of them, but everyone is on a different path. I'd really appreciate if anyone can shed some light on my situation and advice me on what to do next. 


Some background, I'm currently a sophomore undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill, majoring in B.S. Chem. For the longest time I wanted to pursue a Ph.D. and become a PI. I started working in a lab first semester freshman  year. Things are going well in terms of research! I landed a second authorship and am working on a new project. I'm absolutely loving my time in lab. In fact, I feel like I've spent more time in lab than anywhere else (16~ish hours per week). My GPA was 3.85 entering this semester. But, I failed to balance my classes, extracurricular activities, and lab. I was really overwhelmed by many things, such as family issue and health. For example, I was hospitalized for an entire week half way through the semester (not because of school). My GPA took a hit, and is now a 3.65. I'm taking a few honors classes next semester. So my GPA will only go down hill from here.


I want to attend top programs like Berkeley. I admire a few labs in these programs and want to join them. Now, what exactly should I do to make up for a bad GPA? Chemistry program at UNC is really tough... At best, I will end up 3.6-ish, if not 3.4-3.5~ish. Should I compensate this by attending more conference and be even more active in my research project and attempt to land a first author? If everything goes well, I will most likely end up with 2-3 second authorship. So far, I've presented at 3 conferences and will continue to present more. I know I'm only a sophomore, and there will be time for potential improvements. But, I don't see light T_T. I feel trapped in a dark tunnel and am losing passion and motivation.

My salt responds perfectly to the sulfate anion test: HCl + salt (aq) + BaCl2 gives me a white precipitate.

However, when I add Heating+ HNO3 + salt (aq) and then later added AgNO3 to confirm that it's not sulfite or a halide, i get a white precipitate, meaning that it's supposed to be chloride. I heated it to make sure it's not sulfite, but the precipitate didn't go away; the solution turned from white to clear after rigorous shaking, but a white precipitate still floated on the top of the solution.

Now I'm kinda stuck and need help. Is sulfate supposed to do this? Does this mean it's sulfite? Or did I just contaminate my sample with a halide (somebody else was testing for halides earlier but I did clean out everything), or did I do the heating wrong to get rid of the sulfite, or what?

Best way to determine the conductivity of reduced graphene oxide when your school has barely any instruments,1,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1513380773,True,"Hi guys,

I'm in my senior year of obtaining my BS in chemistry and for my senior research project I need to ultimately measure/determine the conductivity of the reduced graphene oxide I'm producing. I use vacuum filtration to collect the reduced graphene oxide and place it into a test tube as is once I get it off from the filter paper, so its like kind of clumpy-ish and not a sheet or anything. I'm not so sure if I can press it into a sheet without damaging it, and I don't know if placing it in a solution is really an option since I want to see if there's any impurities, etc. 

My school has absolutely no electron microscopes and nothing as far as to do with the high frequency eddy-current method.   I have no real way of determining the size of the graphene I produced unless I could do something really crude and measure it with a ruler, assuming I can make it into a sheet. 

I picked a project surrounding electrochemistry because we don't learn much of it in our courses so I'm not entirely experienced in some of these techniques, hence why this question may seem dumb. I assume the four point probe method will be my best option but it's impossible to do when I cannot accurately determine the size of the graphene since its clumped together the size of your pinky nail. Is it okay if I press it into a uniform sheet? I'm lost on how to approach this.  "

[QUESTION] Stability of [Fe(CN)6]3- over [Fe(CN)6]4-,10,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1513418306,True,"It is well known that [Fe(CN)6]3- is much more stable than [Fe(CN)6]4- with its dissociation constant several orders of magnitude lower than that of the latter. This is the reason behind the fact that these two following reactions yield the same product:

FeCl2 + K3[Fe(CN)6] = KFe[Fe(CN)6] + 2KCl

FeCl3 + K4[Fe(CN)6] = KFe[Fe(CN)6] + 3KCl

AIn the latter case the resulting anion has its central iron oxidized to Fe(III) since that would lead to the formation of a more stable complex.

But why does this have to be so? I looked into one of my textbooks on chemistry of elements, and there it states that a Fe(III) would have an easier time surrounding itself with negative ligands. But shouldn't Fe(II) be a better suite for pi backdoning? It has more electron density to start with, so more of it should be available for donation onto the antibonding pi orbital of CN-.

Also, [Fe(CN)6]3- is one electron short from conforming to the 18 electron rule, and [Fe(CN)6]4- has exactly 18 electrons. So, then again, why is [Fe(CN)6]3- more stable when there're certainly effects that should make it less stable comparing to [Fe(CN)6]4-? If it's really just the oxidation state of the central irons, how come it overrides every other contributing factor?

Thanks beforehand."

I need to get a LIMS...HELP!,6,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1513699734,True,"Hello all,

I am an undergraduate student employee at my university. I run the prep lab for the general chemistry courses here.

This job has a pretty high rate of turnover. If grad students fill the position, they just do it until they get a teaching assignment. If an undergrad does it, they're here until the graduate or quit, since the grad students treat us like monkeys. This lab has been running for 20 years and most people leave within a year or two of starting. We prep for about 1000 students every week with a staff of 3 people.

Our problem: We have no system for inventory management. The environmental department here on campus has requested that I do a full chemical inventory of our lab.  I could do something in excel pretty easily, however, I'd really like to establish a long term solution that will help the next generation of prep people.

Im somewhat familiar with LIMS as a concept because I've been working at an environmental lab part time for a few years, but their LIMS has more bells and whistles than I really need - I just need a program that can record stock solutions and any working standards/dilutions we use.

Thanks for any and all help!

Why do 8 electrons form a stable shell?,8,6,False,False,False,chemistry,1513750134,True,"Hey guys. It might be a silly question but please understand I just started studying Chemistry haha. Why do 8 electrons form a stable shell for every elements? 

I get that for the lowest energy shell (n=1), l and m are both 0, so this means there is only one allowed combination with n=1. Also, since electrons can be spin up or spin down, there are two total slots available. And this is why hydrogen and helium are stable with 2 electrons because those two electrons fill the n=1 shell. 

For the same reason, there are eight total slots available in the second shell (n=2, I=0,1, m =-1 to 1). So, second row elements like C, N, O would be most stable with eight electrons in the second shell. 

My question is, why wouldn’t third row elements be most stable when there are 18 electrons since the third shell can have up to 18 electrons? For example, why does Cl want to gain one electron to follow the octet rule instead of losing 7 electrons to follow ""the 18 rule""? How does the octet rule apply to not only second shell, but also third, fourth, - - - shells?

"Need help identifying ""contagious"" chemical odor",9,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1513764989,True,"Hi chemistry,

I've come across something very strange and need your help identifying what this chemical could be and if it's harmful to humans. 

I recently bought a new backpack (made of Cordura and other plastic fabrics). When I unpacked the backpack from it's factory wrapping I noticed that it smelled a bit ""plastic"" and ""chemical"". I assumed this smell came from the plastic wrap and that the bag would air out quickly. 

I ended up using the backpack for a day and when I got home I realized that the smell was still there. I unpacked it and inspected the inside, which turned out to reek of this very strong ""chemical"" smell. Worse, many of the items I carried in the bag had acquired the same smell in varying degrees. The strangest thing is that a scarf that was carried in the bag managed to transfer the smell to my winter coat just by me wearing the scarf under the coat. 

I've since washed the coat twice and the smell is still present. As of right now, the backpack is in a sealed plastic bag on my balcony. I've thrown away many of the cheaper items that were in the bag. I'm still hoping to get the smell out of my winter coat, a kindle reader and a plastic laptop. 

I'm worried that _whatever_ this is, it could be toxic as it seems to be very volatile, spreading easily between plastic objects. Any ideas what this could be? The fact that it only spreads to plastic objects seem to be a clue. Another details is that I bought two almost identical bags (same manufacturer, different colors), but only one of them has this problem. The other one has no smell at all.

I've contacted the manufacturer, so far without a response. I'll give you an update when they get back to me.

Thanks!"

Specifically, I'm targetting [either of these fragments](https://imgur.com/a/Bmxnn), and so far the best I've come up with is [this](https://imgur.com/a/Pi2Gt). It's about 10 steps (plus 3-4 steps for the alkylzinc reagent from protected acrolein), which I guess is fair enough for a molecule like this, but there are a couple of iffy steps in there. I don't know if the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling can be chemoselective for the trans bromide (I got the idea from this paper by Negishi, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200353022/full).

Can hydrogen bridging explain water's fluidity?,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1513822378,True,"Looking at a creek of running water near my house, I noticed that the water - in a path with greater declivity and, thus, more intense current - seems to be ""pulling itself,"" as if the water in the middle section of the declivity was ""pulling like a chain,"" the water in the upper part of the river. This sparked three questions:


1 - Am I insane? That is, is what I observed really a thing? Or am I just seeing this phenomena because I know about H2O's strong polarity, and that is supposed to create a capillarity effect? 


2 - If I'm not insane, does that mean that - given a perfectly flat river with the exception of one section - because of water molecules' attraction to each other, water flow in the upper section of the river (prior to the single declivity in our ""perfect river"") is faster? 

In other words, if our ""perfect river"" had mercury flowing in it - or any other liquid whose molecules' polarity is negligible -, would it be slower than water?

The temperature dependence of solubility can be exploited to prepare supersaturated solutions of certain compounds. A solution may be saturated with the compound at an elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and subsequently cooled to a lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains solute at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is relatively stable. Precipitation of the excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal (see the video in the Link to Learning earlier in this module) or by mechanically agitating the solution.

Polyurethane safety,7,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1513828605,True,"Hello :)  For Christmas, I am staying at my great aunt's house.  Yesterday, before I got there, she finished a table with polyurethane and promptly threw away the container (no way to tell if water based or oil based).  It is a 2x8 coffee table.  It seemed dry, so she had us put a glass top on top of it.  Before this, it smelled but, after the top was put on, it stopped smelling.

Now, this is a small house, and there really is no other place to socialize besides the living room where the coffee table is.  She is also not one to negotiate.  With the smell gone, is it safe to assume that I could avoid harmful offgassing?  I will be here for five days."

Question about Quantum number,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1513975354,True,"Hey guys,

So I am studying for CLEP Chemistry and came across the question that I don't really understand its answer.

Which of the following sets of quantum numbers describes the highest energy valence electron of nitrogen in its ground state? 
(A) 2, 0, 0, +1/2 
(B) 2, 1, 1, -1/2 
(C) 2, 1, 1, +1/2 
(D) 2, 1, -1, -1/2 
(E) 2, 1, -1, +1/2

I thought the valid answers should be either B, C, D, or E because the energies of the electrons increase as the sum n + l (Principal quantum number + angular momentum quantum number) increase, and for two electrons with equal values of n+l, the one with the lower n value has lower energy. At least this is how I learned from the textbook.

However, the answer is (C) according to the answer sheet. 


My understanding is that only the first two quantum numbers (n, l) affect the energy of the electrons, since those are the only two that determine the distance between the nucleus and electrons.

Am I understanding this wrong? I would greatly appreciate any help!"

Hey Chem Community,
I am a philosophy graduate student reading some stuff about science and complexity and the Platt 1961 paper (linked above) was cited in a book by Herbert Simon called The Sciences of the Artificial. Simon is someone whom I plan on including heavily in my thesis and found this citation rather interesting. As someone with quite minimal knowledge about chemistry and its history (this probably also counts in molecular biology) I am wondering if anyone here knows how well the ideas about emergence and higher-level properties in Platt have held up? Have there been any published criticisms of these results that have also stood out?

I have gone through the ""cited by"" on google scholar and nothing stood out at first glance, however, that could be down to my light combing.

It has become convention in my undergrad studies to use the formal method of electron counting in organometallics &amp; TM complexes, however this starts to break down when looking at metal-enyl complexes and the like - and it becomes beneficial to use the Green method of electron counting.

[2017/12/24] Synthetic Challenge (substitute #3 Inorganic),62,27,False,False,False,chemistry,1514104670,True,"**Intro**

Hello everyone! 

Welcome to the festive edition of the weekly synthetic challenge! And by festive the only festive thing is the date and the fact I'm wearing reindeer antlers. Ok so it is just the date...

This also happens to be our first inorganic synthetic challenge, please have a go I know they are a bit odd but I think you should be able to figure it out.

Next challenge will be back to organic and be made by /u/spectrumederp or /u/critzz123

The goal for the inorganic week isn't so much that I expect you to be able to work it out, it is more to encourage some reading outside your normal field. You never know what ideas things like this might create in different people. It also gives you a taste of what us strange synthetic inorganic chemists make in our labs, this hopefully is especially interesting for any undergrads looking as in most places you don't really get to see this very often.

Please do have a go, let me know if they are too weird or if you’d like it harder/easier for next time.

**Format**

So since this is our first inorganic synthesis challenge I can't really say what difficulty things are, we'll figure that out as we go on! So what we have is three molecules;

The first is a platinum complex that I think any chemist should be able to have a good attempt at. Start by making the ligands, then figure out what platinum species would work best and what order to put them on it. Making the ligands should feel more like the organic weeks.

The second is an N-heterocyclic phosphenium cation, I gave it a [BF4]^- counter ion but that isn't a big deal, feel free to use another anion - there are some smart ways to get there.

The third is going to look really random and scary to most of you probably, can confirm it does not explode! Although your suggested starting material might be a bit more fun to work with... There are quite a few ways I could picture making it, you'll probably need to do some googling :)

Are common solvents affected by short wave UV?,13,7,False,False,False,chemistry,1514213108,True,"Hey chemists. I'm thinking about attempting some short wave UV decomposition (I have some impurities in my sample which are UV sensitive).

Do I have to worry about UV decomposing the solvent or any other reactions? I tried searching online but mostly just get TLC related results.

The only one that I have some info on is acetone. From the wiki:  
&gt;Acetone evaporates rapidly, even from water and soil. Once in the atmosphere, it has a 22-day half-life and is degraded by UV light via photolysis (primarily into methane and ethane.[49])

Bicarb/Ascorbic Acid Stain,2,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1514249652,True,"So, my younger brother got a do-it-at-home rocket kit for Christmas this year and we decided to try it out. The instructions called for a mixture of water, citric acid, and baking soda that wasn't included with the kit. We had no citric acid and with everything being closed, I suggested to him we use ascorbic acid instead to fuel the release of carbon dioxide and launch the rocket. 

Long story short, it worked out pretty well but the resulting takeoff got the reaction mixture all over me and my white sweatshirt (bad move on my part I know, it was cold). It left an odd yellow colored stain on the sweatshirt. I did a little googling to see what would lead to yellow stains (ascorbic acid, bicarb, sodium ascorbate) but nothing came up. Now obviously I'm looking to get the stain out, but I'm more interested in what caused the yellow coloring in the reaction if anyone has an idea. The starting materials and the products of the reaction seemed pretty clear minus the stain? Any ideas on what it is or how to get it out of clothes without ruining the new sweatshirt?"

Applying to Grad School (long),28,2,False,False,False,chemistry,1514347982,True,"I'm going through the process of applying to grad school and I wanted to ask a few question. But first, a bit of background. I'm graduating next semester. All I have is 2 more labs then I graduate. My GPA right now is a 4.0, but I took the GRE and did pretty poorly (305, 3.5). The school I'm graduating from isn't great! I have one semester of research and a semester of TAing. As far as my favorite subject, I don't really have just one. I really do like everything. But I kinda have to take in to account my very limited experience. I freaking loved research. I did the nearly the same reaction every day for months and got nada! Then bam! New product. My favorite part about doing research was going home, reading some relevant literature, pulling out my notebook, and writing a ton of ideas for troubleshooting. The only reason I didn't continue doing research was that I felt like I was kind of a bother to the grad student in the lab. I had my own project but it felt like I was being babysat lol. Also, I felt like I was invading his space and negatively affecting his productivity. Anyway, I can see myself doing anything. 

Now, my questions. First, how did you approach the application process? By that I mean, the CV and the personal statements. Right now my CV is pretty skeet haha. I have 5 or 6 award/honors, and my TA and research experiences. I also had an interests section but someone told me to delete it. My personal statement is nonexistent. I haven't even started. How exactly do you write about the groups you're interested in? Just like ""Dr. X is doing Y and it looks cool?""

Second, the schools. Is there any way I could narrow down my selection so that they're safer? I'm looking at state universities in Michigan, Oregon, and Washington. Preferably Oregon or Washington. I like trees, rain, the outdoors, etc. They also put me closer to the ocean! With my scores should I just aim for some lower ranked schools? Also, I've been looking at research groups. Most of my reactions are ""yeah, I could see myself doing that"" or ""Nooo, that guy has way too many students!"" How'd you select a group?

Third, what was your experience like when you started doing research? This question is mainly for those with little research experience (like me). Did you feel lost? Stuck?  

Finally, a question for the minorities out there (like me) lol...Were there any other people like you? Obviously, this isn't a dealbreaker or really even that important. Being the only black guy in class is actually something I've gotten use to. But sometimes I feel like a unicorn or leprechaun or something lol. Occasionally, I'll have a chemistry class with another black guy. We'll briefly make eye contact all the way from across the room (we sit far apart so we're less noticeable, it doesn't work) and we'll give each other a quick nod when the instructor isn't looking, but he always sees this and pauses to ask if everything's alright. When I'm looking at PI's, sometimes I think, ""This guy! Take a look at him. He's definitely got a black friend or two!"" How the hell did I go off on this tangent? Sorry. You just have to realize the following fact: all black people think about is race! Just kidding lol...or am I? Jk! What am I going on about? Grad school!

Gimmie some advice! Please and thank you.

Haven't taking chemistry since high school. Taking biochem in 16 days. What to focus on to prepare?,5,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1514580730,True,"Hi folks - I hope this is a good place to ask this question.

I graduated college a couple of years ago with a double major in Psych and a foreign language. I am trying to pivot my career towards neuroscience (I'm currently working in neuroscience right now and loving it). I work at a university lab, and as an employee I get a steep discount on tuition, so I've decided to take a class to potentially prepare for grad school. As a psych major, I had many classes with neuro components, but did not take a lot of the 'hard science' coursework - my current plan is to take biochem, molecular and cellular biology, and a couple other courses to prepare for eventually applying to neuro grad school. Point is, I have to take biochemistry to start this path.

Thing is, I haven't taken chemistry since high school. I've talked to lots of people who have taken this class and they've assured me I can do it - my best friend was a lab instructor for O chem and Gen chem at our college, so I've got some help there. I feel underprepared, but everyone keeps telling me I'll be fine, so I decided to do it.

The class starts in 16 days, and I want to know - what topics should I try to study up on to prepare myself for biochem, in spite of my complete lack of experience in chemistry? Are there specific topics in gen chem or O chem I should focus on? I'm planning multiple study sessions with my lab instructor friend to give me a crash course in what I might need, but she hasn't taken biochem, so she's not sure what I should focus on to prepare myself.  She's armed me with all her notes and her old textbooks for gen chem and O chem, so hopefully they will help too. I also plan to do some Khan Academy studying to help combat my lack of knowledge.

For context, this is just an introductory biochem course.

Any help would be much appreciated!

Some questions about thermite...,17,0,False,False,False,chemistry,1514654301,True,"1) Why are containers necessary? So wind doesn't move it? Are the particles liable to splatter during ignition?

2) Can thermite be bonded to tape or glue, for a controlled kind of detonation. Like you tape a square on a wall, ignite and boom, you knocked out a near perfect square? I have seen people mix iron oxide and glue to make a kind of magnetic playdough, what's stopping us from making thermite into a spreadable, pliable magnetic playdough substance? Would the reaction be hindered too much? Not enough Oxygen inside the dough?

3) Is iron oxide truly the best material to mix with aluminum? Or is the reaction just the most consistent? I know red iron oxide is slightly better in that it requires less to burn hotter than black iron oxide.

4) If someone wanted to stop the reaction, would sand be ideal? Since the heat is so high water would probably evaporate too quickly and make a nasty (hot) steam.

5) Say I was trying to make steal and made it to the end of the reaction, would hitting the red hot steel with a hammer aid significantly in destroying it?"
Would anyone be willing to translate this description of Cannabidiol from PubChem into layman's terms?,8,5,False,False,False,chemistry,1514655844,True,"I work with cannabis plants high in Cannabidiol and found this description but cannot really comprehend it:

Cannabidiol is a phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis species, which is devoid of psychoactive activity, with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and chemopreventive activities. Upon administration, cannabidiol (CBD) exerts its anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic activity through various mechanisms, which likely do not involve signaling by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), CB2, or vanilloid receptor 1. CBD stimulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inhibits AKT/mTOR signaling, thereby activating autophagy and promoting apoptosis. In addition, CBD enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further enhances apoptosis. This agent also upregulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1) and decreases the expression of inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID-1). This inhibits cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. CBD may also activate the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 (TRPV2), which may increase the uptake of various cytotoxic agents in cancer cells. The analgesic effect of CBD is mediated through the binding of this agent to and activation of CB1.

Advice for running columns?,18,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1514660275,True,"Beginning chemist here. I'm coming back to lab in a couple of days and I have some columns to run. Really nervous about it.

My mentor has shown me how to run columns and I ran one with him once but it didn't go that great. This time around I want things to go at least decently. Any tips for a first timer? Any great videos to watch? My compound is colored so I don't have to worry about clear columns but I'm sure there's a lot of other stuff I have to keep track of.

Some of the points that I'm not sure about are 1. How hard I can push down on the column with the air stream without bumping it? 2. How can I best layer my sand to make sure it doesn't get lopsided especially the top layer? 3. How quickly do I have to put my dissolved crude compound onto the sand?"
"Textbooks: Zumdahl's ""Chemistry"" vs Silberberg's ""Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change"" - which one would /r/chemistry recommend for a math major whose chemistry knowledge is really, really rusty?",36,49,False,False,False,chemistry,1514664928,True,"Hi everybody, title is pretty self-explanatory here! I'd love to dig into chemistry on a university level, but my high school chemistry knowledge is really rusty to the point where I absolutely want (and *need*) to start from scratch again (it's been 5 years since I graduated from high school).

Did some research on suitable general chemistry books on the beginning college level that would fit the bill, and came across Zumdahl's general chemistry book, and Silberberg's ""Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change"" . 

I peeked inside, and from the looks of it they're quite similar. Silberberg seems to have the upper hand when it comes to the quality of the graphics and drawings, and also has these ""Chemical Connections"" bits at the end of sections in which he goes into a topic related to the rest of the chapter, which I really appreciate as a matter of broadening my knowledge. 

On the other hand, Zumdahl is in the /r/chemistry book recommendations list, is apparently considered a more serious and college-level appropriate book by some, and has a nice appendix section on basic statistics/basic error analysis and on the Quantitative Kinetic Molecular Model. This tells me that this book doesn't shy away from some cool fundamentals just because it involves math, which is something else I really appreciate.

In conclusion: I'm torn. I feel like Silberberg might be the more accessible book, also in how he sometimes allows himself to write longer paragraphs in order to get a point across. Yet, on other occasions, Zumdahl seems to be the clearer and more pedagogical one. Again, I'm torn, so your recommendations and input would be really helpful!"

Impolar compound get through column slower,3,1,False,False,False,chemistry,1514688003,True,"Hello /r/chemistry !
I really need your help on this one : I want to purify my crude of my reaction. Among the spots on TLC, I have some baseline-struck compounds (I assume it's salt the the acid I used in my reaction), and a few spot that move better. I think my compound of interest is a spot with a RF around 0.3.
I did run out my column, and right as my compound start to get out, I get a lot of mixed fractions compound/stuff that stick to the baseline. Even worse, I get afterward some fractions of pure ""compound that stick to the baseline"" and afterwards I get again fractions of the moving compound ! So the compound get out of the column afterwards but elute faster on TLC !

Anyone got an explanation/solution for this ? My compound has a free hydroxyle, that may play a role."

How do chemists know they have a purified unknown sample?,51,61,False,False,False,chemistry,1514716256,True,"So I've always been wondering how this works. 

Say you want to extract some ingredient in a plant extract. Call the compound in interest Chemical A. Problem is, you have NO idea what structure or chemical properties Chemical A has. To start the extraction, you might add in a known reactant with an -OH group. But what if the -OH is moved to Chemical A, so now you have (Chemical A)-OH? 

How could you know that the compound you extracted, which is (Chemical A)-OH, is actually impure and that you need to remove -OH to get only Chemical A? Remember, you have no prior knowledge of anything about Chemical A, only that it exists, so there seems to be no way to know if your compound in interest is actually (Chemical A)-OH in the purified form, or if (Chemical A)-OH is an impurified form.

Enlighten me!"
Looking for chemical composition of common produce,13,3,False,False,False,chemistry,1514738729,True,"I apologize if this is in the wrong place, looking at sidebar I didn’t see anything to disqualify this post.

**TL;DR Looking for chemical composition of common produce to perform aerobic decomposition reaction calculations to determine how much CO2 is produced. **

I am running a small compost and would like to know how much CO2 is produced from a given input of organic matter. So far I’ve only been using veggie,fruits and yard trimmings. 

What I am looking for is information on chemical composition of common produce (i.e broccoli, grapefruit, spinach etc.) so that I could perform theoretical reaction calculations and then test results.

My next challenge would be to separate CO2 from air. I assume I’d have to do this in a closed container. I have a very basic understanding of gas dynamics, but from what I understand so far, CO2 in concentrated form without diffusing forces will not diffuse and dilute so therefore your chances of separating a high concentration of CO2 is improved. 

My level of chemistry knowledge is up to freshman level chemistry. So any clarifications or guidance would be greatly appreciated!
